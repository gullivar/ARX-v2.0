We're simply supported by sponsored adverts and promotions dotted around the site and sometimes retailers will also pay us a bonus if we send a lot of shoppers their way. Will it cost me anything? TopCashback is completely free to join, and if you opt for a classic account then there won't be any charges whatsoever. If you opt for a Plus account, then £5 of your annual cashback earnings will be deducted and you'll receive a range of additional benefits. How does cashback work? When you make a purchase from a retailer featured on TopCashback after clicking through from our site, the retailer will give us a commission for sending you to their website. We share this commission with you when you earn money, which we call 'cashback' and is actually paid by the retailer. Then, we'll make your cashback 'payable' for you to withdraw and spend. When will I actually get my cashback? Cashback should appear on your Earnings page within 7 days of your purchase, but it usually isn't ready to withdraw straight away. We need to wait until the retailer's returns period is over before they confirm your cashback, and then once the retailer has paid us the commission for your purchase, we'll make your cashback 'payable' and ready to withdraw and spend. What can I get cashback on? You’ll find great cashback rates on everything such as airport parking & car hire, home insurance, mobile phones including the latest iPhones and Samsungs, as well as your favourite fashion and homeware brands. Unlike other UK cashback sites, you can compare cheap broadband deals and insurance policies to find the best offer for you, with cashback on top. Almost all of your online purchases will be eligible; browse over 6,000 retailers to start saving money. What payout methods are available? Withdrawing your cashback rewards is easy and you can do it in more than 60 different ways, such as to your bank account, PayPal account or as gift card, which can include a bonus of up to 20%. Some of our most popular giftcards include: Virgin ExperienceDays, Just Eat, Amazon, Google Play and Love2Shop amongst dozens of others.
