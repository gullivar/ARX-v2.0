Frequently Asked Questions
What is a live chat platform?

Live chat is a simple and powerful way to connect with your customers, whether it’s on your website or through a dedicated chat page. With an easy-to-use live chat platform, you can deliver smooth, instant live chat customer service that improves experiences and strengthens relationships.

When you interact with customers outside your website — whether through newsletters or social media posts — make sure it’s not a one-way relationship. Share a direct link to your chat and make yourself accessible.

This link gives customers instant access to live chat support — whether they have questions, need help, or just want to learn more about your business. Confident, well-informed customers are happier customers, and live chat customer support makes that possible, one chat at a time.

Does LiveChat have a help desk?

LiveChat includes a help desk feature to streamline customer support. While LiveChat focuses on real-time communication through its live chat software, it also integrates seamlessly with tools like ticketing systems to handle customer inquiries that require follow-up.

Using LiveChat’s help desk capabilities, you can:

Convert missed chats into tickets for later resolution.
Manage customer inquiries efficiently with a centralized ticketing system.
Combine live chat support services with email and other communication channels for a comprehensive support solution.

This integration ensures that no customer query is overlooked, providing a perfect balance between instant live chat for business and detailed follow-up support through the help desk system.

Does LiveChat have a Partner program?

Yes, LiveChat offers a Partner Program. The LiveChat Partner Program is an opportunity to earn while helping you transform your customer service. As a partner, you can promote the best live chat software and earn commissions for every referred customer.

LiveChat offers one of the highest-paying programs. You can choose the program that suits you best: promote, earn, and grow; become a solution provider by creating licenses for your customers; or develop new solutions for our customer base and monetize your innovations.

Does LiveChat offer an API?

Yes, LiveChat offers a powerful API that allows you to integrate LiveChat into your existing systems and create custom solutions. With the LiveChat API, you can automate workflows, access chat data, and customize the chat widget and live chat software features to match your brand and functionality needs.

It’s ideal for businesses building advanced features or connecting LiveChat with CRM systems, help desks, and other software. It offers flexibility and scalability, making it a great choice for businesses of all sizes. You can find more details and documentation on how to implement the API on the LiveChat API page.

Does LiveChat offer a chatbot?

Yes, LiveChat offers a seamless ChatBot integration that enhances customer support and automates interactions. ChatBot helps you manage common inquiries and provide instant responses, even when agents aren’t available.

Key features of the LiveChat and ChatBot integration include automating responses to frequently asked questions, integrating with live agents when the chatbot can't handle a query, lead generation to capture leads, and qualify them for follow-up.

With LiveChat and ChatBot, you can offer 24/7 assistance while keeping the human touch when needed.

What AI-based features does LiveChat offer?

LiveChat leverages AI-powered customer service to elevate the support experience.

It offers a range of AI-based features that enhance customer service beyond just chatbots. It includes AI customer service tools like our AI assistant Copilot, chat summaries, tag suggestions, and AI insights. These features, powered by artificial intelligence, streamline workflows and improve the overall customer experience while still leaving room for human support when needed.

Does LiveChat offer integrations?

Yes, LiveChat offers a wide range of integrations through the LiveChat Marketplace. LiveChat integrations enhance your workflow and connect with the tools you already use. Whether you need CRM, ecommerce, help desk, or marketing tools, LiveChat seamlessly integrates with popular platforms like WordPress, Shopify, Mailchimp, and more. With LiveChat’s integrations, you can customize your setup to meet your business needs and build a truly tailored solution to support your business growth.
