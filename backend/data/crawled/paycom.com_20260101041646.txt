Instead of hunting for the info you need, simply ask IWant. Our AI engine searches employee profiles and management dashboards to deliver instant answers. And because it pulls from data employees entered themselves, the results are reliable, real-time and comprehensive every time — all at your command. Before you navigate, ask IWant. Just Ask Automated Payroll You will stress less when employees do their own payroll Because no one knows their pay better than employees. Beti ® takes payroll off your plate by automatically building it and empowering employees to find and fix errors before it’s run — so it’s always right. Hours? Expenses? Deductions? All pulled live. Beti cut time spent on payroll by 90% . * You simply sit back and monitor the progress. Automate Payroll *A commissioned Total Economic Impact™ study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Paycom, June 2023. Results are for a composite organization representative of interviewed clients. Truly Single Database You can’t truly automate without a truly single database Automation relies on a seamless flow of data, which is only possible in a single database. Other software might claim to be all-in-one but is a patchwork of multiple systems masquerading as a single solution. Paycom is the only truly single database in the industry. See for yourself No chasing down data Looking for employee data? Simply ask and Paycom’s command-driven AI engine delivers it instantly and accurately. No app hopping User experience matters — you won’t get ping-ponged between different interfaces requiring multiple logins. No data reentry That’s right. Data changes made in one tool populate throughout the entire software. No security weak points We keep all data safe in one place — because more apps mean more data risk. See for yourself “Paycom is the most top-to-bottom, front-to-back, automated software on the market.” Steve Boese HR Technology Conference program co-chair Automated Time-off Decisions You don’t have to drown in decision fatigue Decisions, decisions.
