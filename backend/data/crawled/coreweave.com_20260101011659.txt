We also value their flexibility in tailoring solutions to our unique requirements, enabling us to optimize performance and meet the demands of a rapidly evolving landscape.” Craig Falls , Head of Quant Research , Jane Street "CoreWeave has been one of our earliest and largest compute partners. CoreWeave has helped us build really large-scale computing clusters that led to the creation of some of the models that we’re best known for and helped us deliver these systems to customers at the scale that they need." Sam Altman , CEO , OpenAI “We worked hand-in-hand with members of CoreWeave’s team to build the training clusters for our AI models—like having an extension of our own team on the infrastructure side. The performance we’ve seen from our CoreWeave clusters has been great, especially in terms of reliability and stability, and it’s enabled us to continue to deliver cutting-edge models quickly.” ‍ Arthur Mensch , Founder and CEO , MistralAI “CoreWeave’s deployment architecture enables us to scale up extremely fast when there is more demand. We are able to serve requests 3x faster after migrating to CoreWeave, leading to a much better user experience while saving 75% in cloud costs. For the users, this means the generation speeds will never slow down, even when there is peak load.” Eren Doğan , CEO , NovelAI “Within 30 seconds of a user opening a link to the McDonald’s Odyssey space, they each had their own secure, unique, beautiful, high-resolution, 60 frames-per-second Unreal Engine-powered experience. This is only possible because of CoreWeave’s Kubernetes API and range of high-performance compute and storage options. To be clear — this is not possible on any other provider or platform we’ve seen or tried to date.” Bram Horton , Systems Architect , Odyssey Pioneering the possible CoreWeave and the Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team unite world-class racing with cutting-edge cloud computing.
