If you're a DataFast user, you can now enjoy much faster analytics. Guy Needham Staff Backend Engineer at Canva I've worked with quite a few different data stacks, and I truly don't think we could have shipped what we have without Tinybird. We have achieved in a few days what would have taken ages with any other tooling. Jarred Palmer VP of AI at Vercel Tinybird's event ingestion endpoint is game changing. Instead of using Kafka or SNS, just send analytics events over HTTP — at up to 1000 req/sec. Steven Tey Founder and CEO at Dub With Tinybird, we don't have to worry about scaling a ClickHouse database or managing ingestion and API layers. We just build and let Tinybird worry about it Zeno Rocha Co-Founder & CEO at Resend Tinybird is exactly what we need it to be: infrastructure and tooling to ship analytics features. It eliminated what would have otherwise been a complex infra project and allowed us to focus on building a great email platform. Javier Baena Head of Data Platform at Audiense Without Tinybird, we would have needed people to set up and maintain ClickHouse, people to manage the API layer, people to manage the ETLs. Tinybird has easily saved us from having to hire like 3 to 5 more engineers. Damian Grech Director of Engineering, Data Platform at FanDuel What really makes Tinybird stand out is the simplicity and elegance of the user experience. Ethan Brown Senior Data Engineer at Phantom Writing SQL against streaming data without having to set up a single piece of infrastructure, I haven't seen anyone do that besides Tinybird. The cherry on top is that you hit a button and you get an API. Matt Vagni CTO at Plain Building highly-performant, real‑time data infrastructure is Tinybird's core remit. They're very, very good at it. Choosing Tinybird let us focus on our core remit while they focused on theirs. It was a very natural fit. Marc González Director of Data at Factorial We've shipped 12 new user-facing dashboards in just a few months. There's no way we could have done this without Tinybird. Thomas Rausch Co-founder at LocalStack We had some audacious goals for our product which we thought were unattainable with our capacity at the time. Tinybird made it possible. Carl Thorner CTO & Co-Founder of Zembula The better the tooling is, the faster we can iterate, and that's critical to getting a good solution. Tinybird has the best support and the best tooling of any hosted ClickHouse solution. It's best in class. START NOW Skip the infra work.
