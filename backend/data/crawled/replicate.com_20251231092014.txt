But as you do more complex things, you can fine-tune models or deploy your own custom code. Run models Our community has already published thousands of models that are ready to use in production. You can run these with one line of code. Explore models import replicate output = replicate.run( "black-forest-labs/flux-dev" , input ={ "aspect_ratio" : "1:1" , "num_outputs" : 1 , "output_format" : "jpg" , "output_quality" : 80 , "prompt" : "An astronaut riding a rainbow unicorn, cinematic, dramatic" , } ) print (output) Fine-tune models with your own data You can improve models with your own data to create new models that are better suited to specific tasks. Image models like SDXL can generate images of a particular person, object, or style. Fine-tune image models Train a model: training = replicate.trainings.create( destination= "mattrothenberg/drone-art" version= "ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer:e440909d3512c31646ee2e0c7d6f6f4923224863a6a10c494606e79fb5844497" , input ={ "steps" : 1000 , "input_images" : https://example.com/images.zip , "trigger_word" : "TOK" , }, ) This will result in a new model: mattrothenberg / drone-art Fantastical images of drones on land and in the sky 0 runs mattrothenberg / drone-art Fantastical images of drones on land and in the sky 0 runs Then, you can run it with one line of code: output = replicate.run( "mattrothenberg/drone-art:abcde1234..." , input ={ "prompt" : "a photo of TOK forming a rainbow in the sky" }), ) Deploy custom models You aren’t limited to the models on Replicate: you can deploy your own custom models using Cog , our open-source tool for packaging machine learning models. Cog takes care of generating an API server and deploying it on a big cluster in the cloud. We scale up and down to handle demand, and you only pay for the compute that you use. Learn more First, define the environment your model runs in with cog.yaml: build: gpu: true system_packages: - "libgl1-mesa-glx" - "libglib2.0-0" python_version: "3.10" python_packages: - "torch==1.13.1" predict: "predict.py:Predictor" Next, define how predictions are run on your model with predict.py: from cog import BasePredictor, Input, Path import torch class Predictor ( BasePredictor ): def setup ( self ): """Load the model into memory to make running multiple predictions efficient""" self .model = torch.load( "./weights.pth" ) # The arguments and types the model takes as input def predict ( self, image: Path = Input(description= "Grayscale input image" ) ) -> Path: """Run a single prediction on the model""" processed_image = preprocess(image) output = self .model(processed_image) return postprocess(output) Scale on Replicate Thousands of businesses are building their AI products on Replicate. Your team can deploy an AI feature in a day and scale to millions of users, without having to be machine learning experts. Learn more about our enterprise plans Automatic scale If you get a ton of traffic, Replicate scales up automatically to handle the demand. If you don't get any traffic, we scale down to zero and don't charge you a thing.

You don't pay for expensive GPUs when you're not using them. Forget about infrastructure Deploying machine learning models at scale is hard. If you've tried, you know. API servers, weird dependencies, enormous model weights, CUDA, GPUs, batching. Prediction throughput (requests per second) Logging & monitoring Metrics let you keep an eye on how your models are performing, and logs let you zoom in on particular predictions to debug how your model is behaving.
