Meet some of the cybersecurity nerds securing your world
Pieter
Malware Intelligence Researcher

“I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to earn a living doing what I love most: helping people stay safe from scammers and cybercriminals.
Knowing that my work protects and educates readers about online dangers is the best reward of all.”

Uriya
Mobile Product Lead

“I’m passionate about making REAL people—friends, family, everyday users—safer online. Everyone deserves protection, and it should come in a way that’s simple, effective, and speaks their language. The best security is the kind people actually use and understand.”

Arpy
Senior Product Manager

“What makes me tick as a product person is the personal touch – treating our users like the rockstars they truly are! I’m a big believer in bringing a sprinkle of empathy and a dash of humor to every interaction. It’s not just about solving problems – it’s about having a blast while we do it!”

Ashley
Public Relations

“At the end of the day, my work is all about helping people—protecting their hard-earned money, securing their cherished family photos and videos, and ensuring they don;t fall victim to scams. I love making a real difference through empathy, compassion, and education, rather than by spreading fear or uncertainty.”

Russ
Information Security Analyst

“The minute I walked in the building for my first interview, I could feel something was different. Relaxed but serious. While I wasn’t entirely sure what was going on, I knew I wanted to be a part of it.”

Laura
VP, Global People

“When you see stats like 75% of the cybersecurity industry is male, you can’t help but ask why. Diverse voices will improve our industry, not hinder it. Women bring a different perspective to the table, and that can only be good for building cybersecurity products and services.”

Nilay
Site Reliability Engineer

“You can’t be excited to go back to work after a vacation unless you have colleagues you enjoy working with and learning from—people who are good at what they do and happy to share that with you. I’m grateful to have those people at Malwarebytes.”

Marcin
Founder and CEO

Marcin founded Malwarebytes in 2004 after accidentally downloading malware on his family computer. What began as a personal solution has grown into a global mission: protecting people everywhere from online threats.
