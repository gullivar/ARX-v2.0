This final stronghold is where the remaining few fight to survive, blessed with Gifts of power in exchange for their memories and a thirst for blood. Give into the bloodlust fully and risk becoming one of the Lost, fiendish ghouls devoid of any remaining humanity. Wandering aimlessly in search of blood, the Lost will stop at nothing to satisfy their hunger.

As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a surreptitious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. There are over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts — such as Juggernaut Maniac, Helo-Scout, Vulture and the ODIN Strike. You can even bring in Riley, from the single-player campaign, as your guard dog to warn you when enemies approach, and to attack enemies if they get too close to your person.

Kevin Spacey is Jonathan Irons — one of the most notorious men in the world — shaping this chilling vision of the future of war. The game unfolds in a plausible future in which technological, telesis and today’s military practices have converged with real world consequences. In this image of the future, Private Military Corporations have become the dominant armed forces for many countries who must outsource their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting international law. Irons, the founder and president of the world’s largest PMC, Atlas Corporation, is at the vortex of these tectonic plates. Suit up for combat in exoskeletons that advance every facet of a soldier’s battle readiness, enabling combatants to deploy with an advanced lethality and eliminating the need for specialization. Players tout enhanced player movement and verticality through boost jumps and grappling, covert cloaking abilities, and biomechanics that provide keen strength, awareness, endurance, and speed. With the advent of the exoskeleton and newly advanced armor and weaponry, every soldier commands tactical freedom in any terrain unlike ever before.
