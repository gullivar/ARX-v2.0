Are you a WARC Creative subscriber? Login to access the full report × Each year, WARC tracks the results of the top regional and global award shows for creativity and effectiveness for its WARC Rankings. Using the rankings data, we wanted to assess the health of creativity: how often is creative work also effective? We compared data from the rankings to see how many creative ideas were subsequently awarded for effectiveness, and if highly awarded campaigns were more likely to be effective. The research shows that 20% of all creatively awarded ideas are also awarded for effectiveness, and if an idea is highly awarded for creativity, it is more likely to be effective.

It’s my first port of call for ideas and information as the content is always backed up by data and examples. The WARC team are also always on hand and fantastically helpful.” JOSHUA ROBERTSON CMO, APAC, VCCP “WARC is a very inspiring think tank for me. I can find useful case studies, sharing and the latest trends to empower my strategic thinking. Also, the key account manager is very helpful and warm to give the prompt supports. In short, I would highly recommend WARC to people in marketing, advertising, and innovation industries” THOMAS WANG Senior Strategist, LEGO “WARC is a key source of insights for our marketing team. We use it to source best practice case studies from around the globe both within and outside of our category. It is great to see the detail behind the success of different campaigns and use these learnings in our own market.” SARAH LOYE Research Manager, Allied Irish Bank “I love how rigorous the case studies are. What stands out most is the take on ROI measurement and how the cases show real outcomes, results, and measurements. They are impressive because general publications simply do not go there. They don’t go down to ROI and the evidence behind why the campaign was effective. I find that more appealing because most of my clients are interested in learning about results and what it takes to get results.” SERAJ BHARWANI Chief Strategy Officer, Illumin “I always use WARC as a key resource in building a foundation of insights for any project I'm working on. I can always rely on reports, best practices or even data points to get me started in the right direction.” SIDNEY GALSTAD Lead & Growth Audiences, Schibsted ASA “Usually there is so much information to get through when starting our research, and WARC really helps find the key nuggets of information for us to move forward, without drowning in the research.” SHAYNI SHECTER Associate Strategist, Yum!
