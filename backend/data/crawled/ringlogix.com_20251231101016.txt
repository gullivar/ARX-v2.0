Richard Bruce President , Dimensional Communications "RingLogix really bases their success on my success. We have never experienced anything like this with another vendor or manufacturer. With Ring Logix, I can enter my own port request and almost every request has been fulfilled within 7-10 business days without any issues. It has been amazing. This was the first product and vendor that we felt really works." John Pettus Business Development, CIU Networks "RingLogix is a great VoIP solution that we use for our clients in many different industries. Setting up new accounts is a painless experience and we have more compatible hardware options versus our previous VoIP platform. Support is always there for us when we need it and the Support team always follows up. Ring Logix is our preferred VoIP solution." Brian Halbeisen CEO, RingGenius "RingLogix really gives us everything we need to operate. We looked at building our own network but but most of the VoIP switches and billing systems available just didn’t compare. Plus they needed tons of integrations and customizations to meet our needs. It was just too much. The fact that RingLogix just has EVERYTHING from service to features and quoting and billing. It really helps us focus on sales vs building and maintaining all those distractions." John Lettieri President, TeleData Services, LLC "Since signing up with RingLogix, I must say I am very happy and impressed. I have increased my net revenue by 50%. When I was signed up with third parties reselling their solution I was only generating 17%-18% commission. If you are looking to brand your own solution, increase revenue streams and work with a top notch support team; RingLogix is the company to choose." Armando Binelo CEO, Trust Technology Solutions "I used to resell other telecom solutions and would earn 15-20% maybe even 25% commissions. But it felt like we were the ones doing most of the work. Selling, supporting and with no access to troubleshoot or help. Now that I am offering my own branded telecom services with RingLogix, I earn 70% Gross Profit margins and I am doubling my revenue on my existing customer base." Control your offering. Increase your profits. Enjoy your growth. With a partner that is 100% channel focused and puts you in charge.
