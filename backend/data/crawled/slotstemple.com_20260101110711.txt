Check out the BeGambleAware site for the signs of problem gambling – if you think you are displaying any of these signs, it's time to stop. If you think you have a problem you should also visit the GamCare website – they offer excellent help and advice to those affected by problem gambling.

Gambling is for over 18s only – it is illegal for minors to gamble, as such this website is for over 18s only. If you are from the UK, you will have to go through an age verification process before accessing our free games, as per UKGC regulations.

We take responsible gaming very seriously at Slots Temple - take a took at the tips and tools listed below that can help you to gamble responsibly.

Discover the Slots Temple!

You, the lucky explorer, have just discovered the legendary Slots Temple. We've got over 2000 of Online Slots Real Money (via Pragmatic Play and others), 15,000 Free Slots on-site – picking the best games from the likes of NetEnt, Games Global, Pragmatic Play, Blueprint, Play'n GO and Inspired Gaming to ensure that you get an unrivalled mix of slots content.

We have the very best games such as Temple Tumble, Bonanza, Book of Dead, Big Bass Splash, Big Bass Bonanza and Fishin Frenzy. It's safe to say you won't find this incredible mix of games anywhere else on the web!

About Slots Temple

We offer three ways to play online slots here at Slots Temple: you can play online slots for real money, you can play slots in demo mode for free and you can play slots tournaments for free or real money. We are able to offer real-money gameplay as we have been granted a UKGC licence.

We want to offer players choice in how they play, and we want to give our customers the ability to play for free either via our tournaments or our demo games. We want to entertain, regardless of whether you have money to spend.

We hope the fact we are licenced offers reassurance to those of you who use the site that we are doing things correctly and take matters such as Safer Gambling exceptionally seriously.

Tournaments are available as a paid-for product - generally speaking, entries cost between 1p and £2. All the money earned from tournaments goes back into the free or paid-for prize pools.

Our RTP Guarantee

At Slots Temple, we have promised our customers that we will always offer the highest possible RTP (Return to Player) on our real money slots. It's our RTP Guarantee.

It is perhaps not a well-known fact by many online slot players that game studios offer the same game at different RTP levels. For example, Book of Dead is available at 96.21%, 94.25% and 91.25% - a big difference in player experience. This means that the Casino's margin on the top RTP is 3.79%, whereas it's a much bigger 8.75% on the lowest RTP. We offer the Book of Dead game at the top RTP at 96.21%.

We promise always to take the top RTP version of any game, giving ourselves the smallest margin and offering the player the best possible experience.

This doesn't mean you are guaranteed to win at Slots Temple (clearly, the margin/odds are still in our favour), but it does mean that we offer the best value on slots in the UK. 

Plenty of huge, well-known betting and casino brands in the UK choose lower RTP on their slots, so if you are playing elsewhere, please always check the RTP in the game paytable before you start playing so you understand if you are playing the best value version of the game.

Always Play Safely

If you do decide to gamble for real money, you should be aware that gambling is risky and can be addictive, so read BeGambleAware.org before playing for real money. We want to ensure that you play responsibly, so here are some tips to keep in mind before you gamble for real money:

Tip	Description
Set a budget	No matter what type of online casino game you choose to play, you should always have a predetermined bankroll. This is a certain amount of money that you are willing to part with when playing your favourite online slots.
Track your spending	As is the case with any expenditure in your life, you should always keep track of how much money you spend while playing slots online. Whether you have a budget app or you simply keep a spreadsheet of your spending, make sure that you include what you spend on casino games.
Set a reality check timeframe	It is easy to get caught up playing any online game, so it may be a good idea to set a reality check. You can do that on this site using our Player Protection tools or at any UKGC licenced Casino. Once you've selected your reality check time frame (for example 20 minutes) you'll get a pop-up at every 20 minutes to ask if you want to continue playing.
Don't chase losses	This is good advice for all online casino players. Once you hit your budget, then stop playing. Your budget should be set in such a way that you won't mind losing whatever you have set aside. Playing slots online should always be a fun experience, and it's essential that you stop playing when you stop having fun.
Slots Temple Tournaments

Slots Temple Tournaments allows users to register an account and compete against other Slots Temple players on our Tournament leaderboards. 

In July 2022 we went live with a UKGC licenced version of our tournament product. This enables us to offer real money prizes in our tournaments. In Slots Temple Tournaments, you can play top slots from Relax Gaming, Push Gaming and Pragmatic Play, including Money Train 2, Money Train 3, Temple Tumble, Razor Ways and Big Bass Bonanza.

We want to hear your feedback, so please create an account, start playing and tell us what you think.

Real Money Online Slots

We have recently launched Real Money Online Slots - these are slots that you can play for real money right here at Slots Temple. We will be adding more games over the coming months. We restrict bet levels to lower levels than other online casinos.

No Deposit Slots

Here at Slots Temple, if you don't want to play for real money you can choose to play slots for free. Just click on a game image, and you will be taken to a page where you can choose to spin its reels using play-money credits. 

High Volatility Or Low Volatility Slots? What are Payout Percentages?

What's the RTP (return to player)? Is it a volatile Slot? How many bonus features are there?

All these questions can be answered by spending 15 minutes spinning the reels on any of the free slots on our site (a very sensible thing to do before playing with real money). We also provide accurate information on each game on the site. 

About Volatility

If you want to know a bit more about slot volatility, we have some information for you right here. You can make an estimate about whether or not your chosen slot will pay out frequently and if it will pay out smaller or larger prizes based on its volatility.

High volatility slots award infrequent, big wins. More frequent smaller wins, come from low volatility slots.

The best part is that you can play high and lower-risk games without ever having to worry about your bankroll.

Since Slots Temple offers you the chance to play free online slots, you can try out both low and high-volatility games to find out which one best suits your budget and your gaming preferences.

About RTP

Another relevant term to look out for is "return to player" or RTP.

This number refers to the amount of money that is paid out as prizes for every £100 wagered. In the online slots market, RTPs generally range from around 92% to 98%, obviously the higher %, the better for the player, so if this is an essential factor for you always check the RTP (payout) before playing for real money.

The critical thing to remember is that over time, despite winning sessions for players, the house always wins. You won't find slots that have RTPs of 105% (unfortunately)!

User-Rated, So You Can Choose To Play The Best Slots Around

Whenever you play games at Slots Temple, you'll be able to provide a rating. Based on each game's score, you should be able to decide which games are perfect for you.

While you might choose to pass over playing a 1-star online slot, there are sure to be hundreds of other 5-star games available that will tickle your fancy!

If you are from the USA, then please check out of US Free Slots page, with games specially selected for our North American audience.

Popularised by games like Money Train, hold-and-win slots have a unique bonus round where only paying symbols and blank spaces are present. You begin the round with 3 'lives' and every spin that results in a winning symbol appears resets the lives. Once you gave no lives left, the round ends and your total winnings are based on the sum of the paying symbols. 
 
Slots On All Platforms

With slot games now available on every platform, from Windows to Macs on desktop and Android and iOS iPhones on mobile and iPads and beyond for tablets there really is no reason not to play Slots for free (as long as you are over 18 and thoroughly versed in the risks of gambling).

Whether you are someone who simply likes to navigate around the site playing old favourites and testing out the latest Slot releases or if you are a real-money Slots player who wants to test slots in a safe environment, to give a better understanding of the game, then Slots Temple is the place to play.

When playing mobile slots, ensure that your device has:

Enough RAM. Most smartphones are equipped with 8GB + these days which is enough to run most mobile games - this has become less of an issue as smartphones have advanced.
 
Plenty of battery life. Playing mobile games can really drain your battery, and you don't want to play slots online to leave you without a functional phone. Most of the newest smartphones have a battery life of more than 10 hours, but this is reduced when your screen is on.

You should look for a phone with a battery that supports about 4 to 5 hours of screen time. This will allow you time to play your favourite slots online while you're out and about.
 
An updated operating system. If you have had your phone for a couple of years, you should ensure that it has the latest operating system. This means that your device will be updated with the software that is necessary to play your favourite online slots while on the go. 
 
A quality screen. It is vital that you're able to fully experience the online slots that you're playing, which means having a good display on your device. With any screen that is smaller than 5.5 inches, you may struggle to really appreciate all of the hard work that slots developers put into their designs.

When it comes to resolution, 720x1280 is the most common around the world – so, be sure that your phone features something similar. However, mobile slot games run on HTML5, which means they should be able to resize to fit any screen for high-quality visuals.

Slots Temple FAQs
Can I Play Slots Online For Real Money?

Absolutely; if you are over 18 and can pass an ID verification, you can play Real Money Slots here at Slots Temple. We have recently gone live with a selection of real money slots that you can play here, if you don't want to play here we also list other UKGC-licenced casinos on our casino and bonus pages.

Can You Really Win Playing Online Slots?

Of course! While the casino has an edge, there is always a chance to win real-money prizes. Just be aware that there are no guarantees that you'll win while playing casino games, and you should always bet responsibly.

Can You Cheat Online Slots?

Online casinos are incredibly well-regulated in the UK, and there is no way to cheat at online slots or increase your chances of winning. All games must be approved by the Gambling Commission.

Where Can I Play Play Online Slots?

Here at Slots Temple we have both real-money online slots and free slots available to play. We are licenced by the UKGC, so we can offer a real-money product in the UK.

Which Online Slots Payout The Most?

Here at Slots Temple we list the payout rates of the slots we feature on our site. Generally anything above 96% is a good RTP (return to player) but you can find slots that pay out up to 98%. The secret is to do your research before you play.

At Slots Temple we have an RTP Guarantee - meaning that if a game has variable RTP option we always use the highest RTP (the best option)

Are Online Slots Are Safe / Legit?

If you are playing with a trusted Slots maker like NetEnt, IGT or Playtech then the answer is these are going to be safe slots – these are established companies with reputations up uphold – they have made quality commitments to their customers. Also, if you are playing in a country that has a regulated and legalised marketplace at a Casino that has been approved by the regulator then the games you play will have been tested for fairness, so you should be okay.

Of course, safety is a subjective term, if you ever feel yourself getting out of control while gambling or chasing losses then you might consider it unsafe to play online slots – this would be a correct assumption and you should get in touch with GamCare and self-exclude yourself from any online casinos you are a member of.

Which Online Slots Are The Best?

This is a very subjective question and one that you can only really answer yourself. Some people like the thrill of a highly volatile slot that might only bring they a big win every 500 spins. Others like lots of little wins. Some will prefer a certain software developer while others will go for a particular theme like Ancient Egypt.

The best thing to do is try lots of games for free and find what you like before playing for real.

How Do Online Slots Work?

Every online slot game that you play contains something called a Random Number Generator (RNG). This clever piece of kit creates random sequences continuously (1000s per second) – so every time you hit spin on your slot the RNGs creates a random and different series of numbers. So, no matter how different looking a slot game is, whatever the theme the RNG is the common thread that drives the games.

The outcome that appears on your slot game because of the RNG’s work will be quickly calculated (adding up wins on lines) to give you your result – either a win or a loss.

How Do You Win Playing Online Slots?

The plain fact is that the odds are against you, as there is always a house edge. The best thing you can do is be prepared, stick to your budget, understand the gameplay and know when to walk away.

Are Online Slots Rigged?

Echoing answers above, if you are playing at trusted, regulated casinos in a legalised part of the world (such as the UK where the UKGC regulate the online gambling industry) you are not going to have problem with rigged slots – none of the big slots software providers that supply games to trusted casinos have rigged games. Each game is rigorously tested before being allowed into the market. It’s not in these massive multi-national companies interests to produce rigged games – the damage to their reputation would be impossible to come back from.

In unregulated gambling territories, you will occasionally see very dodgy setups with counterfeit games at dubious casinos – generally, you can spot these a mile off, but if you have any doubts, make sure you do your research around game/game reviews before committing.

Are Online Slots Legal?

The answer to this question depends on where you live. Many countries (like the UK) are 100% regulated and rigorously policed by the government or government agency, and you can legally play slots online. The best thing to do is research and make the call based on your residence.

Are Online Slots Fair?

They may often see unfair when you are on a losing streak and the expected return to play you’ve received is way below the stated payout on the game but if you are playing with a trusted provider like Games Global or WMS or any of the software companies list on this site you know the game has been tested for fairness and the payout stated in the paytable is accurate.

Are Online Slots Really Random?

It may not seem like slots are random when you spin for the 20th time in a row without a win, but all slots contain an RNG (see above) that does make every spin random. This is tested by compliance officials before the game can be released into regulated markets.

Can You Play Online Slots Like The One's In Vegas/Macau/Monaco Land-based Casinos?

Yes! The world of offline slots and online slots grows closer by the day – not only do big, classic titles from Vegas like Cleopatra come to the online world, but we are starting to see traffic go the other way too – online games that have been very successful are now popping up in land-based environments. We have some games tagged up as ‘Vegas’-themed on the site – look at these and you might spot some of your favourites.

Are there Real Online Slots For Android/iPhone/Mobile?

Absolutely! All online slots today are created using HTML5 which means they work directly within your web browser without the need to download any software.

Please Play Responsibly. Strictly 18+. Underage gambling is an offence.
