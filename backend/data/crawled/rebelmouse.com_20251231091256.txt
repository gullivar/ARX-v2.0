Talk to us Real Feedback From Real Rebels We continue to be huge fans of RebelMouse and envision a very long-term relationship with the platform. The service has been impeccable. Douglas Fischer Executive Director We're in a much better position to make it through the current crisis in part due to RebelMouse and their platform. We've not only saved on overhead costs, we've more easily optimized our traffic with their smart measuring and SEO tools, as well as their social integrations. Jill Braff President/CEO Before RebelBoost, we struggled with Core Web Vitals. We tested third-party solutions that improved PageSpeed Insights scores dramatically, but revenue metrics dropped in the split test. RebelBoost took a different approach and achieved green Core Web Vitals scores for Bored Panda without compromising our monetization performance. The RebelBoost team brought a level of expertise and hands-on collaboration that really stood out. Lukas Visockas Chief Innovation Officer We had a vision, and the team realized it for us. They genuinely listened, did not push their solutions, but worked with us to get where we needed to be. There is not better feeling than waking up in the morning and seeing a design and product look exactly as you envisioned. If not better. Kelley Vlahos Senior Advisor and Editorial Director So inspired and impressed by these results from RebelMouse. Check them out and ask Andrea Berry how they got there! Just goes to show that spending millions doesn't necessarily get you to the right destination. It's spending no more than you need on the right technology with the right platform that does! Andrey Lipattsev Partner Development Manager Technical SEO seemed like an enigma we couldn't decipher, but after we started working with Craig and the RebelMouse team , everything clicked into place: Thanks to their in-depth audits and insights, we’re now able to optimize our site and content to successfully boost our search referrals. SEO secrets unlocked! Erico Guizzo Digital Innovation Director, IEEE Spectrum RebelMouse brings the strengths of a large publisher (large datasets, expertise, lessons learned from trial and error, close relationships with search and ad platforms) to smaller publishers. During the build and launch, the team went above and beyond to ensure we were happy with the new site, and they flawlessly migrated over 20,000 articles. I can't recommend them highly enough. Ryan Koo CEO RebelMouse's Blueprints framework was an incredible tool for us to transition the look and feel of our site without hundreds of hours of back-and-forth. We found the transition easy to navigate and the world-class customer service of RebelMouse made the process seamless and efficient -- both of which are essential for small publishers like us. Luke Viertel Director of Digital Partnerships What we love about working with the RebelMouse team is that we can brainstorm new ideas together and see the results appear faster across AI channels than traditional SEO was ever able to deliver. Having RebelMouse experts in content optimization on the team is a huge competitive advantage for us.
