Companies with the highest customer satisfaction scores return double the shareholder value and 3x higher growth than their peers. (Deloitte) Increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by as much as 95% , but 1 in 3 consumers say they would stop doing business with a brand they loved after one bad experience. (PWC: Experience is everything. Get it right.) Companies that lead with employee experience develop more successful innovations, see twice the revenue growth and have Net Promoter Scores (NPS) that are 2x as high as their peers. (Invesp) The payouts for valued, great experiences are tangible: up to a 16% price premium on products and services , plus increased loyalty.
