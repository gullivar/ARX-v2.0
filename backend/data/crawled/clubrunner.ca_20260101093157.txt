Things that used to be difficult are now easy. The customization that is now possible makes it possible to have a very attractive website without the expense of a web designer. I see clubs that make the mistake of wanting a great looking website, but they don’t realize that it is the constant input of content that makes for visits to a club website. James D. Rancho Bernardo Sunrise Rotary Club ClubRunner is affordable and geared toward people who want to improve club communications at an affordable cost. The best part is the support. No one at ClubRunner makes you feel that a question is foolish, and they even solve problems for you if they can. We are truly “leading the way” in creating a more informed club. Mary C.
