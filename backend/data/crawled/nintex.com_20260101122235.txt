Verified Reviewer | 501-1000 employees Frequently Asked Questions Nintex platforms and capabilities Explore the details of how Nintex works and what it can do for your teams. What is Nintex? Nintex is a process automation platform that helps businesses eliminate manual work and streamline workflows. Instead of spending hours on repetitive tasks like approvals, routing, or data entry, teams can automate those tasks and shift their focus to high-impact work. That leads to faster execution, fewer errors, and more time for strategic priorities. The outcome is a more efficient, effective team across every department. How does Nintex AI work? Nintex AI uses machine learning to make your workflow automations smarter over time. It identifies patterns in your processes, flags inefficiencies, and suggests ways to improve performance. This helps your team make better decisions and keep operations running smoothly, even as complexity grows. Can Nintex be integrated with other systems? Yes, Nintex connects with a wide range of systems, both in the cloud and on-premises. Whether you use Microsoft 365, Salesforce, SAP, or something custom, Nintex works with your existing tools to create a seamless flow of data. That means you can reduce manual entry, avoid duplicate work, and give every team access to the information they need without jumping between platforms. What types of workflows can I automate with Nintex? Nintex can automate everyday workflows across departments. That includes employee onboarding in HR, purchase requests in finance, case management in customer service, and more. By automating these processes, you speed up delivery times, reduce manual follow-ups, and ensure work moves forward without delays or confusion. The result is more consistent workflows, less manual effort, and fewer delays caused by disconnected systems. Is Nintex an Agentic Business Orchestration platform? Yes. Nintex is an Agentic Business Orchestration platform, which means it uses AI to coordinate people, systems, and agents so organizations can achieve clear, measurable outcomes. Instead of automation just taking on tasks, Nintex transforms how work gets executed — turning workflows into governed solutions that are faster to build, smarter to manage, and designed to cut through silos.
