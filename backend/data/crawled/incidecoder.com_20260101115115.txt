I love this site primarily because it’s the opposite of the ones I avoid or hate. It’s clean, organized, supported by research (they include their sources without asking you to trust them blindly), and free of judgment It lists all of the ingredients and then breaks them down, describing if they’re good for your skin, what it is, exactly, they do and the irritancy qualities of each ingredient. Better than COSDna for comprehensive ingredients list AND easier to read - in layman's terms too.
