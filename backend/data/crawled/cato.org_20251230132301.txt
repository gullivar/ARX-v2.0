Fiscal Democracy in America: How a Balanced Budget Amendment Can Restore Sound Governance

As America’s debt climbs and the danger of a fiscal crisis grows, is it time to add a constitutional guardrail? In Fiscal Democracy in America, Kurt Couchman proposes a principles-based balanced budget amendment (BBA) to address the persistent deficits in Washington in a flexible and politically feasible manner. Marc Goldwein draws on his experience in fiscal commissions and provides a challenge to the BBA as a silver-bullet solution to America’s fiscal crisis.

Winter 2025

The main goal of drug prohibition—to reduce problematic drug consumption—can be achieved without prohibition, and without the negative consequences that drug bans bring. Drug control through nudge-based relegalization offers a rare opportunity to reduce coercion and harm simultaneously.

Unintended Consequences

Unintended Consequences is the podcast of Regulation magazine, produced by the Cato Institute. Hosted by Peter Van Doren and Paul Matzko, the show explores how government interventions can have surprising—and often negative—consequences. Drawing from Regulation’s in-depth policy analysis and cover stories, each episode unpacks the gap between policymakers’ intentions and the real-world outcomes that follow.
