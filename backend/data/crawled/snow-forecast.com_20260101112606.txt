We chose Champagny en Vanoise, staying at Club Alpina, as our starting point for the first week and then went to Les Deux Alps for the second week. What a difference! Champagny was relatively quiet and delightful whereas Les Deux Alps was crowded and rowdy with pushy snowboarders rushing past as if they owned the slopes. So, therefore we're going back to Champagny this coming January, 2026, and now staying both weeks there. We're looking forward to it very much. Just loved the place. Hope it hasn't changed.” Hjalmar from UNITED KINGDOM - 29 Dec 2025 Read 4 more review(s) of Champagny or submit your own Whistler Blackcomb ski resort: “I have a season's pass to Whistler and I have a love/hate relationship with the mountain. Lately, the lift lines are out of control and you wait 5 hours to ski 3 runs. It's not worth going on a Fri/Sat/Sun. Any powder gets skiied out within 1-2 hours. You need to have the flexibility to go mid-week or don't even bother. They clearly need to limit the number of daypasses sold because the mountain is a complete gong show and not worth the time, energy or money to get there unless you can ski Tue-Thurs (although, even those days are very busy with good conditions). Fri-Mon are unbearable.” Ryan G from CANADA - 29 Dec 2025 Read 214 more review(s) of Whistler Blackcomb or submit your own Whistler Blackcomb ski resort: “The mountain is always great and stunning. However, this is our 4th and final visit ever because of the clear cost savings on grooming runs, opening runs especially for the beginners is at best terrible on this 2025 Christmas visit. Together with no staff on the over crowded lift line S…Show! Will definitely be spreading the word back in Australia for people not to pay overs for the worst maintained Canadian ski resort! Its like Thredbo on steroids meaning nothing being spent on guest services. A complete S….. show do not waste your money coming here, a real shame as it was a great place!” Michael from AUSTRALIA - 27 Dec 2025 Read 214 more review(s) of Whistler Blackcomb or submit your own Česky Deutsch Ελληνικά English Español Français Italiano 日本語 Nederlands Português Русский Svenska Türkçe Explore Ski Resorts Weather Maps Snow Overview Whiteroom News Photos MySnow Services Membership Email Snow Alerts Mobile Snow App Eyeball Reporters Weather Feeds Social Facebook Instagram TikTok YouTube Forecast Every Adventure Advertising Support Contact Us Linking to Us Feedback © 2026 Meteo365 Ltd.
