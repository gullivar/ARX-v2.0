Why Ludwig is different

Most AI tools just generate text. Ludwig shows you how to write better.

Long text & short text modes

From quick edits to full manuscripts, Ludwig adapts to you

Writing a 200-page dissertation isn't the same as polishing a quick email. Switch between long text mode for deep work and short text mode for fast edits—Ludwig adapts to your task, not the other way around.

Start writing

AI suggests, you decide

Make deep edits without losing control

Get AI help with complex edits—restructuring paragraphs, adding citations, strengthening arguments. Every change is a suggestion you preview and approve, not an automatic replacement.

Start editing

Edit where you write

Polish every sentence without breaking your flow

Click any sentence to improve it. Use inline commands to rephrase, expand, or fix tone without leaving your document. No copy-paste workflows. No context switching. Just seamless editing.

Polish your writing

Chat with your documents

Stop switching between files. Start asking questions.

Turn your documents into a searchable knowledge base. Upload PDFs and spreadsheets, then ask Ludwig to find insights, extract data, or cite sources as you write. Research and writing, unified.

Know what's human, what's AI

You won't find this anywhere else

The app service is practical and very intuitive. It has greatly helped me during the writing of my scientific articles and even long my phD thesis. Thanks to Ludwig, I fixed some style mistakes, and it provided me with several good suggestions. I recommend it!
