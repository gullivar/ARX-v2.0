ABOUT

KUVO’s mission is to support electronic music creators.
Our aim is to collaborate with our partners to consistently deliver reliable and transparent data, enable innovation, and drive the electronic music industry forward.

KUVO ECOSYSTEM

KUVO supports music creators by empowering the industry with reliable data. Delivering valuable insights to venues and reliable reporting to CMOs, it enables more accurate royalty payments to creators. KUVO uses technology that works discreetly in the background to automate music play reporting for royalty purposes. It captures only the track data, which is never shared publicly, and no details of which DJ played which tracks.

HOW KUVO WORKS

The electronic music industry ecosystem – which generates royalties for music creators when DJs play their tracks – is built from a deeply interdependent framework of people and companies. This diagram outlines the flow of music, rights, and royalties for club and DJ events.

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

We at AlphaTheta Corporation are committed to supporting the creators of electronic music via the evolution of the KUVO service with our Pioneer DJ brand.

We recognize that music creators (producers, recording artists, songwriters, composers, and producer/DJs) are the lifeblood of the electronic music ecosystem. However, since the dawn of DJ culture, collecting accurate information on the music being played in clubs and electronic music venues has been challenging. Without accurate information on what is actually played, fewer electronic music creators receive royalty income.

AlphaTheta, through its Pioneer DJ brand, is uniquely positioned to make a difference and we recognize our cultural responsibility to do so.

Through our evolved KUVO service, we intend to create a balanced offering which incentivizes venues and events to engage with and deploy our data collection/performance reporting solutions, and to offer CMOs the most accurate, reliable, affordable, and “friction-free” reporting on a global scale to enable accurate royalty distributions to the creators and rightsholders of the music that DJs play.

The system enables DJs to support the creators of the music they play without needing to do anything more than play their tracks. No action from DJs is required for KUVO to function – it captures only the track data of the music played. The data is never shared publicly and does not include details of the performing DJ.

KUVO is a positive, creator-supporting initiative which provides insights and benefits for venues that participate, and it creates no negative impact or inconvenience for DJs.

For transparency on how KUVO will generate income to sustain itself: the proposed model involves charging selected industry partners for data enhancement, music play insights, and analytics services. To clarify: no charges for KUVO services are incurred by venues, music creators, or DJs (currently, no KUVO services are provided for DJs).

SERVICES

KUVO is built to deliver valuable music insights and incentives to enhance venue businesses and provide CMOs with an opportunity to better support the creators and rightsholders of the music DJs play. Importantly, it also respects DJ setlist privacy – no playlists are publicized, and no details of which DJ played which tracks are captured.

KUVO For Venues

Venues can privately access trend and summary information on music played, receive exclusive benefits on Pioneer DJ and AlphaTheta equipment, and enable the industry to make more accurate payments of royalties to creators.

KUVO For CMOs

KUVO provides accurate, reliable, and secure music play data which can enable CMOs to distribute royalties more accurately to the creators and rightsholders of the music DJs play. We’re also developing “dual technology” solutions which bring together Music Recognition Technology (MRT) – through our partnership with DJ Monitor – and KUVO’s Direct Metadata Collection (DMC) technology.
