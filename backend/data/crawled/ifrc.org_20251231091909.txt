Philippines: Earthquake and Typhoons

The Philippine province of Cebu was still reeling from the devastation of a magnitude 6.9 earthquake, when it was struck by a powerful Tyhpoon Kalmaegi (known locally as Tino) along with eight other nearby provinces. Since that time, Super Typhoon Fungwong (local name Uwan), also passed over the country, leaving a trail of devastation.  This revised emergency appeal expands the earlier Cebu Earthquake emergency operation from a single-province, earthquake-focused response to a multiple-province, multi-hazard intervention addressing the combined impacts of the earthquake, the recent storms, and typhoons still expected in this season. The scale-up prioritises integrated assistance – shelter and livelihoods, health, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene – to address rapidly rising needs among displaced populations and hardest-hit communities. Reflecting this significant scale-up, the overall funding requirement has increased from CHF 8 million to CHF 18 million. The target number of families to be assisted has also expanded from 14,588 to 56,981.
