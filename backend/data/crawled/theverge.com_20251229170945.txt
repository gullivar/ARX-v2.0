You can download Andromeda OS, the cancelled Windows for Surface Duo.

When Microsoft was first developing the Surface Duo, it was originally intended to run a Windows 10-based OS code-named Andromeda that looked a lot like Windows Phone. Of course, the company ended up canning those plans, opting to make the Duo Android-based instead. But you can now get your hands on an unstable build of Andromeda and see what might have been.

The engineer behind the arrow that tells you what side your fuel tank is on has died.

James Moylan passed away on December 11th at the age of 80. Moylan spent 34 years at Ford, where, according to Jalopnik, he came up with the “Moylan Arrow” in April 1986. The tiny arrow that helps you avoid pulling up on the wrong side of the fuel pump is so simple that it seems like it could have been there from the start, but it actually made its debut on the 1989 Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer.

NY Governor Kathy Hochul signs warning labels for ‘addictive social media’ into law.

In June, the New York state legislature passed a bill requiring social media companies to display warnings about the potential mental health harms of using their products. Now the governor has officially signed the bill into law. The announcement of the signing says that:

To combat the mental health risks of using harmful features of social media platforms that prolong use, this legislation will require social media companies to display warning labels on their platforms when a young user initially uses the predatory feature and periodically thereafter, based on continued use.

Billionaires are making empty threats to leave California if they’re asked to hoard slightly less money.

There’s a proposal making the rounds in California to levy a 5 percent wealth tax on anyone worth more than $1 billion. The proposal isn’t guaranteed to make it to the ballot next year. Just like when Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York, lots of the ultra-wealthy are having a hissy fit. But it seems highly unlikely that Larry Page is going to take his $258 billion (more than the GDP of most countries) and leave his longtime home for the corn fields of Nebraska. The New York Times points out that:

The potential wealth tax is under debate as the income divide in the United States becomes increasingly stark. Recent data from the Congressional Budget Office showed that income inequality increased over a 33-year period ending in 2022, with the share of wealth held by families in the top 10 percent at around 69 percent, while the share held by families in the bottom 50 percent at just 3 percent.

It took a phone ban for some teachers to realize kids don’t know how to read a clock.

Just like writing cursive, it seems that reading an old-school analog clock is the sort of skill that has fallen by the wayside in our smartphone age. That lapse was revealed when NYC public schools instituted a smartphone ban. The education department says students are taught to read a clock in first and second grade, but if it’s not a skill they’re using regularly, it could atrophy. According to Gothamist:

Kris Perry, executive director of Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development, said it makes sense that teens who have grown up in a fully digital environment haven’t had to practice analog clock-reading. She said the question is whether the shift amounts to a “a cognitive downgrade or just a replacement.”

She noted that brain scans have shown that holding books and handwriting generally lead to more brain activity than reading and typing on screens.

JerryRigEverything bends the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold beyond its limits.

Samsung’s three-panel foldable phone won’t be officially available in the US until next year, but it’s already hit the YouTuber’s durability test table. Its thin frame (that’s different sizes across all three sections) doesn’t deal well with being bent the wrong way, even if Samsung’s hinge technology is pretty resilient, but... it didn’t explode.

Press play for a peek at the test results and a look at all three internal battery cells.

A comedian snatched up Trump Kennedy Center domains months ago.

Most of us have been rolling our eyes at the (likely illegally) renamed The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. But Toby Morton, a comedian who has written for Mad TV and South Park, saw the move coming and snatched up trumpkennedycenter.org and trumpkennedycenter.com a while back. Morton told the Washington Post:

“As soon as Trump began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year, I thought, ‘Yep, that name’s going on the building.’”

Instagram wants to win over teens... but it might not understand them.

A report from The Washington Post reveals Meta’s recent push to attract more teens to Instagram, which reportedly involved setting up a “living museum” inside its offices “to help employees internalize the lifestyles of their teenage targets:”

In at least one case it featured photos of top teen hangout places — a fast-food restaurant and a mall — and instructions on how to take wacky, teen-style selfies, according to photos of the exhibit.

Tesla is still figuring out how to make the Cybertruck’s massive windshield wiper work.

According to Not A Tesla App, one owner shared a service message saying there’s an Engineering Investigation ongoing, and some service staff have said a third revision of the wiper is in testing.

The extra-long blade apparently has issues with improper stowage at high speeds, contact issues that leave the windshield dirty, and problems spraying wiper fluid, even after a software update. Also, Bloomberg reports NHTSA is expanding its investigation into passenger-trapping Tesla door handles to include Model 3 vehicles, along with the Model Y.

Imran Ahmed obtains temporary restraining order against State Department sanctions.

The CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) is suing Trump administration officials after they targeted him for deportation from the US because of his online content moderation work.

On Thursday morning, he announced that US District Judge Vernon Broderick granted a TRO and preliminary injunction blocking his arrest or detainment. A hearing has been scheduled for Monday.

Imran Ahmed is suing Marco Rubio and other federal officials to fight their sanctions barring him from the US.

The Trump administration just sanctioned five people, including Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) founder Imran Ahmed, over their work in content moderation and anti-disinformation. On Wednesday he filed a lawsuit (pdf) to stop their “unconstitutional attempt to arrest and expel him.”

Ahmed:

My life’s work is to protect children from the dangers of unregulated social media and AI and fight the spread of antisemitism online. That mission has pitted me against big tech executives – and Elon Musk in particular – multiple times. I am proud to call the United States my home. My wife and daughter are American, and instead of spending Christmas with them, I am fighting to prevent my unlawful deportation from my home country.

Stranger Things fandom drama strikes one more time.

In an Elite Daily interview ahead of this week’s penultimate release, series star Gaten Matarazzo referenced the “Stonathan” pairing and said he liked the idea behind “Steddie” fanfics.

But saying the “Byler” shipping between Will and Mike, was “very funny. I see them as just very good friends,” seemingly went too far for some, with social media posts targeting the interviewer, and some even claiming it was a fake quote.

DOJ explains an Epstein hoax to PopBase and claims it has a million unreleased files.

The feds have spent the last day or so replying to @PopBase on X and sloppily redacting documents. Now it’s claiming “The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,” which could take weeks to release.

CNBC reports Nvidia isn’t buying all of Groq, which has inference AI tech that IBM’s CEO recently told us “looks like it’ll be 10x cheaper” than GPUs.

Nvidia’s getting a non-exclusive license, and members of the team, like Google TPU creator and Groq CEO Jonathan Ross, and former Autonomic CEO Sunny Madra.

Nvidia tests of Intel’s 18A chip manufacturing process “stopped moving forward.”

In the spring, Reuters broke the news that Nvidia and Broadcom were testing Intel’s 18A process for chip production, but in a profile today of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, the outlet now says Nvidia’s test has ended, regardless of their new $5 billion deal.

The report doesn’t say why, but in October, Intel CFO David Zinsner said 18A yields were “not where we need them to be to drive the appropriate level of margins,” and that it could be 2026 or 2027 before that changes.

Apple’s foldable gets Prossered.

It’s unclear if Jon Prosser — Apple rumor monger and target of that Cupertino lawsuit — has his own sources, or is just regurgitating as fact reporting already done by the likes of Mark Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo. Nevertheless, this video is a good summary of where rumors of the foldable iPhone have coalesced, less than a year before its supposed release.
