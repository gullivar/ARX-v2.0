 interest in business and technology, created a desire to build a better practice management system. He
 is extremely passionate about helping health care practices and says; “I can’t think of a more
 rewarding way to spend my time than providing a system that helps healthcare professionals do what
 they do best.” For fun, Damien enjoys travelling, mountain bike riding, taking on DIY projects that
 exceed his skill level(!), and going fishing with his daughter.
