1 Based on an internal analysis conducted in April, 2021, select ecobee customers in North America saved up to 23% on their heating and cooling costs. When you add up the average cost of electricity and natural gas used for heating and cooling ($1,091 USD/$1,490.52 CAD) and multiply it by 23% (Smart Thermostat Essential’s savings claim) you get savings of up to $250/$342 (USD/CAD) per year. Annual savings will vary based on your energy use and location.
