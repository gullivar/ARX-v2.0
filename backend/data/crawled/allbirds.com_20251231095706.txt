Please note that if you visit one of our stores, we may collect personal data from you and such data may be linked to information we also collect online or through email and other marketing campaigns. 3.

Transactional Purposes. Allbirds will process personal information to fulfill requests for products, Services or information, including to: Respond to questions, comments, and other requests; Provide access to certain features of the Services; Personalize product recommendations; Communicate with you about logistical matters, including product deliveries and shipping; Conduct internal research and development; Review and respond to requests for customer support; and, Allow you to register for online profiles or in-person/in-store events.

From time to time, Allbirds may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve Individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Services, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities. If you participate in a survey, the information given will be used along with that of other study participants. Direct Mail, Email and Outbound Telemarketing. Individuals who provide us with personal information, or whose personal information we obtain from third parties, may, as permitted by law, receive periodic emails, newsletters, mailings, text messages or phone calls from us with information on our or our business partners’ products and services or upcoming special offers/events that we believe may be of interest.

Anonymized and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services. Anonymized or aggregated information is not personal information, and is thus not subject to this Privacy Policy . Shared Content.

Cookies, Pixels, and Similar Technologies We (along with third parties that provide content, advertising or other functionality on our Services), may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our website, services, applications, messaging and tools, and to recognize you across devices. You can find more information about the individual cookies we use on our Websites and the purposes for which we use them at allbirds.com/pages/cookies. Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories: a. Operational. We may use Technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Services. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our websites, Services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of functions such as shopping carts, saved search or similar functions. Performance-Related. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Services, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, services or tools. Functionality-Related. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into the Service or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content. Advertising-Related. We may use first-party or third party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement. We may also use third parties to serve targeted advertisements to people similar to our customer base (e.g., by uploading a hashed customer list to Facebook Custom Audiences) or incorporating a pixel from the third-party on our Site. Even if you have disabled certain cookies, advertisements may still be displayed to you through these third-party channels. If you would like to opt-out of the Technologies we employ, you may do so by blocking, deleting or disabling them as your browser or device permits. See Section 6 for additional opt-out options. Please note that blocking, deleting, or disabling these Technologies will affect the functionality of our Services and may prevent you from being able to access certain features. 5. How We Share Your Information We share information collected through the Services with the following categories of parties: Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers. The types of service providers to whom we entrust personal information include service providers for: (i) order fulfillment and warehousing; (ii) web hosting, analytics and related services; (iii) payment processing, fraud protection, and credit risk reduction; (iv) customer service activities such as inquiries and shipping; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Services. Allbirds’ policy is to execute appropriate contracts with service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing personal information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements, and this Privacy Policy. Business Partners. Allbirds may share personal information with its business partners and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested. Allbirds may also provide personal information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Allbirds. Marketing. Allbirds may allow third party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities on our Services (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected personal information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with third party advertising partners. Advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other companies) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Allbirds related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising”. We may allow access to other data collected by the Service to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. Professional Advisors: We share personal data with our legal, financial, insurance and other advisors in connection with corporate transactions or in connection with the management of all or part of our business or operations.

We may access, preserve and disclose your personal information, other account information and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate: (i) to comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as, a court order or subpoena; (ii) to respond to your requests; (iii) to protect yours, ours or others’ rights, property or safety; (iv) to enforce Allbirds policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Allbirds; (vi) to comply with records retention policies; (vii) when we believe access, preservation, or disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (viii) if we, in good faith, believe that access, preservation, or disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order to allow them to identify users in connection with their investigation of unauthorized activities. Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, Allbirds will endeavor to direct the transferee to use personal information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such personal information was collected. Managing Your personal information / Changing Marketing Prefere nces We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. You have the right to object to and opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of your personal information. Where you have consented to Allbirds’ processing of your personal information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt-out to further processing by contacting privacy@allbirds.com.

You may review, update, or modify your account information at any time by logging into your Allbirds account. You may also deactivate or delete your Allbirds account by emailing privacy@allbirds.com. “Do Not Track.” Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not override these settings or options. However, in order to access certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Services, you may be required to provide us with certain information, including some types of personally identifying information. If you do not wish to provide such information through the Service or if you opt to utilize the aforementioned privacy features of your computer system or web browser, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Site. Cookies and Similar Technologies. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs may not be effective on mobile interfaces. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt-out of certain mobile advertisements via their device settings. The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp , www.youronlinechoices.eu/ or www.youradchoices.ca/, and www.aboutads.info/choices/. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link, and that link to this Privacy Policy, may have been directed to you based on anonymous nonpersonal information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction. Where permitted by applicable law, you may inquire as to whether Allbirds is processing personal information about you, request access to personal information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of your rights under data privacy laws that apply in the country where you live. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an email to privacy@allbirds.com or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive, seek rectification, or request erasure of personal information held about you by Allbirds. Please include your full name, email address associated with your account and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in accordance with local laws. Although Allbirds will use good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which Allbirds is unable to provide access, including but not limited to where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy, in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Allbirds will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information. 7. Security & Retention The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us and Allbirds is committed to handling such information carefully. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your personally identifiable information. We use secure socket layer technology to protect the security of your payment information and we encrypt your personally identifiable information when it is sent over the Internet. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. By using the Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Services or sending an email to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing. We retain personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws. When we are no longer required to retain your personal information as described above, we will destroy, erase, or de-identify it in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable law. Legal requirements, however, may require us to retain some or all of the personal information we hold for a period of time that is longer than that for which we might otherwise hold it. 8. Children’s Privacy Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. In addition, you are not permitted to use our Services if you do not meet the minimum age requirement applicable to our Services in your jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may alert us at privacy@allbirds.com. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in certain jurisdictions, such as EU member countries) we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible and terminate the child’s account unless we receive verifiable parental consent. 9.

Right to opt-out of certain sharing with third parties. You may be entitled to direct us to stop disclosing your personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.

Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND ALLBIRDS TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU AND ALLBIRDS CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND ALLBIRDS FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND ALLBIRDS AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ALLBIRDS AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AND ALLBIRDS EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING DISPUTES AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF EITHER PARTY’S CLAIMS. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW, IN SECTION 13(j), IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. Claims This Section Applies To. This Section 13 applies to all Claims between you and Allbirds. A “ Claim ” is any dispute, claim, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed in Section 13(c), below) between you and Allbirds, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, for which either party wishes to seek legal recourse and that arises from or relates to these Terms or the Platform, including any claims related to the use or operation of the Platform, the purchase of any products or services made available through the Platform, all privacy or data security claims, and all claims related to the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Section or any portion of it. Informal Dispute Resolution Before Arbitration. If you believe you have a Claim against Allbirds or if Allbirds believes it has a Claim against you, you and Allbirds will first attempt to resolve the Claim informally to try to resolve the Claim more quickly and reduce costs for both parties. You and Allbirds will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Claim for 45 days (“ Informal Resolution Period ”), from the day either party receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party that satisfies the requirements of this Section 13(b) (a “ Claimant Notice ”).  The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. The Informal Resolution Period may be extended by the parties’ mutual written agreement. You must send any Claimant Notice to Allbirds by certified mail, addressed to Allbirds, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1875 Mission St Ste 103, San Francisco, CA 94103 or by email to legal@allbirds.com . Allbirds will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to Allbirds. The party sending a Claimant Notice (the “ Claimant ”) will ensure it includes (i) the Claimant’s name, address, email address, and telephone number; (ii) a description of the nature of and basis for the Claim, including the date(s) on which the Claim arose and the facts on which the Claim is based; (iii) the specific relief sought; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the Claimant themselves (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Claimant Notice. No arbitration demand (“ Arbitration Demand ”) may be filed or proceed before a Claimant Notice is sent and the Informal Resolution Period has concluded. If you or Allbirds files an Arbitration Demand without complying with the requirements in this Section 13, including the requirement to wait for the Informal Resolution Period to conclude, the other party may seek relief from a court to enjoin such filing and for such other relief as the court deems proper. The prevailing party in any such action shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in seeking such relief. To facilitate the parties’ efforts to reach an efficient resolution of any Claim, t he applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled, and all deadlines associated with arbitration fees deferred, from the commencement of the Informal Dispute Resolution Process through the date when suit or arbitration may be filed under these Terms. Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions. Except for individual disputes that qualify for small claims court (provided that the small claims court does not permit class or similar representative actions or relief) and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property rights of you or Allbirds, including any disputes in which you or Allbirds seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of your or Allbirds’s intellectual property (“ IP Claims ”), all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property or intellectual property rights but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 13(b) must be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration rather than in court. Claims subject to binding arbitration include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of this arbitration provision or any portion of it. Binding Individual Arbitration . Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 13, any Claim may be resolved only through binding individual arbitration con ducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “ AAA ”), https://adr.org/ , according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., (“ FAA ”). If you are a “ Consumer ,” meaning that you only use the Platform for personal, family, or household purposes, the th en-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by these Terms (the “ Rules ”), will apply to Claims between you and Allbirds. If you are not a Consumer, the then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, as modified by these Terms, will apply to Claims between you and Allbirds. These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the maximum extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Claim and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. As allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are individual to you or Allbirds to satisfy one of our individual Claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). Arbitration Procedure and Location. You or Allbirds may initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period by filing an Arbitration Demand with AAA in accordance with the Rules. Instructions for filing a demand with AAA are available on the AAA website. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to Allbirds by certified mail addressed to Allbirds, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1875 Mission St Ste 103, San Francisco, CA 94103 or by email to legal@allbirds.com . Allbirds will send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or, if no physical address has been provided, by email using the contact information you have provided to Allbirds. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the English language. You and Allbirds both agree that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms. For Claims in which the Claimant seeks less than USD $10,000, the arbitrator will decide the matter based solely on written submissions, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For Claims in which the Claimant seeks USD $10,000 or more, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings will be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing to be necessary. If an in-person hearing is determined to be necessary, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules. The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve all Claims in arbitration. Unless you and Allbirds agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each Claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions. Any arbitration decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement. Arbitration Fees. Each party will be responsible for arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules and these Terms. Frivolous or Improper Claims. To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Claimant must pay all costs incurred by the defending party, including any attorney’s fees and arbitration fees, related to a Claim if an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument, (ii) the factual contentions for the Claim lacked evidentiary support when filed or were unlikely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation; or (iii) the Claim was filed in arbitration for any improper purpose, such as to harass the defending party, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution. Confidentiality . If you or Allbirds files a Claim in arbitration, you and Allbirds agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of any discovery in the arbitration. You and Allbirds agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration. Mass Disputes. If 25 or more Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar Claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered a “ Mass Dispute ” and the provisions of this Section 13(i) will apply to all such Claimant Notices. A Claimant Notice in a Mass Dispute may proceed to arbitration only as set forth below. Applicable Rules. Any Arbitration Demands based on these Claimant Notices filed in arbitration shall be subject to the AAA’s then-current Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by these Terms. Any disputes over whether an Arbitration Demand should be considered part of the Mass Dispute will be decided by the AAA as an administrative matter. The following procedures are intended to supplement the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, and to the extent the procedures conflict with those Rules, to supersede them. Initial Arbitrations. The parties shall identify an initial set of 20 Claimant Notices to proceed as Arbitration Demands in order to maximize efficiencies in the management, investigation, and arbitration of the remaining Claimant Notices in the Mass Dispute. The initial set shall be selected as follows. Counsel representing the Claimants in a Mass Dispute must notify the other party in writing (email will suffice) when all or substantially all Claimant Notices for the Mass Dispute have been provided. Counsel for all Claimants and counsel for the responding party each shall then select 10 Claimant Notices to proceed as Arbitration Demands. Claimants shall then file Arbitration Demands for the 20 selected Claimant Notices. No Claimant Notice or Arbitration Demand may be filed or deemed filed, and no related arbitration fees may be assessed, until the Claimant Notice is selected to proceed to arbitration following the process set forth in this Section. A single arbitrator will preside over each Arbitration Demand, and shall preside only over one Arbitration Demand, unless the parties agree otherwise. Mediation . Upon conclusion of the 20 Initial Arbitrations (or sooner if the parties agree) and before proceeding with any other Arbitration Demands, the parties must engage in a single mediation applicable to all Claimant Notices in the Mass Dispute. The parties shall have 30 days following the conclusion of the last of the initial arbitrations to agree on a mediator. If they are unable to do so, the AAA may appoint one as an administrative matter. No additional Arbitration Demands may be filed until 30 days after such mediation concludes or 90 days after the appointment of a mediator, whichever is sooner. Remaining Claimant Notices and Arbitrations . If mediation concludes with 100 or more unresolved Claimant Notices, any remaining Claimant or the receiving party to a remaining Claimant Notice may opt out of arbitration of all Claimant Notices that were not resolved in the initial 20 Arbitration Demands or mediation. Such an election may only be for all Claimant Notices remaining in the Mass Dispute, not a portion thereof. To be effective, such election must be communicated in writing (email suffices) to counsel for the other party within 30 days of mediation concluding. Claimant Notices released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved according to Section 14. If complaints based on Claimant Notices that were released from the arbitration requirement are filed in court, the Claimants may seek class treatment, although to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the putative classes must be limited to those Claimants in the Mass Dispute whose claims remain unresolved, and for which a Claimant Notice was received by the other party. Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis and may raise any other defenses available under applicable law. If the mediation process concludes with fewer than 100 Claimant Notices remaining or if no timely election to opt out of arbitration is made, the AAA will randomly select 30 Claimant Notices (or the total remaining if less than 30) that comply with Section 13(b) to proceed in arbitration in the same manner as described in Section 13(i)(2), above. Once such arbitrations have concluded, the parties will repeat this process until all Claimant Notices in the Mass Dispute have been resolved. Opting Out of Arbitration . You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted a version of these Terms by emailing legal@allbirds.com. To be effective, the opt-out notice must be on your own behalf and include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration in order to be valid. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 14. Rejection of Modifications to this Section 13. You may reject any change we make to this Section 13 (except changes to notice addresses) as to you, by emailing legal@allbirds.com within 30 days of the date of the change. To be effective, you must send the notice or rejection on your own behalf, and you must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to Section 13. You may reject changes to Section 13 only as a whole. You may not reject only certain changes to Section 13. If you reject changes made to Section 13, the most recent version of Section 13 that you have not rejected will continue to apply. Severability . If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 13 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 13; and (iii) to the extent that any claims may proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with these Terms, and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 13 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 13 will be enforceable. 14. Governing Law and Venue Any dispute, claim, or controversy arises from or relates to these Terms or the Platform will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or relating to these Terms, the Platform, or the products purchased from the Platform that is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 13 and that cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved exclusively in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. You and Allbirds waive any objection to venue in any such courts. If your local law requires that consumer contracts be interpreted subject to local law and enforced in the courts of that jurisdiction, this section will not apply to you to the extent that local law conflicts with this section. 15.
