July 30, 2018 Sorry About The New Site Glitches We switched database servers last night, and a config entry got lost somewhere, and as a result users couldn't post new blog entries or upload files. Pages loaded, commenting worked, even editing existing entries worked, just those two things. The person responsible for sacking the person responsible for sacking the person responsible, has been sacked.

March 29, 2015 Sorry About The Site Glitches Our statistics database filled up.  This wasn't immediately obvious from the logs, and since it was due to a size limit being set too low rather than running out of server resources, it wasn't obvious from the state of the server. It's been addressed now, the server processes have been restarted to clean up any hung connections, and all should be well with the world.

And I mean that literally.  Parts of it still haven't been found. We had to restore from backups and individual magnetic monopoles retrieved from the crater using portable atomic force microscopes. Or possibly our RAID controller failed and wiped out our main drive array and we had to manually recover the crashed databases and restore the virtual servers from off-site backups. But frankly, I think it exploded. Posted by: Pixy Misa at 01:45 PM | Comments (1207) | Add Comment Post contains 77 words, total size 1 kb. July 06, 2012 Where Did My Blog Go? The first question to ask yourself is, are you a spammer?* If you are, that's where your blog went. If not, sorry!  Contact us at help@mee.nu and we'll get you sorted out. * If your blog contains text like "Preheat the oven to 450 college diplomas.", then you're either a spammer or a dadaist.

As we do a little spring cleaning, get rid of the mothballs and the cobwebs, and - bunny!! In the coming months we'll be sprucing up the site from top to bottom, or possibly from bottom to top, from server hardware to site designs.  Stay tuned for further updates, same bunny time, same bunny channel. So much spam to zap.  Sigh... <sings scansion=awful>Two hours of zapping spam / buys a one-way pass on the uptown tram / I'm a blogger of means by no means / Pix' of the road.</sings> There, much better!

August 27, 2011 Planned Downtime - 1AM CDT 28th August 2011 We'll be taking a short outage at 1AM CDT this Sunday to swap out the drive that failed during last weekend's power outage.  Should only be about 15 minutes. Update: Took a little longer than expected, but maintenance completed successfully. Posted by: Pixy Misa at 04:15 AM | No Comments

August 20, 2011 Very Unplanned Downtime I was supposed to be in a conference session on hosting Python web applications right about now, but we had a drive failure, which caused a server reboot, which caused a lengthy filesystem check, and when that was done we tripped over a network configuration problem (unnoticed previously since the server hadn't been rebooted in nearly 18 months) and then found that some MySQL tables had been corrupted by the crash and needed to be repaired. Oh, and the shared filesystem for user uploads was offline too, which made the blogs look a little spartan for a while. Which has all been fixed now, so I hope to make some of the later conference sessions. Sorry about the downtime folks, and enjoy the rest of your weekend! Update: Turns out that the root cause was a power failure at our hosting company.  That triggered the drive failure and reboot the server and lead to an unpleasant morning here at mee.nu HQ.
