Learn more Get Total Drive Premium Subscription, Refunds, and Offer FAQ’s What plans do you offer? We offer monthly, quarterly, biannual, and annual subscription plans that automatically renew unless canceled. * Unless you cancel before the end of your initial term, your plan will automatically renew at the then-regular rate ** and will continue to do so unless you cancel. How do I cancel my plan? To cancel, log into your online portal and visit the My Subscriptions section. If you would like step-by-step instructions, visit our cancellation guide. How do I receive a refund? If you would like to request a refund, you must first fully terminate your subscription. Cancelling your subscription (i.e., turning off auto-renewal) will not end your access or automatically trigger a refund. You are only eligible for a refund if you submit a request within 30 days of starting an annual or biannual plan, or within 14 days of starting a monthly or quarterly plan. 4 If your refund request is approved, your access to the service will end immediately. How do I manage subscriptions to multiple services? If you've purchased multiple subscription services from Total Drive or related brands under the Total Security umbrella, such as TotalAV™ or Total VPN, and used the same email address, your plans may appear under a unified login for convenience. However, each subscription is still managed individually. Add-on services or other linked plans must be canceled separately if you no longer wish to continue them.
