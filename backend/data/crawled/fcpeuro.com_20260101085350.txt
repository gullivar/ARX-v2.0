The FCP Euro Story and Vision FCP Euro was established by Harry and Kathy Bauer in 1986 as a brick and mortar auto parts store located in Groton, Connecticut servicing the local Volvo and BMW parts markets. In 2001 the brick and mortar store was taken online through Ebay by Nick Bauer and good friend Scott Drozd. Over the next few years Nick and Scott began to develop a website where they listed the entire catalog online of European Car Parts as well as develop their kitted products and reputation for great customer service. It is our vision to be the most valued and trusted European online auto parts retailer in the world, through the relentless pursuit of quality and service. We pride ourselves in offering the highest quality replacement auto parts, unparalleled customer service, and providing the do-it-yourself enthusiast the knowledge and technical support to help maintain and own their vehicles. We do this by hand curating our catalog with only the highest quality OEM parts such as Bosch, Sachs, Bilstein, Lemforder, and Brembo. We have developed an extensive YouTube library of Do-It-Yourself instructional content that help car owners fix and maintain their vehicles, with hopes of providing them a more enjoyable car ownership experience. Based out of Milford, CT, our 100,000 square foot distribution center holds over $10 Million of in-stock inventory ready to ship out the same day. We’ve committed ourselves to building our company based on quality, service, and continuous improvement, and we recognize that the growth and success of FCP Euro over the years is because of customers like you who faithfully support our business.
