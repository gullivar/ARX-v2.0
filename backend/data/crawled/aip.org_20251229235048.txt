AGU Congressional Science Fellow

The American Geophysical Union Congressional Science Fellowship program places highly qualified and accomplished professionals in the office of an individual member of Congress or on a committee for a one-year assignment.

The program allows our federal government to more effectively use scientific knowledge and provides scientists with the opportunity to make significant contributions to public policy during their time on Capitol Hill. Apply here.

AAS Action Alert: Keep STEM Talent Act

The past year has brought considerable uncertainty and cuts to the United States STEM workforce. This includes federal employees at science agencies such as NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy, as well as students and researchers nationwide.

Use this form from the American Astronomical Society to ask your members of Congress to support the Keep STEM Talent Act

AGU: Speak Out to Save NCAR today!

The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will be dismantled, according to Administration officials. NCAR provides key weather and climate research and data that is critical for businesses, the public, and advancing research. Its advanced computing allows its to run weather and climate models that help predict severe storms, allows for farmers to prepare for long-term weather patterns, and airlines to fly safely.

Fill out this form from the American Geophysical Union to urge your members of Congress to speak out.

AAPM: NIST Needs Your Support Now

You can make a difference! Tell Congress about the essential work conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The FY26 proposed budget signals a 28% reduction in funding for the NIST. NIST provides many key and irreplaceable services to the medical physics profession.

Use the American Association of Physicists in Medicine‘s letter template here to email your Members of Congress.

APS: Call to Action, Help Fund Science in 2026

After the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, our government is back up and running, largely funded by a short-term Continuing Resolution through Jan. 30, 2026. Select your state, add your story, and fill out the form to urge your senators and representatives to support robust funding for science.

All supporters of science are welcome to participate in this American Physical Society initiative.

AIP Congressional Science Policy Fellowships

The American Institute of Physics sponsors two scientists annually to spend a year providing analytical expertise and scientific advice to Congress. This enables scientists to broaden their experience through direct involvement with the legislative and policy processes.

Applications are now open! Apply here by December 1, 2025.

APS Survey: Impacts of Federal Science Funding

This survey by the American Physical Society collects stories showcasing the transformative positive impact of NSF, NIST, DOE, NASA, and DOD-funded research and programs as well as what would be lost if support for basic research evaporates. You can document your experiences and share how recent executive actions have impacted you.

AAS Membership Support

The American Astronomical Society is deeply concerned about reductions in force at federal agencies, the cancellation and/or suspension of federal grants, and rumored deep cuts to science funding. Keep checking, AAS will update resources, information, and actions for AAS members during this challenging time. Request a membership waiver, seek meeting support for AAS 246, and other resources.

AIMBE Resources for Science and Engineering Advocacy

Take action! The American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering is your public policy advocate. AIMBE outlines actions you can take to advocate for science and engineering. Check out this page for local, state, and federal resources.

AIMBE: Survey Results, Impacts of Distruptions

The American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering surveyed biomedical/biological engineering departments across the country to assess the impact of disruptions to research and training since January 2025.

Check out the survey results and infographics.

AMS Support for the Weather, Water, Climate Community

The American Meteorological Society has temporarily opened a variety of services to the entire community regardless of membership status. If you have been affected by ongoing cuts to U.S. federal budgets and staffing, please make use of any of these resources that you need.

AGU: Crafting Your Message for Policymakers

It is up to you to be persuasive in support of your request or “ask.” That means explicitly showing the policymakers how supporting your ask benefits their and their constituents’ interests and fits with their values. Check out the American Geophysical Union’s worksheet for tips and guidance.

APS: Effective Meetings with Policymakers

Preparation and purpose are both key to a successful meeting with a policymaker’s office. A well-crafted and practiced message helps your argument be heard and understood. Learn more from the American Physical Society.

AGU: Elevate Science Policy

With the serious issues the world is facing today, the role of Earth and space science is more vital than ever. It’s never been more important for scientists to make their voices heard. Your advocacy strengthens the voice of science and offers crucial testimony that only you can give.

Use this form from the American Geophysical Union to your representatives quicker, easier, and on the issues you care about most.

APS: Take Action Now

Support federal science funding. Tell Congress why science matters. The American Physical Society, alongside our partners ask you to take action in defense of DOD, DOE, NASA, NIST, and NSF science funding.

It’s time to advocate for science and scientists — and convince Congress to reject these cuts.

AAPM Action Center

Share your story. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine is seeking input from our membership to shape our Advocacy Agenda and strengthen our targeted advocacy and lobbying efforts. For those who wish to engage with their elected officials, AAPM has set up an additional take-action campaign to make the process simpler.

APS: Make Your Voice Heard

Take action for the scientific community by contacting your elected officials about important issues. Learn more about the American Physical Society’s 2025 advocacy priorities. Contact your members of Congress and make your voice heard through the portals on this page.

AGU Tips for Creating a One-Pager

Creating a good one-pager ensures that legislators and their staff remember you, your science, and the issues you care about. Check out these tips and this template to create your one-pager as part of the American Geophysical Union’s Sharing Science Program.

AAS: Ask Congress to Support the Sciences

One of the most effective ways to make your voice heard is through a constituent appropriations request — essentially, asking your congressional representative to direct funding toward a particular area. Check out resources from the American Astronomical Society for steps on how to submit constituent appropriations requests.
