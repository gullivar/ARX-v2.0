Learn More Learn More Mathnasium Frequently Asked Questions Our Approach & Instructors Assessments, Programs & Results What makes Mathnasium instructors effective? Our instructors are more than just good at math, they’re trained in how to teach it. Every Mathnasium instructor is certified in the Mathnasium Method™, and knows how to break down complex ideas, explain clearly, and build trust with students. They’re supportive, patient, and genuinely want your child to succeed. How are Mathnasium instructors different from private tutors? Tutors often work solo and vary in training. Our instructors are part of a team, trained in a structured approach, and supported by a proven curriculum. Why is Mathnasium better than AI tutoring? AI can give answers, but it can't truly teach. Our instructors recognize confusion, adapt their approach in real time, explain concepts in multiple ways, and build genuine connections. Learning is a human process, and that’s what we offer. What makes Mathnasium different from school help or homework apps? We don’t just help kids get through today’s assignment. We focus on long-term growth by identifying gaps, building skills, and fostering deep understanding. Will Mathnasium help with my child’s homework? Yes. Homework help is included as part of our sessions. We guide students through challenging problems and ensure they understand the underlying concepts, reducing frustration and building independence. Can Mathnasium help advanced students too? Absolutely. We offer enrichment programs and placement prep to keep high performers challenged and motivated. Do kids actually like coming to Mathnasium? Yes! As math starts making sense, confidence grows. We create a supportive, focused, and genuinely rewarding environment. Is Mathnasium available online? Yes. Our live, online sessions are taught by the same instructors using the same curriculum, delivering the same results, from the comfort of home. What happens during the initial assessment? We start by connecting with your child, giving a short center tour, and setting expectations. Our assessments combine verbal and written components to identify strengths, gaps, and learning styles, all in a low-pressure, interactive way that doesn’t feel like a test. Do you help students prepare for standardized tests like the SAT or ACT? Yes. We support a variety of math assessments, including school tests, placement exams, and standardized tests like the SAT and ACT, focusing on core skills and problem-solving, not just test tricks. How does Mathnasium customize learning plans? Based on your child’s assessment, we create a personalized learning plan tailored to their specific strengths, needs, and goals, whether they need support, enrichment, or both. How often should my child attend Mathnasium? Frequency depends on your child’s goals. Most families attend 2–3 times per week to ensure consistent progress, but we’ll help you find the right schedule during enrollment. How long does it take to see results? Every child is different, but families often report increased confidence and noticeable improvement in skills within a few months of regular attendance. Does Mathnasium teach problem-solving strategies? Yes. Beyond math facts, we emphasize logical thinking, number sense, and problem-solving skills that serve students in school and beyond. What ages and grade levels does Mathnasium serve? We work with students in grades K–12, customizing our approach for each age, grade level, and skill set. Whether they need support, enrichment, or test prep, we adapt to meet them where they are. Can Mathnasium help if my child has math anxiety? Yes. Our patient, encouraging approach builds confidence and reduces fear by helping students experience real success in math. What does Mathnasium cost? Mathnasium provides premium value by combining a superior learning experience with an efficient structure that keeps costs low. There is a flat enrollment fee for our program, and students attend regularly—much like a gym membership.
