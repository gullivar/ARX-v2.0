"It’s surprising to me that even after more than a year in this space some people still fall for this stealth mint scam?   

Download  @PocketUniverseZ  for fucks sake" Tma420.eth @Tma_420 "Some of them are so difficult to tell! 

@PocketUniverseZ saved me once from a fake Collab land scam that would have drained high value NFTs. I recommend at least running contacts through them before signing." Atheenas @atheenas "... we all gotta be protecting ourselves better from these MF scums! 

Idk what y’all doing if you still don’t have @PocketUniverseZ installed on your devices. It’s literally a life saver ..." Spike @LVSpike420 "@PocketUniverseZ is such a cool extension to have..let's you see what you're signing before the actual tx window👁️
Might save your bag.." deNurse @patricklabelle7 "GM, 

@PocketUniverseZ just saved my ass from some fake Ether phishing site. (I wasn't going to mint, was just doing research but can't even be safe surveying the space anymore..." Malloy @AhoiMalloy "100%, must have chrome extension!" wale.swoosh @waleswoosh "Thanks to your awesome extension, I narrowly avoided a potential disaster last night 😓 

... your extension saved the day and protected my wallet from being drained🛡️" Alessa @alessa_nft "GM. As we sometimes mistakenly clicked a rogue link; I did so last night.  I was saved by @PocketUniverseZ from losing all my ETH treasures. 

It's criminal that they are a free tool."
