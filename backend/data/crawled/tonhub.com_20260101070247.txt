What happens if my crypto balance is insufficient during payment?

Security Notice & Fraud Prevention
Tonhub Card utilizes advanced security and non-custodial blockchain technology to protect our users. All transactions are permanently monitored by sophisticated anti-fraud systems.
Important:

Any attempts to conduct fraudulent transactions, including false refund requests, using third-party accounts (drops), or exploiting our card services, are automatically detected.

All identified cases of fraud, scams, unauthorized refunds, or suspicious activities will be immediately flagged. We will initiate a formal investigation and report to law enforcement authorities.

Non-custodial responsibility:

Tonhub is a non-custodial service, meaning you alone control your crypto balance. Any attempts to exploit the card without proper balance funding or authorization will fail and may result in legal consequences.

We are committed to maintaining a safe financial environment for all our users. Thank you for your cooperation and vigilance.
