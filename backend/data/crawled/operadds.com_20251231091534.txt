No more copying, scanning and shredding, the administrative team loves this! They also are very happy to save several trees in the process!” Deanne Recktenwald, Practice Administrator, RDH IQ Family & Cosmetic Dentistry I really love all the features of OperaDDS. The Recall messages are customizable and very easy to manage, and also the "Action Required" tab makes it so easy to reach out to patients and work with them for whatever concerns they have. The Chat system in office is awesome. We are loving it! Dr. Grace Chung General Dentist “I traveled to Ireland in May and stayed in contact with the office each day by accessing Opera. I was able to check in with each person, answer any questions, etc. So Opera is a world travel companion too!” Dr. Tim Goodheart General Dentist "With OperaDDS we can exchange information through a user friendly platform that rids us of the traditional communication systems that more often than not, fail. I used to think that communication was the weak link in our office; OperaDDS has definitely changed this." Dr. Renee Camara Periodontist “We use OperaDDS chat, forms and secure email. Absolutely love it!!!!” Dr. James Klim Cosmetic and Restorative Dentist “I’ve been a user and fan of the OperaDDS app for many years now. Having a very busy practice, I was always on the lookout for a quality office communication system that could reduce some of the chaos and keep us running efficiently and professionally.   Then I found OperaDDS.  I love the Chat feature with the Apple Watch to communicate back and forth with my team.  I don’t have to take my phone with me. It’s perfect!  It makes my workday so smooth!” Dr. Brandon Tiek General Dentist “OperaDDS has been a great addition to our office. It is rare to have a dental software rapidly evolve and improve over time. OperaDDS does both. So many HIPAA compliant services are complicated and hard to implement. OperaDDS is very simple and intuitive. The service is very easy to use and as more pieces are brought online it becomes an even more valuable tool. The level of customer care that the company provides is incredible. I would highly recommend this service for anyone looking to simplify their HIPAA compliant communications.” Dr. Jesse Hagen General Dentist Start Growing Your Practice Today Want to learn more?
