Teagan

South Africa

Worldpackers is the reason I get to really experience new cultures. I get to live in different countries and meet the most amazing people.

Gabriel

Brazil

Worldpackers is beyond 'traveling while saving money.' It’s about feeling a little more about the place where you are, meeting people and sharing stories and experiences. Values that you carry for the rest of your life!

Helka

Hungary

In my opinion, the best way to learn about ourselves and also about the world is through traveling. When combined with volunteering, it allows you to get an even deeper sense of the chosen place and experience the local way of life. It's also nice to be able to give something back in exchange for the amazing memories you make on the journey.

Izabella

Brazil

Worldpackers has helped me a lot since I left home and decided to go backpacking, without this platform I don't know if I would have been able to get this far and have had all the experiences I have had <3

Patty

Brazil

It was an incredible experience! I think this intermediary between those who want to receive and those who want to travel is perfect for getting to know the local culture. Get to know people, places, and things that you wouldn't know if you were on a tourist trip. Incredible! They are to be congratulated!

Nathalia

Brazil

The exchange that Worldpackers offers is very good. It's not just a considerable saving on accommodation, but a really cool network, connections, and unforgettable experiences away from home!

Roció

Argentina

It is a practical and safe app. In my experience, I have met many solo female volunteers who travel with the app, and most of us think that it is an excellent tool for safe travel.

Li

Costa Rica

It is an excellent platform! Volunteering is a unique experience that every person should live at some point in their life.

Micaele

Brazil

I believe Worldpackers' special mission is to improve the world and motivate people to be happy, travel, and do good. Since I discovered Worldpackers, I highly recommend it to friends, family, and anyone with whom the subject comes up.

Maya

Netherlands

I like the way it gives you the chance to not only visit another country but to feel like you are immersed there, living there, and have a family there.
