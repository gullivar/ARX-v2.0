The result: every point of purchase becomes a trusted, high-converting experience that drives ecommerce growth.
When the right customer meets the right product, everyone wins.
Be discovered.

Get your products in front of people wherever they shop.
Through Bazaarvoice’s retail syndication network, your reviews, photos, and real customer stories travel across our massive network of retailers — more than 13,000 brands — so shoppers (and AI) can find you the moment they start looking.

Be trusted.

Shoppers want the truth — not marketing speak.
Bazaarvoice helps you earn their confidence with verified ratings, reviews, Q&A, and visual UGC that they know they can rely on. Our Ratings and Reviews platform and Intelligent Trust Mark make it clear what’s real and worth choosing.

Be chosen.

When people see honest experiences from other shoppers, “Add to Cart” is an easy click. That’s why social proof through creator marketing and product sampling programs drives real results, including higher first-time conversion and repeat buyers. Visual UGC can lift sales dramatically, and our platform makes it simple to showcase it in shoppable galleries and creator content and on your product pages.

A complete toolbox for the entire ecommerce journey.

The Bazaarvoice platform brings all your UGC together in one place. With a full suite of products to help you along your ecommerce journey, you’ll have all the tools you need for scalable sales growth.
