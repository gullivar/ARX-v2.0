“FeatureOps is more than just toggles — it’s a cultural and technical lever for fearless delivery. Before we adopted FeatureOps, releases were big-bang events — stressful, risky, and slow. With Unleash as our FeatureOps control plane, we now release to production over 100 times a day, get faster feedback on what’s working, and experiment with confidence.”

Sergio Revilla Velasco

Head of Engineering, Mercadona Tech

"We flipped the most important flag we could when we went from our in-house system to Unleash. Right away we found that it was scalable, highly performant, resilient out of the box. And Unleash ended up being 1/3 the cost of our homegrown feature flag solution, while also improving the reliability and scalability of our platform."

Mark Quigley

Head of Internal Developer Platforms and Engineering Enablement, Wayfair

“The enterprise space is not simple. We’re a 150-year-old company with everything from COBOL to LLMs. Our customers rely on us for their insurance, retirement, and financial needs. Reliability is essential. We needed a vendor that truly understood the enterprise space—and Unleash was definitely the right choice.”

Joseph Garcia

Lead DevOps Engineer, Prudential

"Unleash gave us the flexibility to manage feature rollouts across multiple services and environments, allowing us to scale without fear of major rollbacks."

Norbert Borecki

Senior Software Engineer, Tink, A Visa Solution

"We needed a solution that met enterprise needs — with enterprise-grade security, fine-grained role-based access, and seamless SAML integration. Unleash delivered exactly that, along with robust experimentation features and broad integration support. Very quickly, our entire team adopted it. Now you regularly hear, ‘just put the feature behind an Unleash flag.’ And it’s not just engineering — QA, product management, and even pre-sales are all onboard."

Sitarama Maruvada

Director, SaaS Cloud, Lenovo

"Even the smallest change — a recommendation tweak or checkout update — can ripple through millions of customers and risk millions in revenue. But with Unleash, even during Black Friday spikes, our system doesn’t blink. Failures never become outages — it’s resilient and failure-proof."

Site Reliability Engineer, Wayfair

Unleash ranked as top Feature Management Software on G2
We serve the needs of some of the largest and most security-conscious organizations in the world, but we were also rated the “Easiest Feature Management system to use” by G2.
Why you shouldn’t wait to implement an Enterprise Feature Management Platform
Downtime risk
Flaky features cause downtime. On average, application downtime costs organizations $400,000 per hour, and more than half of organizations face unexpected downtime every two months.
Reduced Innovation
When developers are forced to use tools and processes they hate, like infrequent high-stakes releases based on complex branching strategies, innovation is reduced by 50%.
Home-grown solutions don’t scale
Many organizations attempt to solve downtime risk and reduced innovation by building a feature flag solution in-house, but often, features and UX are lacking, the maintenance burden is high, and reliability is low. Under such circumstances, release velocity suffers, and the best talent starts to look elsewhere.
