What do ESL and EFL mean? ESL stands for English as a Second Language. EFL stands for English as a Foreign Language. ESL is used when people learn English in an English speaking country. EFL is used when people learn English in a non-English speaking country. Is this important? Not very, if you are a learner. But there are some important technical considerations for teachers. (The same is true for TESL—Teaching English as a Second Language—and TEFL—Teaching English as a Foreign Language.)
