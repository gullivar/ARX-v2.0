Proof, not promises
Corin Birchall
Head of Retail, Global

We needed a platform that was ready for deployment, rather than building something from scratch. Within a week, we had TalentLMS up and running and developed about 10 courses. That helped our teams respond to the sudden changes in the market.

Caroline Watson
Head of Product Marketing

The TalentLMS platform is intuitive and quick to set up allowing our teams around the world to access up-to-date courses without the need to install software. And it’s mobile friendly, allowing our ‘remote’ sales representatives to gain knowledge and training on a more regular basis.

Lucas Weber
Product Marketing Manager

Before TalentLMS, we would send an email and hope everyone figures it out. Now we can ensure every person has taken the training. It’s as simple as that.
