He wants to make this clear: Conrad Rockenhaus is NOT suicidal, he is dying from medical neglect. If something happens to him, it was externally caused. He wants to live, he wants to be at peace, he wants to come home. A government agency listing a disabled veteran as "expensive" and "suicidal" while his wife screams that they are trying to kill him.

Since then, our analysts have written over 1 million words on new technologies, global industry, and the world's key live players. You know the drill. Here are the 7 most important things we learned about how the world works in 2025: #1 - The prime input for AI progress is elite math and computer talent. The “scaling hypothesis" that only more data and compute are needed to make further AI advancements neglects the foundational input necessary before all others: top STEM talent, often from academia. Overlooking this fact is arguably what caused observers to underestimate China’s potential for catch-up AI progress until DeepSeek's debut in 2025. Multiple labs drawing on China’s vast domestic reserve of math and computer talent have since made global splashes of their own. Read 35 tweets Adrienne Rockenhaus @adezero Dec 30 "Action T4" (German: Aktion T4) was the codename for the Nazi German campaign of mass murder by involuntary "euthanasia" that targeted people with physical and mental disabilities in Germany and occupied territories from 1939 to 1945. The name T4 was an abbreviation of the address Tiergartenstraße 4, a villa in Berlin that served as the program's headquarters. https://x.com/adezero/status/2005884472881746227 To connect the dots: The Prison has Neo-Nazi guards. The Prosecutor targets the disabled. Conclusion: This is a coordinated ideological purge, just like T4. rockenhaus.com/judicial-malpr… @threadreaderapp unroll Read 5 tweets 𝔸η𝐓 @AntSpeaks Dec 30 A 🧵 dismantling this post (linked below), which claims that Zionism is anti-Christian. It was created by someone who suddenly realised that jumping on the anti-Zionist bandwagon would get him more views and engagement. I'm tagging these accounts who should see this and can add additional information and context if needed: @ApostateProphet @GovMikeHuckabee @ChayasClan @DefiyantlyFree @beholdisrael @DumisaniTemsgen @MosabHasanYOSEF @TRobinsonNewEra Link to the original post: x.com/WorldByWolf/st… Each paragraph will be addressed separately🧵: 1. First Paragraph: "Zionists never discuss the fact that 90,000 Christians were victims of the Nakba and 30 churches were shut down as a result. Palestine in 1948 was 12.5% Christian but that number is now just 1%." Well, firstly, the Nakba narrative is a lie, and the simplest way to see this is that today 20 percent of Israel’s population is Arab Muslim. The decline in the Christian population at the time is real, but the numbers often cited are exaggerated. Most of the drop came from emigration, lower birth rates, and general upheaval, not targeted actions. Claims that 90,000 Christians were expelled or that 30 churches were closed come mainly from Palestinian political sources and are not supported by independent historical research. Today, Christianity is actually thriving in Israel compared with the rest of the Middle East. Christian communities are growing, churches are active, and Christians enjoy freedom of worship and strong representation in society, which is increasingly rare in neighbouring countries. 2. Second Paragraph: "The Haganah terror group, which the first Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion led, bombed the Semiramis Hotel in 1948 which killed 25 Christians and there are countless stories of massacres of Christians including in historic cities such as Nazareth and Galilee." The Semiramis Hotel bombing in January 1948 was carried out by the Haganah during the civil war after the UN partition plan. Around two dozen people were killed, but the hotel was targeted for its links to armed militias, not because of religion. Claims of massacres of Christians in Nazareth or the Galilee are not supported by credible historical research. There is NO evidence that Christians were specifically targeted.

To get confirmed on December 18, he had to ensure there were no "active scandals" involving his office beating disabled veterans. He suppressed the video of the raid and the proof of perjury. By burying the evidence of the assault, he also buried the evidence of the Neo-Nazis who committed it. rockenhaus.com/demand-for-oig… Eastern District of Michigan Federal Court / Government: Judge Jonathan J.C.

Now, he has been frantically smearing me for 24 hours straight because I advised Cameron Kasky to get to the West Bank by way of Tel Aviv, where he’d be less likely to get turned away than he would through Jordan. This is the same advice he was given by the many Palestinians I put him in touch with. I wouldn’t expect ‘Bad Empanada’ to know such things, since he admitted he’s never attempted to visit Palestine since they’d “never let him in.” To be clear, this person knows nothing about me and has gotten virtually every detail of my life and work wrong. The lies and smears are tedious enough, but it’s the pathetic bravado of someone who records YouTube videos from his basement all day that really gets me. A miserable, cynical liar of the first order who cares about no one but himself. It is unfortunate that people like this have any platform at all, but I take great comfort in knowing that there are Palestinians all across the West Bank who consider me family, and who would laugh this fucking loser right out of town. Literally nothing about this is correct lol. Just bizarre Read 4 tweets See All Recent Did Thread Reader help you today? Support us! We are indie developers!
