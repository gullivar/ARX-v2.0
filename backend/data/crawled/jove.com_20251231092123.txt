By seeing methods in action, researchers can better replicate experiments and avoid misinterpretation. It improves reproducibility and saves time in the lab.” Morven A. Cameron Researcher Western Sydney University × “For teaching, JoVE videos provide a level of clarity and engagement that textbooks alone cannot achieve. Students are able to visualize complex concepts and processes, which enhances learning and retention.” Edwin S. Monuki Educator University of California, Irvine × “The video brings the research to life and I think that's important for a user community … it is a time-saver in many ways as well.” Delphine Dean Author Clemson University × “From a library perspective, JoVE is a valuable resource. It supports both instruction and research, offering a multimedia tool that appeals to diverse learners and maximizes institutional resources.” Donna Gibson Librarian Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center × 1,800+ Universities and Companies Use JoVE 30,000+ Lab Methods and Concept Videos 2X Increase in Students' Grades 1,800+ Institutions and Corporates Partnering with JoVE Previous Next Contact Us Recommend to Library Research JoVE Journal JoVE Encyclopedia of Experiments JoVE Visualize Business JoVE Business Education JoVE Core JoVE Science Education JoVE Lab Manual JoVE Quizzes Solutions Authors Teaching Faculty Librarians K12 Schools About JoVE Overview Leadership Others JoVE Newsletters JoVE Help Center Blogs Site Maps Contact Us Recommend to Library Copyright © 2025 MyJoVE Corporation.
