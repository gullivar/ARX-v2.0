‘I Was Just So Naïve’: Inside Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Break With Trump

29 MIN READ

Robert Draper

I’ve reported for the past two months on Marjorie Taylor Greene’s sudden isolation in Congress and her decision to resign from her House seat after President Trump called her a “traitor.” She spoke with me in two on-the-record interviews that were remarkably candid.

Robert Draper

Greene told me that the death of Charlie Kirk was clarifying for her. She watched Kirk’s widow, Erika, speak at his memorial about love and forgiveness, and then watched Trump follow her speech with one in which he said, “I hate my opponent.”

Robert Draper

Greene arrived in Congress in 2021 with no political experience but a reputation as a MAGA acolyte and conspiratorial flame-thrower who had accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others of “treason” that should be punished by imprisonment or death.

Robert Draper

She told me that she now recognizes her own part in what she calls “this toxic culture” that has left her disgusted with politics. She once believed that Trump wanted to help ordinary people but has since been disillusioned by his actions and statements. “I was so naïve,” she said.
