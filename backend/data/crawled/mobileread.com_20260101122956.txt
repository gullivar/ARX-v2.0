Sat December 13 2025 Amazon to allow downloads of DRM free books 09:58 AM by jhowell in E-Book Readers | Amazon Kindle From Digital Rights Management on Amazon KDP: Effective January 20, 2026, verified purchasers can download the EPUB and PDF files of your confirmed DRM-free books. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technology you can apply when publishing your eBook that affects how readers can access their purchased content. Applying DRM limits reader access to Kindle apps and devices only. DRM technology is designed to limit unauthorized access to or copying of digital content files. Choosing not to apply DRM (DRM-free) gives readers additional flexibility to enjoy their purchased content across a wider range of devices and applications by providing downloadable EPUB and PDF files. Your royalty rates and payment structure remain unchanged regardless of your DRM selection. Reader download access Effective January 20, 2026, readers can download EPUB and PDF files of your DRM-free books from their Manage Your Content and Devices page on Amazon. Only verified purchasers who have bought your book can access the EPUB/PDF files. Customers who borrowed your books through Kindle Unlimited or other services can't download the EPUB/PDF files, even if the books are DRM-free. If readers downloaded EPUB/PDF files when your book was DRM-free, they will retain access to those downloaded EPUB/PDF files even if you later apply DRM. However, the option to download EPUB/PDF files will not be available after your DRM setting change is live (approx. 24-72 hours after you publish).

Hoorah! Time to dig in to another digest of MobileRead delectables E-Book Readers - Amazon Kindle Amazon announces Kindle Scribe Colorsoft at Sept. 30 Devices Event Thu October 02 2025 Amazon announces Kindle Scribe Colorsoft at Sept. 30 Devices Event 09:44 AM by Frogm4n in E-Book Readers | Amazon Kindle Official Amazon PR announcement: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/dev...e-scribe-color Mentions a new stylus pen and new rendering engine for the display. Does not mention implementing the new Workspace and other notebook software features on the previous Scribe models. Does mention bringing the AI-powered book summary features to the iOS app and other Kindles. https://www.engadget.com/amazon-even...100017137.html (I'll add highlights here to save people needing to scroll the live feed) Kindle Scribe Kindle Scribe with FrontLight Kindle Scribe Colorsoft It is 5.4mm thick, 400g, and no longer has asymmetric bezels. The display stack was thinned, and has a claimed latency of under 12ms. The new design has both B&W and color display models. There is a Scribe Workspace app that allows import and export to Google Drive and OneDrive. You can export notes to OneNote and Alexa+. AI-powered Notebook search. Book summary Story So Far and Ask This Book are claimed to be spoiler-free and AI-powered. (They've moved to Echo devices so this is all for the Scribe) https://www.theverge.com/news/788289...notepad-stylus 11 inch display, up from the 10.2 of the 2022 and 2024 Scribes New Home screen with a Quick Notes section https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tabl...145031938.html This article calls it "Scribe 3" which I think is editorializing it like was done by calling the Scribe 2024 the "Scribe 2". https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tabl...145147981.html Engadget hands-on with the new Scribes. Their description wording makes it clear that it is Kaleido, like the other Colorsoft models. Like the Kindle Colorsoft that Amazon announced in 2023, the Scribe Colorsoft uses a color filter and LEDs. What’s slightly different is a new rendering engine that Amazon said “enhances the color and ensures writing is fast, fluid and totally natural.” The redesigned home page will be launching later this year, and older Kindle devices will be able to update to the new software. This still doesn't directly say if the older Scribe will be getting the new Workspace app and Notebook features. https://www.amazon.com/kindle/shop/kindle-scribe The official product pages are now public. In them Amazon describes the B&W models as: Generation Kindle Scribe (3rd Generation) And the color model as: Generation Kindle Scribe Colorsoft (1st Generation) I'll take back the comment that Engadget was editorializing about "Scribe 3", partially. Amazon is calling them the 3rd gen, but only the B&W models. They have skipped a generation, as the 2024 Scribe is still listed as: Kindle Scribe 1st generation - 2024 release [ 98 replies ] Sat July 26 2025 MobileRead Week in Review: 07/19 - 07/26 07:00 AM by Alexander Turcic in Miscellaneous | Week in Review Been away?
