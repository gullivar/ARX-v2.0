Science Release: 16 Dec. 2025 — noirlab2533 Bright Blue Cosmic Outbursts Likely Caused by Large Black Holes Shredding Massive Companions In 2024, astronomers discovered the brightest Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) ever observed. LFBOTs are extremely bright flashes of blue light that shine for brief periods before fading away. New analysis of this record-breaking burst, which includes observations from the International Gemini Observatory, funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation, challenges all prior understanding of these rare explosive events. Photo Release: 12 Dec. 2025 — noirlab2532 Gemini North Color Images Reveal Greenish Glow of Comet 3I/ATLAS Gemini North captured new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS after it reemerged from behind the Sun on its path out of the Solar System. The data were collected during a Shadow the Scientists session — a unique outreach initiative that invites students around the world to join researchers as they observe the Universe on the world’s most advanced telescopes. Science Release: 8 Dec. 2025 — noirlab2531 Gemini and Blanco Telescopes Unlock Clues to Origin of Longest Gamma-ray Burst Ever Observed Astronomers have observed the longest-ever gamma-ray burst — a powerful, extragalactic explosion that lasted over seven hours. Rapid follow-up observations with the U.S. Department of Energy-fabricated Dark Energy Camera and the International Gemini Observatory, funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated by NSF NOIRLab, provided crucial information about the possible origin of this extraordinary event and the galaxy that hosts it. Photo Release: 26 Nov. 2025 — noirlab2530 Gemini South Celebrates 25th Anniversary With Stunning Snapshot of the Butterfly Nebula To celebrate 25 years since the completion of the International Gemini Observatory, students in Chile voted for the Gemini South telescope to image NGC 6302 — a billowing planetary nebula that resembles a cosmic butterfly.

In part two of our Gemini 25th Anniversary series, we dive into the international collaboration that helped establish the legacy of the International Gemini Observatory, and that now helps to shape its future. The International Gemini Observatory consists of twin 8.1-meter telescopes located in Chile and Hawai‘i. It is funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated by NSF NOIRLab. 19 Nov. 2025 25 Years of Gemini Part I: The Origin of the International Gemini Observatory In celebration of 25 years since the completion of the International Gemini Observatory, supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated by NSF NOIRLab, we reflect on how Fred Gillett’s passion for infrared astronomy built the foundation for the Gemini project, and how its implementation necessitated a scientifically motivated and united international community. This is part one of the NOIRLab Stories Blog series for Gemini Observatory’s 25th anniversary. 17 Oct. 2025 DESI and the History of the Universe Astronomer Tod Lauer reflects on his recent visit to the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter telescope where the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument is on a mission to map the Universe and uncover the secrets of dark energy. The Mayall is located at NSF Kitt Peak National Observatory, a Program of NSF NOIRLab, near Tucson, Arizona. 18 Sept. 2025 Remote Eyes on the Sky: Inside SLAC’s Rubin Control Room In the Rubin control room at SLAC, scientists watched in awe as the very first image captured by the LSST Camera appeared on their screens. With full operations set to begin this fall, the SLAC control room is becoming a vital hub for training, remote observing, and real-time support. 8 Sept. 2025 Vera C. Rubin and Her Work at Kitt Peak Astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin knew many things to be true. One, that a person may enjoy ice cream cones while reshaping humanity’s understanding of itself and the cosmos, she tested empirically. But another, and perhaps the most important, that we all have equal permission to do science, she proved by example during her long career as a scientist, professor, and advocate who fought for everyone’s right to take part in expanding our knowledge of the Universe. Our Programs From the first observations in 1965, Cerro Tololo, located in Chile, has served as the principal platform for U.S. astronomical investigation of the southern skies. Programs within the Community Science and Data Center support and enable a broad range of astronomical community science activities across the US ground-based optical and infrared system. Founded in 1958, Kitt Peak National Observatory is home to one of the largest arrays of optical and radio telescopes in the world. The Gemini Observatory consists of twin 8.1-meter diameter optical/infrared telescopes located on two of the best observing sites on the planet. Vera C. Rubin Observatory, currently under construction on Cerro Pachón in Chile, is an 8-meter-class telescope coupled to a 3.2-gigapixel camera – the world’s largest digital camera ever fabricated for optical astronomy.
