Monitor & analyze performance: Install and configure Blackfire. Enable Monitoring and Continuous Profiling on your production environment. Blackfire collects insights on your application's real behavior. You can now identify improvement opportunities and pinpoint when and where issues occur. Identify root causes: Use Blackfire's deterministic profiling to probe the root cause of issues down to the function or service call level. With this visibility, you can understand why performance bottlenecks occur and take informed actions to optimize them. Future-proof your app: Compare versions and performance before deploying a new version. Write performance tests to ensure that your improvements remain intact over time. Automate performance testing: Automate performance tests with Synthetic Monitoring . Integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline to prevent performance regressions before they reach production. Here's what results our clients achieved: 3 x Load time decrease for Symfony.com 1 month Faster time to market for NKD.com 20 x More orders for GOG.com Built in Europe by developers, for developers. Trusted worldwide, by teams like yours Blackfire was born from the world of open-source software in the heart of Europe. We saw engineering teams struggling with performance bottlenecks and drowning in observability data without answers. So we built a different kind of tool: one that delivers precise, actionable insights, helping developers stay in control of their applications, without the noise. Today, Blackfire is the leading Web Observability solution in Europe for decoupled PHP and Python applications — trusted by over 1,000 engineering teams worldwide. In 2021, we joined forces with Platform.sh , expanding our mission to provide 360° actionable observability. Together, we empower developers with the tools they need to build, scale, and optimize their applications confidently — with performance as a feature, not an afterthought. Continuous Profiling Monitoring Profiling Testing CI/CD Maximize performance efficiency with real-time insights Effortlessly identify and address performance bottlenecks, enhancing the efficiency of your application's most resource-intensive areas. Achieve high performance with low overhead while maintaining full observability of your entire application. Achieve instant bottleneck detection through continuous application monitoring and thorough code execution analysis. Live monitoring in production From overall application health to code-level insights, get facts and figures about how your application performs in production. Monitor server-side response time and memory usage. Drill-down and find bottlenecks in transactions and service calls (e.g., SQL, HTTP, queues). Obtain unrivaled visibility in your code's behavior while Blackfire automatically profiles key transactions. Receive an alert when something goes wrong. Deterministic profiling in production, development, test/staging Blackfire's unique deterministic profiling technology for PHP and Python collects function-call-level metrics that help you understand exactly how your code behaves. Through time-sequence and behavioral visualizations, analyze how code consumes time, memory, and network. Find slow SQL queries and HTTP requests. Collect these kinds of metrics from your live production site, then reproduce measurements on local machines. Iterate and compare iterations to validate code changes. Performance testing Performance is a feature. It should be tested as such. Thanks to Blackfire's cutting-edge profiler, extend your test suite from unit-tests, integration tests, and functional tests to performance tests. Never let a performance regression be deployed on production. Benefit from our extended support of PHP, Symfony, Laravel, Magento, Drupal, Typo3, Wordpress, Python, Django, with built-in metrics and default assertions. Automated testing workflows Synthetic user monitoring, CI/CD integration, unit tests integration? We've got you covered. Leverage Blackfire's flexible profiling automations to run performance tests proactively, whenever needed. Use the open-source crawler, scraper and tester, SDKs, and native integrations, or configure basic testing scenarios right from the Blackfire web application. Get comprehensive build reports and notifications where and when it matters—from email to Slack, and GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. “ Blackfire's continuous observability solution is empowering. Our teams can make early discoveries with the monitoring. Improvements in the code are based on the precise and detailed information collected while profiling parts of the applications. Then, by writing efficient performance tests and plugging them with our CI/CD pipeline, we avoid regressions of already-known performance issues. ” Marcin Czarnecki Backend Chapter Lead at GOG.com and Tech Lead for GOG Store Achieve top app speed with precise recommendations Blackfire gives you the insights you need to optimize performance, prevent issues, and future-proof your application—without the guesswork. Join thousands of PHP and Python developers who trust Blackfire to keep their applications running at peak efficiency. Find bottlenecks now!
