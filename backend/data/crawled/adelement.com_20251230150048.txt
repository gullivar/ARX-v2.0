VP, Syndic, Inc.

"Findmyfare.com has always had high traffic, but the conversions were low, not what we expected from a high traffic website. Thus being unable to justify our ROI. AdElement changed all that, using their dynamic retargeting option coupled with a strong publisher network, we were able to boost our conversions significantly."
