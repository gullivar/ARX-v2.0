Why choose .DE.COM?
UNRESTRICTED GLOBAL ACCESS

Unlike .de, which requires local administrative contact and business presence, .DE.COM is open to everyone, anywhere – no residency or business requirements needed.

GERMAN MARKET VISIBILITY WITH GLOBAL REACH

With .DE.COM, businesses can establish a clear German identity while benefiting from the global recognition of .COM. This allows international companies to expand into Germany without regulatory barriers.

SEO & MARKET ACCESSIBILITY

Our intent with .DE.COM is to be search engine-friendly by providing an unrestricted .COM variant specifically designed for businesses engaging with the German market. .DE.COM offers an international alternative without the limitations of local ccTLD restrictions.

PREMIUM AVAILABILITY

With millions of .de domains already registered, securing a short, brandable name is challenging. .DE.COM provides fresh opportunities with premium domain availability that is otherwise unavailable in .de.

SEAMLESS EXPANSION FOR BUSINESSES & STARTUPS

Whether you are a German business looking for international branding or an international company entering Germany, .DE.COM provides the flexibility and market reach that traditional ccTLDs cannot.

.DE.COM – The global domain for Germany

Germany is one of the world's largest and most influential economies, home to leading businesses, technology hubs, and a thriving digital landscape. .DE.COM provides an unrestricted, globally accessible domain solution for companies, entrepreneurs, and investors looking to establish a strong presence in Germany while maintaining international flexibility.

.DE.COM operates independently and has no affiliation with the German government, .DE or .COM. We are a decentralized and autonomous entity providing a competitive and unrestricted domain space.
