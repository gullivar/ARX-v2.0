Greg Lobanov (Chicory: A Colorful Tale) GameMaker is for everyone "It's easy to pick up and start learning. With GameMaker, making games is not only simple , but also fun ." Gabriel Gonçalves (Gagonfe) GameMaker is for everyone “GameMaker's systems were easy enough to approach as a novice and are now so second-nature to me that I'm comfortable tackling larger-scale problems that I wouldn't have dreamt of four years ago.” Carl Pilon (Orange Pylon Games) GameMaker is for everyone “Using GameMaker's in-built tools let me understand the role they play in game development and gave me the foundations I needed to go on to recreate any of them for myself in larger contexts. It was the perfect stepping stone for me to go from knowing nothing to feeling like I am an experienced games programmer.” Gabe Weiner (lazyeye) GameMaker is for everyone “GameMaker basically taught me how to make games.” Carlos Azuaga (CZAzuaga) GameMaker is for everyone “Everything I know about programming I learned thanks to GameMaker. It was my very first coding experience and I'm glad I stuck with it. The GameMaker community is also vast and there's tons of content in forums and tutorials, which made the learning process a lot less scary.” Matias Schmied (maitan69) GameMaker is for everyone “Honestly, without GameMaker, I probably wouldn't even have gotten to the hobby stage of game development.
