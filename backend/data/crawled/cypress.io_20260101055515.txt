Just look at those tests go 🥰 Tobias Struckmeier @tobmaster Go to tweet Every day I learn something awesome new about @Cypress_io. Its extensibility just makes it the super tool for new approaches and integrates in most environments. Especially when I compare it with other tools, it always feels easier and more stable to me. #testing Etienne Roudeix @__etienne Go to tweet Hey @Cypress_io just wanted to give you a big 👏👏👏 for the quality of your documentation. Thank you for the good work. brent @BrentA1283 Go to tweet I've been meaning to express my gratitude to the incredibly talented people who built and maintain the docs @Cypress_io. From start to finish, it's such an incredible platform and so much of that is due to how easy it is to get into it via the top notch documentation! Thank you! Henrik Joreteg @HenrikJoreteg Go to tweet Overall, settings up @Cypress_io's dashboard service and using GitHub actions to run all my Cypress tests in parallel has been a big win. Recommended 👍 Lumigo @Lumigo Go to tweet Cypress makes it possible to have the best of both worlds: a streamlined and stable testing infrastructure. Stefan Dili @DiliStefan Go to tweet @Cypress_io is by far the best DX tool I have encountered. Francesco Mugnai @francescomugnai Go to tweet @Cypress_io is an amazing tool. And the documentation is pure joy. It's like reading a great book...the more you read it, the more you love it. Thank you, @Cypress_io! Irina the nerd 🤓 @IrinaTheNerd Go to tweet I need a relaxing morning. I'll write some  @Cypress_io tests. #WomenWhoCode Gregoire Pineau @lyrixx Go to tweet I spend the last two days working with @Cypress_io: "A complete end-to-end testing experience" I'm **really** impressed by this project. We feel the DX is super important for them... And it just works© 👏👏👏 Yash Raj @mister_bourbon Go to tweet I'm awestruck with the power of  @Cypress_io. It makes the development and automation experience so awesome that you'll fall in love with it. With the updates more frequent than your sprint review, cypress is totally disrupting the market and is here to knock your socks off. Franck Grenier 🇪🇺🇺🇦 @franckgrenier Go to tweet Cypress is a real game changer in e2e testing. It runs inside 2 containers on our stack. The setup was almost easy and its adoption by the team was immediate. Now our test coverage is growing fast. Also mention the amazing test runner tool. @Cypress_io beats them all ! a-deal @adilconstantine Go to tweet Explaining to my 4 year old what I do for work & what automation is. So I showed him an automated @Cypress_io test & how its clicking and typing. Me: I made the computer do the work while my hands are not touching it My son: Oh so you can play with me while computer do work 😅 Sebastian Chwastek @s_chwastek Go to tweet @Cypress_io docs must be one of the best! 🤯 Well done. It has it all: learning course, real world examples, best practices, even FAQ is impressive (it has questions I didn't even know I wanted to ask). All open source too. Nico @2co_p Go to tweet Opened a pretty big PR to our project in Hyperjump but our comprehensive @Cypress_io tests make me confident it won't break anything.
