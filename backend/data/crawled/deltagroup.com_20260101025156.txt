LEARN MORE "Since we've made this change from our previous website vendor to Delta, we have seen a very large increase in traffic." Dean Rouso , Senior Vice President of Strategic Innovation Baird & Warner Real Estate "It has to do with the leadership of Delta too, their willingness to listen to what the needs of the companies are and then to create new products or make changes. And it's about the agent and what the agent needs to make their business better. And I think that Delta has a really good understanding of that." Whitney Finn-LaCosta , Broker/Owner Coach Realtors "We wanted more than just a vendor to help us launch a site, CRM and then vanish. We needed an ongoing partner to help us achieve our technology goals which we found in Delta. Now we are more of a technology forward brokerage, and Delta’s constant development of new tools helps us be competitive and offer a unique value."
