According to the forecast, economic growth is being driven mainly by government spending and a resurgence in exports. The experts are expecting GDP growth in 2027 and 2028 as well. Bundesbank’s Forecast for Germany: Economy will gradually recover © Nattanan Srisut / Adobe Stock The payments ecosystem in transition: Contactless payments and instant credit transfers on the rise 16.12.2025 Card payments are now the predominant form of electronic payment in Germany, as highlighted in the Bundesbank’s latest Monthly Report. The main driving forces behind the increased usage of cards as a means of payment have been the introduction of contactless technologies as well as changes in consumer behaviour as a result of the COVID - 19 pandemic. In the Monthly Report, the authors analyse current developments in the card market in Germany as well as other trends such as instant payments and mobile payments.

In this article, Bundesbank experts examine what cash acceptance is like in Germany and what challenges are involved.
