(Feb 6, 2002, 19:40 UTC) (8421 reads) (1 talkbacks) (Posted by )
"This article discusses a network setup where multiple webservers reside behind one IP address. Such a situation may arise when you need a specific webserver for one task and a different webserver for another task, running different operating systems or webserver software. With only one IP address available from the Internet, you could simply use Network Address Translation (NAT) with port forwarding. However, this forces you to give each webserver an ugly URL with a non-standard port number. Luckily, there is a better way. In the setup described in this article, each webserver can be reached via its own fully qualified domainname on the standard HTTP port (80)."

Apache Today Features

The Apache Web Server Documentation Project
Over the years, a lot of people have become interested in the idea of contributing to the Apache HTTP Server project, but have hung back or remained silent because they felt only hardcore C programmers with tons of experience need apply. Some actually have contacted the Project, saying they'd like to help out but don't have the coding skills and so didn't know what they could do. And some have offered specifically to help out on the documentation, either translating it, or correcting technical nits, or improving its readability or navigability. In July of 2000, however, the Apache HTTP server project created a subproject and reorganised the documentation files so that they can be worked on directly by non-programmers. This article describes more about this, and how you can get involved.
