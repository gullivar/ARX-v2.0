BY THE NUMBERS

By any measure, UMD stands among the preeminent universities in the country. We routinely appear at the top of rankings from U.S. News & World Report, Forbes, The Princeton Review and others. Our own counts—spanning facilities to faculty to Fulbright winners—make it even clearer: Maryland offers more. 

ACADEMICS

With over 100 undergraduate majors across 12 schools and colleges, we have at least one to match your interests, or can help you design your own. UMD also has one of the nation’s biggest and most robust graduate enterprises, housing more than 230 master’s, doctoral and certificate programs. Beyond innovative and engaging courses, students have infinite opportunities to learn beyond the classroom.
