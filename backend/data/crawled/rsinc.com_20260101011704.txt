Exploring Network Latency and Performance in Viasat Satellite Internet Understanding network latency is crucial when considering satellite internet services. Latency refers to the time it takes for a signal to travel from your device to the satellite in orbit, and then to the designated server and back again. Due to the vast distance that the signal must travel, satellite internet is often perceived to have higher latency compared to terrestrial internet options. The Implications of Latency in Satellite Internet Satellite internet, by its nature, involves longer transmission distances which can impact real-time online activities, such as online gaming or video conferencing. This is an inherent characteristic of satellite internet technology due to the geostationary orbit of satellites approximately 22,000 miles above the Earth. Viasat Internet and Latency Performance Viasat internet strives to deliver a different experience by continually improving their technology to enhance latency times. Through advanced algorithms and modernized infrastructure, Viasat works to minimize the delays typically associated with satellite internet.
