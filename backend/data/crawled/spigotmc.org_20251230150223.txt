Spigot & BungeeCord 1.21.11

Hi All

Mojang recently released Minecraft 1.21.11 and the first builds of Spigot for this version are now available. This is a generally minor release which predominantly focuses on adding new blocks, items and entities from the "Mounts of Mayhem" game drop, including the nautilus, zombie nautilus, nautilus armor, spears, netherite horse armor, camel husks, parched, and zombie horsemen.

Plugin Updates
Other than some changes to GameRule API, there are currently no significant API changes since 1.21.10. Other than in relation to removed GameRules (eg, doFireTick and allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer), no runtime breakages expected for plugins using non-deprecated, non-experimental API in this release. As always, plugins using the API should be preferred for this reason. As a server owner or developer please always consider the things you can do to increase API usage (eg, making feature or pull requests, preferring API-driven plugins). As we continue to work on making improvements to the API, there may be significant breakages of non-API plugins at any time. Further detail can be found in the below developer post.

Backups
Please make sure you have recent and tested backups for your server before upgrading. As always it is not possible to downgrade your server to an earlier version.

Bug Reports
If you are reporting a bug to JIRA, please make sure that you read the guidelines and have compared the results between Vanilla & Spigot, and also the 1.21.10 versions before reporting — this speeds up the process for us immensely and ensures more bugs get fixed more quickly. Please report bugs, or issues you think might be bugs, to JIRA and not in this thread, Discord, or any place other than JIRA. We prefer good quality but uncertain reports...

Hi All

Mojang recently released Minecraft 1.21.5 and the first builds of Spigot for this version are now available. This is a generally minor release which predominantly focuses on adding a small number of "Spring to Life" features to supplement the previous "winter drop".

Plugin Updates
There are currently no significant API changes since 1.21.4 and no runtime breakages expected for plugins using non-experimental API in this release. As always, plugins using the API should be preferred for this reason. As a server owner or developer please always consider the things you can do to increase API usage (eg, making feature or pull requests, preferring API-driven plugins).

Backups
Please make sure you have recent and tested backups for your server before upgrading. As always it is not possible to downgrade your server to an earlier version.

World Upgrading
Although upgrades from between any two version pairs are technically possible, it is recommended that all upgrades are conducted from 1.21.4. This means that you should first upgrade your world completely on 1.21.4 using the --forceUpgrade server argument, and then do the same on 1.21.5.

Bug Reports
If you are reporting a bug to JIRA, please make sure that you read the guidelines and have compared the results between Vanilla & Spigot, and also the 1.21.4 versions before reporting — this speeds up the process for us immensely and ensures more bugs get fixed more quickly.
