FAQs
What is a UGC platform?

A UGC platform is a technology-driven solution that enables brands to harness user-generated content (UGC) by streamlining the entire process—from creator recruitment, content creation, collection and licensing, through to repurposing that content across marketing channels. With this type of platform you can:

 

Identify, attract and engage UGC creators (customers, fans or influencers) and accept their request to contribute content.
Automate content intake, apply AI to tag, moderate or score submissions, and manage rights for reuse.
Distribute the approved UGC content across websites, social channels, ads and product pages.

 

At Skeepers, for example, the UGC platform supports UGC marketing initiatives by enabling brands to scale the use of UGC creators and automate the reuse of their assets. The result: you turn everyday real-user stories into brand assets that amplify trust and authenticity, while reducing production time and cost.

What are the benefits of user generated content?

User-generated content (UGC) offers multiple strategic benefits for brands because it delivers authentic, relatable stories from real people. When you integrate UGC into your marketing mix you gain:

Authenticity & trust – When consumers see others like them using your product, it drives credibility.
Increased engagement – UGC performs better in social feeds and draws more attention than purely brand-created visuals.
Conversion uplift – Incorporating UGC content into product pages, ads or emails improves conversion and drives sales.

 

SEO and content freshness – UGC adds diverse user language and long-tail keywords, boosting search visibility over time.

Cost efficiency – By leveraging content from UGC creators rather than creating everything in-house, you save resources and speed execution.

 

Skeepers emphasises these benefits in its UGC suite messaging — highlighting how brands turn UGC into growth levers using AI and automation.”

How can I effectively collect user-generated content for my brand?

Collecting UGC content effectively requires clearly defined processes, creator-friendly workflows and technology to support scale and reuse. Here’s how you can construct the process:
First, define what type of UGC you want (customer photos, video reviews, social stories) and craft a campaign brief that outlines prompts, themes, hashtags or guidelines.
Next, recruit UGC creators—either within your own customer base or through your creator community—and invite them to participate.
Then use a UGC platform (such as Skeepers) that automates submission intake, moderates content via AI, manages licensing, and integrates approved content into your marketing channels.
Finally, measure performance-metrics: how many submissions, how often is the content reused, how much conversion lift is generated. Use these insights to optimise your next UGC marketing campaign.
With this approach you move from ad-hoc UGC collection to a repeatable, scalable system that supports long-term growth.

How can I encourage my customers to create user-generated content?

To encourage customers to become UGC creators you must lower the barriers, make the experience motivating and clearly show how their content will be used. Start by sending targeted invitations such as post-purchase emails, social prompts or in-app notifications that invite customers to create content. Provide a simple creative brief or inspiration of what you’re looking for, suggest captions, hashtags or the ideal format. Offer rewards or recognition: feature top pieces on your channels, give discounts, run contests or highlight creators in community posts. Ensure copyright and licensing are clear so customers feel comfortable sharing their content. Use a UGC platform like Skeepers to manage the process end-to-end—from content creation, to collection to reuse. When customers see their content valued and reused, they feel recognized and are more likely to engage again. Over time this builds a pipeline of UGC creators who support your brand storytelling in authentic ways.
