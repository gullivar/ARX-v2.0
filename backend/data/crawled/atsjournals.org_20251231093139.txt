DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION

The ATS encourages diversity, equity, and inclusion for its journal authors, editors, and reviewers. This is especially important for those groups that have been historically under-represented in these areas. Bringing in diverse perspectives across disciplines, training levels, and identities has the potential to broaden the applicability and reach of our mission and activities and is known to improve overall scientific rigor and quality.

Racial, Ethnic, Sex, and Gender Equity for Inclusive Interstitial Lung Disease Research: An Official American Thoracic Society Research Statement

IL-33 Induces a Protective Response against Irritant-induced Airway Inflammation and Dysfunction
The expansion of ILCs by IL-33 was demonstrably protective against airway dysfunction and neutrophilic airway inflammation after Cl2 exposure. The protection was attributable to ILC2s and was mediated, at least in part, by IL-13 production. The protection was also dependent on macrophages. However, the precise molecular mechanism of protection afforded by the macrophage phenotype induced by IL-33 and IL-13 secreted from the expanded ILC2 subset requires further study.

Rural-Urban Patterns in Household Rules Limiting Combustible Tobacco, Noncombustible Tobacco, and E-Cigarette Use
Rural and small-town Americans were more likely than urban respondents to allow household use of all tobacco product types. This pattern persisted when adjusted for socioeconomic factors and respondent product use. These findings may help address tobacco-related diseases that disproportionately affect rural Americans.
