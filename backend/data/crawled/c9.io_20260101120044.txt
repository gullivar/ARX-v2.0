AWS Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since your AWS Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine. AWS Cloud9 also provides a seamless experience for developing serverless applications, allowing you to easily define resources, debug, and switch between local and remote execution of serverless applications. With AWS Cloud9, you can quickly share your development environment with your team, enabling you to pair-program and track each other's inputs in real time. Benefits Code with just a browser AWS Cloud9 gives you the flexibility to run your development environment on a managed Amazon EC2 instance or any existing Linux server that supports SSH. This means that you can write, run, and debug applications with just a browser, without needing to install or maintain a local IDE.
