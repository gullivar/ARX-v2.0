Bhilai – Chhattisgarh As a practicing Chartered Accountant, I’ve been using **Tally Prime** for several clients’ accounting and GST compliance requirements over the past few years. Tally has proven to be one of the most dependable tools for managing day-to-day bookkeeping, preparing GST returns, and ensuring accuracy in compliance CA Swarnim Rai M/s R Rishi and Associates
                            Bhopal, MP With Tally Prime’s direct GSTR‑1 upload feature, our compliance time has shrunk dramatically.
                        Before switching to Tally Prime’s GSTR-1 upload workflow, our team manually exported data,
                        logged into the portal, uploaded files, checked for rejections, and handled correction loops—and
                        it consumed half a day every month. What once took a half-day now takes only an hour. Highly
                        recommend this to any business using Tally for GST filing. CA Uttam Chand CNK Associates LLP, Mumbai – Heading the Chennai Branch TallyPrime now helps in filing various returns and reconciling all the GST returns filed with
                        tally data, like GSTR3B, GSTR1, 2B v/s Input claimed, 2A v/s Input claimed, IMS direct upload,
                        etc. with so much ease. CA Sridhar Andhavarapu Chairman, ICAI- Vizag Branch Another amazing feature “Upload GST Returns” in TallyPrime- Upload the GSTR-1 directly to the
                        GST portal without login to the portal, which can then be previewed and filed using EVC or

                        avoid upload errors. CA Chetan Kishor Joshi With the latest TallyPrime update, we were able to file GSTR-1 more confidently without
                        rechecking exports. CA Ashish Kanabar A B Kanabar and Associates I recently filed GSTR-1 seamlessly through TallyPrime. It significantly helped reduce manual
