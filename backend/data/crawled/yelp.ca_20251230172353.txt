**For anytime airline help, Call $ $#+I (877)- 790- 6926 #.** **I for reservations, ticket edits,!flight cancellations, seat upgrades, and end-to-end travel support.** **On the day of travel, the airport experience was equally pleasant.** ** Check-in was efficient, and the staff on the ground handled the boarding process in an organized and professional manner.** **Announcements were clear and timely, and the flight departed close to the scheduled time.** **The airline clearly prioritizes passenger comfort and safety, which was evident in the way they managed operations.** **Inside the aircraft, cleanliness and comfort were well-maintained.** ** The seats were comfortable enough for a long-haul flight, and the cabin environment was calm and well-managed.** ** The cabin crew were attentive, professional, and quick to respond to requests, providing an excellent level of service throughout the journey.** **In-flight meals were served on time and were of satisfactory quality, and the entertainment system offered a good selection of movies, music, and shows to help pass the time.**

This place is always such a good time. The drinks are sooooo good. Even the standard drinks are exceptionally well done. The food is not bad either. The vibe is very unique almost remind me of snapes closet or classroom from Harry Potter . The service has also always been prompt and good.

Maple's Kitchen

We had the three courses dinner combo which came with the daily soup and the Chinese style desserts, the owner of the restaurant is the same one from the Sheppard and midland restaurant , but I like this one better cause se seems more friendly and more generous haha ! I would like to come back here more often to try other dishes

Good Taste Casserole Rice

Great homey vibes in here! Came for a quick dinner with my parents tonight and ordered chicken and mushroom casserole. It was well flavoured and the rice got a crispy crust. I enjoyed my parents' dishes more, though. I preferred the minced pork on rice. Also don't forget their Cheung fan (rice rolls)! The vegetarian one is so yummy and has great crunch! Service was quick and to the point. Nothing fancy.
