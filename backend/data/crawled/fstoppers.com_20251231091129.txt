Take your entire studio with you if you wish. Have a flight to a remote location and can’t rent equipment? The Think Tank Production Manager 50 has you covered. It is the bag to end all bags. 0 December 30, 2025 by Alex Cooke Recover Blown Highlights in Interior Shots Without Making Them Look Fake Side-by-side windows can make an interior image look sloppy even when the room lighting feels controlled, because each pane can land in a different world of exposure and color. You see it most when one window has a screen and the other does not or when an open pane overlaps a closed one and the tones stop matching. Here's how to handle them.

Nonetheless, the tradeoffs matter, especially if you shoot fast action, rely on an EVF, or expect long, uninterrupted takes. 0 December 30, 2025 by Alex Cooke Why This Popular Fast Fifty Struggles on Modern Sensors Old lenses feel familiar until you bolt them onto a modern sensor and see what they really do. If a fast fifty is part of your kit, the gap between “good memories” and “good files” can get expensive fast. 1 December 29, 2025 by Steven Van Worth Film Prices Are Out of Control: How to Keep Shooting Without Going Broke Film prices aren’t creeping up anymore; they’re sprinting. 9 December 29, 2025 by Alex Cooke Teleconverter vs. Crop: Everything You Need to Know to Get the Best Photos Every wildlife or sports photographer knows the feeling. You've hiked three miles into a marsh, the golden hour light is perfect, and a great blue heron is hunting in the shallows. Then you look at your LCD and realize the bird occupies maybe 400 pixels of your frame. You need more reach, but your 600mm lens might as well be a 300mm for the shot you actually want. This is the focal length wall, and it's a universal frustration that unites wildlife shooters, sports photographers, and aviation enthusiasts alike. 4 December 29, 2025 by Illya Ovchar Can Capture One’s New Retouching Tools Replace Photoshop? Capture One recently came out with a pretty significant update, making retouching as well as organizing your digital assets a lot easier. With the new update, you can make pretty impressive adjustments to people’s faces without ever having to open Photoshop. But just how impressive are they? I tested it on my own images. 3 December 29, 2025 by Michael Rudzikewycz Catherine Leroy: A Combat Photographer’s Journey Catherine Leroy was a highly influential photojournalist in the twentieth century whose work fundamentally helped shape visual understandings of the Vietnam War. During the war, events were reported and viewed as strategic or abstract; however, her work presented the war as an immediate human experience characterized by the subject’s vulnerability, exhaustion, and the moral complexity of the conflict. 1 December 29, 2025 by Alex Cooke How This Long Exposure Feature Never Blows the Highlights Long exposures can feel like a tug of war between time, light, and patience. If your camera can build the effect in-camera while you watch it happen, you stop guessing and start deciding. 3 December 29, 2025 by Alex Cooke DJI Might Disappear From U.S. Shelves: Here’s the Drone That Looks Like the Best Alternative A looming shift in what drones you can buy in the U.S. forces a choice you probably have been delaying. If you rely on aerial shots to set location, scale, or motion, losing access to your default upgrade path changes how you plan shoots and travel kits. 0 December 29, 2025 by Alex Cooke Making Strong Minimal Photos in Busy, Overdone Locations Minimal photography gets easier when someone shows the decisions, not just the results. This video teaches a repeatable way to build clean frames under time pressure, even when the tide is moving faster than expected. 0 December 29, 2025 by Alex Cooke The Lightroom Object Selection Trick That Beats “Select Subject” A clean subject mask can make the difference between a shot that looks alive and a subject that looks pasted onto the frame. When Lightroom grabs the branch, the background, and half the subject in one sloppy selection, your edit turns into cleanup work instead of creative control. 19 December 28, 2025 by Alex Cooke How to Break Up With Adobe in 2026: The Subscription-Free Creative Suite The subscription fatigue is real. Every month, the same charges appear on your credit card statement, a persistent reminder that you're renting the tools of your trade rather than owning them. For many photographers and video creators, this model feels fundamentally wrong. The camera in your bag belongs to you. Your lenses belong to you. Why shouldn't your software? 0 December 28, 2025 by Alex Cooke Living With the Ricoh GR IV After 5,000 Shots Pocket cameras live or die on speed, handling, and whether they earn a place in your daily routine. The Ricoh GR IV sits right in that pressure zone, where small design choices and real-world behavior matter more than headline specs. 16 December 28, 2025 by Alvin Greis Should you Strengthen Your Photographs With a Thoughtful Title? Many photographers struggle with the simple act of giving their work a title. Some of us reduce the title to a literal description, while others choose a poetic word that adds nothing. In both cases, the title stops supporting the image and becomes a formality, and avoiding titles altogether leads to the same issue. Here, I outline the common mistakes and a few practical ways a title can guide the viewer’s first steps into the photograph. 1 December 28, 2025 by Alex Cooke Your New Camera Might Be Holding You Back Buying a new camera can quietly make your photos worse, even if the specs are better. The problem is not your taste or your ambition, it is the gap between what the camera can do and what you can run without thinking. 2 December 28, 2025 by Alex Cooke Tamron 25-200mm G2 vs Sigma 20-200mm: The Right All-in-One Zoom for Travel Packing one lens for a trip sounds smart until you get home and realize you missed half the shots you wanted. A travel zoom that starts wide, reaches long, and stays light changes how you plan, shoot, and move through a place. 0 December 28, 2025 by Alex Cooke Laowa 35mm f/2.8 Zero-D Tilt-Shift 0.5x Macro Lens Review: What You Gain and What You Give Up Tilt-shift lenses stop being mysterious once you see what the controls actually do, and where the tradeoffs show up in real files. If you shoot buildings, interiors, products, or stitched landscapes, a 35mm tilt-shift option can solve problems that are hard to fix later, especially when you care about straight lines and consistent detail across the frame. 5 December 27, 2025 by Alex Cooke Viltrox Is Following the Sigma Playbook (And Why You Should Pay Attention) If you have been paying attention to the third-party lens market over the last two years, you have probably experienced a strange sense of déjà vu. A scrappy manufacturer from outside the traditional power structure starts releasing surprisingly competent glass at prices that make the establishment nervous. The photography forums fill with skeptics insisting that something must be wrong, that corners must have been cut, that you get what you pay for. And then, slowly, the narrative shifts. The skeptics become converts. The budget option becomes the smart option. The disruptor becomes the new normal. 2 December 27, 2025 by Alex Cooke Can Affinity Beat Photoshop? Switching away from Photoshop sounds tempting until you hit the parts of editing that punish you for being slow or slightly sloppy. If you shoot in rough light, push exposure hard, or do regular cleanup work, the gap between “good enough” and “clean” shows up fast. 28 December 27, 2025 by Simon Burn The One Thing Your Travel Photos Are Missing One of the most enjoyable genres of photography is travel photography. Who doesn’t love to travel to interesting and exotic foreign destinations and wander around with a camera? It’s great to return home with a collection of images that capture your adventure—images you can show people that give them an idea of where you visited and what you experienced. 10 December 27, 2025 by Alex Cooke Stop Arguing Zoom vs Prime and Pick What Fits Your Shooting Choosing between zooms and primes is not a gear argument, it’s a working method decision that shows up in your keeper rate and your stress level. If you shoot travel, landscapes, or people on the move, the wrong lens choice turns into missed frames and constant second-guessing. 1 December 27, 2025 by Alex Cooke How To Get Better Astrophotos Without Upgrading Anything Ten years into shooting deep space, the biggest shifts are not in your gear bag, they are in how you practice, judge progress, and stay motivated when results are messy. If you want better night-sky images without getting trapped in comparison spirals or tech paralysis, this video lays out a sharper path. 0 December 27, 2025 by Alex Cooke Viltrox 9mm f/2.8 Air: Real-World Pros and Cons Ultra-wide primes are tricky: they can look dramatic, but they also expose every weakness in your technique and your lens. If you shoot Sony E, Fujifilm X, or Nikon Z APS-C and want a small lens at a cheap price, this one should be on your radar. 0 December 26, 2025 by Lee Morris Saramonic Air Review: Cheaper and Better Sounding Today, I put the incredibly small Saramonic Air up against the current industry favorite, the DJI Mic 2, to see how it really stacks up. The results will surprise you. 15 December 26, 2025 by Alex Cooke 10 Songs About Photography You Can Listen To Photography and music share a common purpose: capturing moments, preserving memories, and evoking emotions that words alone cannot express. It should come as no surprise, then, that musicians have long been drawn to the camera as a subject for their songs. Whether exploring the nostalgia of old prints, the ethical weight of documentary photography, or the modern phenomenon of the selfie, these tracks span decades and genres while keeping the photographic image at their core. From indie darlings to pop icons, here are 10 songs that put photography center stage. 0 December 26, 2025 by Alex Cooke The $55 Instant Camera That Forces You to Stop Overthinking Instant cameras sound simple until you’re the one paying for each frame and guessing exposure with no screen. This video walks through a instax bundle that looks basic on purpose, and that’s exactly why it can change how you shoot on a night out. 21 December 26, 2025 by Zhen Siang Yang When Does Using Crop Mode Really Make Sense? In my previous article , where I discussed how square sensor format might reshape how we compose and shoot and how it could possibly help push digital cameras into their next evolution cycle in the future, the idea is great, but there are still currently no camera manufacturers in the mirrorless camera realm that are willing to take the risk and experiment with this idea. Meanwhile, what we do have on hand in every modern full frame camera is the Super 35 or APS-C crop mode. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 … Follow Fstoppers Support Fstoppers Articles Latest News Gear Reviews Fstoppers Originals Community Editors' Picks Photo of the Day Discussion Groups Photography Contests Store Photography Tutorials Photoshop Plugins About About Fstoppers Contact Us Advertise FAQs ©2025 Fstoppers Terms and Conditions | Privacy Policy
