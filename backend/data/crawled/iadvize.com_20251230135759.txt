What is an AI Shopping Assistant?
An AI Shopping Assistant engages shoppers using sales-first AI that delivers real-time guidance, personalized product recommendations, and proactive answers to critical buying questions.

Your 30-day free trial gives you access to our AI Shopping Assistant on your product detail pages (PDPs). It includes up to 3,000 AI-handled conversations and supports up to 10,000 SKUs. It’s the fastest way to see impact — no credit card required.

Security is a core pillar of the iAdvize platform. We are fully GDPR-compliant and ISO 27001 certified, ensuring that your data—and your customers’—is handled with the highest standards of privacy and protection.
