IZA combines its global network of over 2,000 distinguished economists from 60 countries and a group of dedicated researchers in its local campus in Bonn, Germany. This collaborative effort of IZA’s network and its local team fosters an inclusive and highly productive research environment that contributes to bridging the gap between scientific inquiry and societal impact. IZA’s scholarly activities are coordinated by Research Director Florian Zimmermann , supported by a Network Advisory Panel which represents a range of diverse viewpoints and constituencies, including a mix of different seniorities within the profession.
