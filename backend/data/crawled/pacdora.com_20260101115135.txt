Downloadable files are supported by multiple softwares, can be easily adjusted and all of their online tools are user-friendly and easy to find. Would love to have even more box-design options soon! I'm already suggesting the website to fellow designers! Natali Sep 10, 2024 Great website, easy to use and get the dielines in all files you need for every type and shape of box. Customer service also very helpful! 杰克·德布 2024年8月15日 I loved the service of Pacdora.com, this is mind blowing website and very easy to convert your packaging design in mockups. Sandip Bhadaniya Aug 09, 2024 Great mock-ups and literally thousands of packaging designs to choose from. The 3d mock-up is so good, helps bring clarity to the client as well as the designers. Great product for packaging design professionals. Pran Sriv Jul 19, 2024 I'm a graphic design student and find Pacdora extremely helpful when mocking up projects. The convenience of Pacdora allows me to spend more time on designing rather than figuring out all the technical nuances in building dielines. Highly recommend Pacdora. AM May 17, 2024 excellent platform for creators and packaging developers. It is users friendly and also compatible with various software platforms. I request you to add some more box packaging concepts which I have wrote in mail. More over at the time of job assembling time we needs dieline in male female locking pattern to save the paper that command is missing. In other words job assembler as per sheet size. Nautam Ladia May 10, 2024 Great variety of boxes, the costumer service is fast and helpful and the online design software is so easy to use, pretty happy with it. Argenta Bakery May 24, 2024 The best mockup and 3D simulation app I've tried. Amir Ori Kerbis May 16, 2024 My god this software is a game changer. As a graphic designer with some 3D knowledge this is absolutely a time saver and super easy to use and get great results fast. Very impressed with the initial customization that can be applied. Granted this is a test run for me as haven't subscribed yet I can say if I had known about this software I would have used it on many previous clients for getting them an idea for products in a packaging setting. Brandon Oltman May 08, 2024 I tried Pacdora to design the product package and inside collaterals the tool provided me all what I need in one place, it is very simple to be used, and the option to share the design with others and enable them to visualize it in 3d shape, animate the design is really added value to my end product design, Thank You Pacdora team. Haitham Elshaikh Apr 07, 2024 I love using Pacdora! They make bringing any packaging design to life so easy. I love how easy it is to use and how much variety there is in the mockups and dielines. Samantha Glassman Mar 26, 2024 We are using it to generate dielines and packaging mockups. I love the minimalist & intuitive user interface. It is clean and well thought. Based on the outer packaging dimensions, cardboard thickness and type, you can generate the die line and import it in Illustrator. Great software for product development.
