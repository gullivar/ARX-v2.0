                    gallery Bedroom Bathroom Basement Living room Laundry room Common questions from scoopers Common questions from scoopers Will my cat actually use it? Cats are generally curious and will investigate any new object. Cats that are already used to a covered litter box may be quicker to investigate. We recommend that you leave Litter-Robot turned off at first while your cat acclimates. Place Litter-Robot in the same location as the old litter box. You can leave the old litter box near Litter-Robot for a short time. Take a cup of litter from the old litter box and add it to the clean litter in Litter-Robot. The scent will be familiar, and your cat will be inclined to investigate. Once your cat ventures inside and feels the litter under their paws, they will know what to do. Learn more about acclimating your cat . *Will Litter-Robot eliminate all litter box odors? Because waste is promptly removed and contained in the base, typical litter box odors will be significantly reduced with Litter-Robot. Litter-Robot 5 and Litter-Robot 5 Pro feature WasteID™—an industry-first technology that distinguishes between urine and feces for targeted odor control—a sealed waste drawer, and a Carbon Filter to reduce odors. You can opt to combine the Carbon Filter with OdorTrap® Packs to eliminate litter box odors through natural chemistry. We also recommend using an unscented, all-natural litter like GreatLitter to help with odor control. Does Litter-Robot require special litter? Litter-Robot simply requires clumping litter. We recommend a high-quality, standard-weight, clay-based clumping litter, such as our GreatLitter . Some silica gel litter beads and crystals can also be used with Litter-Robot, as long as they pass through the screen. Alternative, plant-based litters may also work, but these tend to form looser clumps that can cause condensation in the waste drawer. When using a plant-based litter, we recommend emptying the waste drawer and cleaning more frequently. Litters that do not work in Litter-Robot are the strictly absorbent, non-clumping or loose-clumping litters, newspaper-based litters, and absorbent wood pellet litter. Will the globe turn on while my cat is inside? No, the globe will not turn while your cat is inside. Litter-Robot features weight sensor technology that detects your cat every time they enter, or re-enter, the globe, resetting the countdown timer to prevent the clean cycle from starting for another 7 minutes.
