Welcome to ConnectSci News

Cosmos Magazine’s online news service has migrated to ConnectSci News to increase its reach and impact. Here are some of the top searches of the Cosmos archive:

The Bronze Age
Covid-19
The Romans
Varroa Mite
Voyager 2

 

You can also search our content.

For 20 years, Cosmos Magazine inspired curiosity and made science accessible to everyone. It was a trusted source of fact-based content that has attracted a large audience from across the globe. More than 4000 Cosmos online news articles will be transferred to the new platform. ConnectSci News will remain editorially independent.

The Cosmos archive is available via search. We apologise if the article you are looking for is unavailable. The rest of the archive is stored offline and will be reviewed. We will publish new content every day at Connect Sci News, bookmark our new home page connectsci.au/news

Journalists with work previously commissioned and published by Cosmos are welcome to contact Gavin Stone with any queries.
