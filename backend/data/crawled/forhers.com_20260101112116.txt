What is Hers?

Hers is a 100% online platform with over 2 million subscribers that connects patients to licensed healthcare professionals in all 50 states. We offer support for weight loss, hair regrowth, mental health, and skincare.




Through our simple online process you can connect with licensed medical providers who can recommend customized treatment plans including prescription treatments, if appropriate, shipped right to your door.

How does Hers work?

First, complete an online intake form to give your healthcare provider information about your symptoms and medical history. Then, a licensed provider will assess that information and determine the right treatment option for you. For states that require a video or audio visit, you'll be offered available times and dates to schedule your online visit. For states that don't, a provider will send your treatment recommendation to your chat inbox.




If your provider determines treatment is right for you, it’s delivered in discreet packaging to your shipping address.

Who are the providers at Hers?

Providers through Hers are physicians, nurse practitioners, psychiatrists, dermatologists, and pharmacists. They’re licensed in all 50 states and DC, and offer safe, high-quality, evidence-based treatment and care.

Does Hers require insurance?

Nope! Hers doesn’t require insurance. We offer transparent pricing on treatments and your medical visit, ongoing shipments, and provider messaging are all included in one low price.

What states is Hers available in?

Hers is currently available in all 50 states and Washington, DC.

Are Hers ingredients sourced in the US?

The ingredients we use are carefully researched and sourced in order to make sure that they are high quality: we verify that each active ingredient complies with specifications set by the United States Pharmacopeia — an independent, not-for-profit organization that sets quality and safety standards for medicine. We test formulations with a third-party analytical laboratory, ensuring that the potency and strength in the formulation is as labeled.
