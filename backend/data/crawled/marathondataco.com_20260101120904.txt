Let's Chat Web Merchandising and CRO Smart analytics that guide e–commerce traffic where it matters most Most brands see declining revenue per session, often because adding more products and features makes it harder for users to find what they want. The result? Less revenue and missed opportunities. Improving site usability has a clear, measurable ROI. Instead of blaming Meta’s algorithm for slow growth, focus on optimizing your site. If your revenue per session matched last year’s, your business would perform significantly better. You’re investing heavily to attract visitors — don’t waste it.

We balance brand building and monetization, guide tests, allocate capital and sustain growth. brand lifecycle We're building Marathon for companies that realize they need to change Stage 1 🚀 Everything is working effortlessly Growth is strong, ROAS is high, and new customers keep coming in with minimal effort. Customer acquisition costs stay low, contribution margins are healthy, and revenue from discounting is minimal. The biggest challenge is simply keeping up with demand while scaling without losing quality. Stage 2  🌊 Riding the Wave The brand is still growing, but small cracks begin to show. Sales remain strong, yet acquisition costs are starting to creep upward. Margins dip slightly, and discounting becomes a bit more frequent. The focus shifts to sustaining momentum while preventing over–reliance on promotions and protecting profitability. Stage 3 😐 The Plateau Growth slows and acquiring customers becomes expensive. Marketing spend rises sharply while revenue growth flattens. Margins drop, and a significant portion of sales now depends on discounts. The goal is to reduce discount dependency, improve contribution margins, and strike a better balance between paid and owned media channels. Stage 4 🏆 Sustainable Growth Acquisition costs come back under control, margins improve, and discounting stabilizes at a healthy level. The brand can now grow profitably without leaning too heavily on promotions. The ongoing challenge is maintaining financial discipline and continuing to scale without sacrificing brand integrity or long–term profitability.

In the early days at Chubbies we built Brand because we had to. We had no money. We were scrappy, creative, dynamic. And we built an awesome Brand. Then we monetized that Brand with performance DR. We convinced ourselves that that was the source of our growth. We almost went out of business. We righted the ship and built, brick by brick, to a >$100m exit, culminating in a >$1B IPO , but to do that we had to overcome the overwhelming pressure to take a short–termist approach. As we've seen this direct–to–consumer brand market evolve over the years, we've seen the same cycle happen to nearly every other business out there: Starting hot, pushing performance marketing, then stalling out and never getting to long-term sustainable growth. This was the problem we felt absolutely compelled to solve because we felt for these brand builders and entrepreneurs. We were in their shoes. And but for a whole lotta luck and a gritty–a** team, it would have sunk us. Then we looked around and realized there just isn't anything on the market that helps companies do this — this most important thing imaginable. So that's what we're working towards, would love your feedback. Tom CEO @ Marathon Co–founder @ Chubbies Preston President @ Marathon Co–founder @ Chubbies WHY BRAND? Brands are moats. What we're trying to do is find a business with a wide and long–lasting moat around it, protecting a terrific economic castle. In essence, that's what business is all about. Warren Buffett American Investor A great brand, meaningful to consumers will outlast the marketing spend. Dave Powers CEO of Deckers Brands, owner of HOKA and UGG Brand and activation work in synergy, each enhancing the other. Brand communications create enduring memory structures that increase the base level of demand and reduce price sensitivity. Les Binet Author of The Long and the Short of it People largely use their memories when buying, rather than searching. Simply put, the brand that gets remembered is the brand that gets bought John Dawes Ehrenberg–Bass Institute I think probably our most important piece of intellectual property is our brand name Jeff Bezos Founder of Amazon Our goal is to increase the probability that the brand comes to mind when the buyer goes in–market, not to persuade the buyer to go in market. You can’t push buyers down a funnel, but you can catch buyers as they fall Jenni Romaniuk Ehrenberg–Bass Institute our model How Marathon model works By tapping in the most talented data scientists in the world to work on this problem, that's just what we've done. Our model maps hundreds of millions of digital brand behaviors to billions of dollars of baseline revenue to find the strongest, most statistically sound relationships and bring them to you in the form of real baseline dollars to your business. Ordinarily, a model of this magnitude would cost a Fortune 500 company on the order of $50m+, but because we are using a digital measure of brand, and because our model gets better with every single customer we add to the platform, we can bring it to you for effectively 0% of that cost. Just like your business, the volume of these behaviors varies widely over time. And when you look across many businesses across many different industries, you can start to build a very sophisticated model for the relationship between changes in the volumes and degree of digital brand behaviors and growth in the resilient revenue of any given business. Brand Measurement: The Traditional Approach vs. Marathon Methodology 📊 Marathon Behavioral — directly representative of memory–driving actions users take towards your business Traditional Survey–based = survey bias, dirty data, misaligned incentives of survey takers Scale 📊 Marathon Hundreds of millions of brand–oriented behaviors tracked and counting Traditional Survey sample size — typically in the thousands, extrapolated to populations 300m+ Speed 📊 Marathon Daily results for 2y+ historical Traditional Quarterly, Semi–Annual, or Annual survey results most common — no historical record optimizable 📊 Marathon Daily/Weekly/Monthly results give you new top–level metric to optimize in real–time. Connection to digital behaviors gives accountability to specific marketing tactics and creative. Traditional Test for 6 months, hope you moved the survey results — no accountability to any tactic Accountable 📊 Marathon Based in ROI on your business and verified across our entire Marathon dataset — Billions of dollars of baseline revenue and hundreds of millions of brand behaviors Traditional No accountability to speak of except at the highest echelons of Fortune 500 with price tags in the $Millions Testable 📊 Marathon We start with a Marathon–financed 6–month incrementality study to ensure growth in the metrics that matter Traditional Not at all Partner with Marathon for balanced growth Talk to our team about building brand, monetizing demand and growing revenue.
