Frequently asked questions What is the difference between Shared Hosting and VPS Hosting? Our Shared Hosting packages offer your growing business a cost-effective solution where multiple websites share the same server resources, such as CPU (Central Processing Unit) and RAM (Random-access-memory). It's ideal for smaller websites with lower traffic and minimal resource needs.

Are your Shared Hosting resources no longer sufficient? Our VPS Hosting packages come with plenty of disk space and enough bandwidth to grow! Your VPS will have its own hosting space and resources, increasing performance and speed.

Although multiple websites still share a physical server, your website operates independently with guaranteed resources. Your VPS will have its own hosting space and resources, increasing performance and speed. This option ensures scalability and control at an affordable price, making it perfect for websites with higher traffic demands. How do I transfer my website to 1-grid? To transfer your website to 1-grid, follow these simple steps:

1.	Backup Your Website: Ensure you have a full backup of your website files and databases.
2.	Transfer Your Domain: If you want to move your domain to 1-grid, initiate a domain transfer through your current registrar and update your DNS settings.
