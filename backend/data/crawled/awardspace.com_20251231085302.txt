There are multiple reasons for that. For starters, the domain name that one might have had in their mind might be already registered. If so, there are a few approaches to overcome this unpleasant situation. You can try buying the domain, which is rarely worth it, exceptions do exist, of course.  On the other hand, you could figure out another name for your future website. Another reason for the importance of the name is that it sometimes limits or broadens the intended applications of your website and/or brand. A name, too neutral might leave your website users expecting more, but on the other hand, a too specific name of your website and brand might restrict the expected services that you provide. Of course, nothing could stop you from offering whatever services you choose, but it is hard to imagine that one could find a website-building service on a domain called “dog-hotel.com”. Choose your website name today. Check domain availability One-Click CMS Installation In order for you to start building your website as soon as possible, not only your AwardSpace hosting account will be activated immediately, but you’ll be able to use our proprietary one-click CMS Zacky Installer. Naturally, WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, OpenCart, and PrestaShop are available. Yet, so are other content management systems like Moodle, MediaWiki, osCommerce, phpBB, Grav, Concrete5 And still other great software like SuiteCRM, VTiger, SimpleMachines, etc. Get Started Choose a Web Hosting Plan We understand that you are just looking for a solution that will just work.

Hosting knowledge base WordPress is probably the most versatile content management system in existence. Naturally, it is the most used and famous CMS. It makes the process of website building accessible to everyone.
The development of the CMS through the years made it actually possible and more often than not recommendable for one to create their own website, instead of paying someone to do it for them.

When you go to the tutorials page you’ll be able to give us feedback on whether the tutorial is what you expected, or you need more information.

Honestly, it depends. There are millions of websites in the world, and each of them is, in one way or another, unique. There are unifying factors like whether you are using CMS, like WordPress for example, or you are creating everything from scratch. If you are using a CMS, it might take you from a few hours to a few days to create the website. Check out our full guide on how to create a website with WordPress and build your first website for a few hours. What is the fastest and easiest way to create a website? That’s an easy question. WordPress. WordPress is by far the fastest and easiest way to build your first website. Check out our WordPress tutorials to see how easy it is to create and maintain a website with WordPress What is web hosting and why I need it? Web hosting is an online service that can power your website. When you get a web hosting plan, you will essentially rent a small portion of a professional web server. You can then upload your website onto the server to make it accessible worldwide. What does "free hosting" mean? Unlike many other service providers that are using the term “free hosting” as a hook, where they mean “3 months” free if you commit for a year usage, AwardSpace’s free hosting service is actually free. When we use the term “free hosting” we mean exactly that. Free of charge. No ads and no credit card needed. We are not asking you for commitment to buy anything nor to upgrade your plan down the road. You can use our free hosting forever. It is truly free hosting . What is a domain name? The domain name acts as an easy-to-remember address for your site. When you wish to visit a specific website, you would type its domain name in your browser’s address bar. As an example, AwardSpace uses the “awardspace.com” domain name. What is the difference between a domain and hosting? Hosting refers to the Internet service that allows you to put a site online while the domain provides a memorable address so others can easily visit your website. You can think of the domain as a street address, hosting as the land lot that corresponds to the address, and the website as the building that you have constructed on that lot. Looking for a risk-free start? Look no further. As a free web hosting pioneer, AwardSpace provides a completely risk-free environment for you to create your first website. No credit card is needed.
