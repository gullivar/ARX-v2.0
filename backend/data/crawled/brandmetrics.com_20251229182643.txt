Why is brand lift important?

Advertisers deserve to know how their campaign has worked, but if it is not measured, how can anyone be sure?

Relying on blunt performance metrics is not the answer, the industry needs a more nuanced view of the whole funnel effect. Every time.

Consistent brand lift measurement provides a simple, scalable way to measure the effect of every campaign on brand perceptions.

”Brand Metrics' data-driven strategies have enabled us to identify and seize new revenue opportunities. They have truly become an invaluable partner in our business.”

- The Guardian

”We're incredibly excited about the new developments at Brand Metrics and how these advancements will create new commercial opportunities for Bloomberg Media across the region.”

- Bloomberg
How we are different
No panels

We measure 'in the wild' where campaign exposure took place. No sample bias, no lab settings, no claimed campaign exposure.

No cost per measurement

Our SaaS solution offers unlimited measurements for a single monthly fee. We believe in democratising campaign measurement.

No long surveys

We provide four consistent metrics - awareness, consideration, preference and intent - from a single survey question.

No 3rd party cookies

Our GDPR compliant technology integrates directly with publisher sites and avoids using 3rd party cookies.

Optimising future outcomes
Brand Metrics’ database provides independent proof of your past effectiveness but also enables a forward-looking role.
Compare your results to benchmarks, combine with 1st party data, test new formats and segments, build data into planning tools.
The more data you have, the more you can use your insights proactively to optimise for more effective future campaigns.
