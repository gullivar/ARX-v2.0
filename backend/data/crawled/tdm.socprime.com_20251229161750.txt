TDM is really easy to use. I like the filtration of content, it's really easy to find what's needed from the dozens of rules. What is more helpful for us in day-to-day work - mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK framework that halps in uncovering the latest threats.

A good support in our project of migration from one SIEM to another.
Sep 16, 2020

At organisation, we are in the process of migrating from one SIEM technology to another one. This was an opportunity to review the use case library and to develop them following well-known framework such as MITRE ATT&CK. Using SOC Prime Platform helps to quickly identify use cases related to the technologies to monitor and the tactics, techniques and procedures of the attackers. TDM helps us to make more effective security monitoring rules, to port them to the new platform and eventually to reduce the time to prod of the use cases.

TDM success story
May 24, 2020

We have been using TDM for 2 years. The company provides a great service, qualified support and personal approach. Before choosing TDM, we were actually looking for a solution to cover our security content needs and improve detection capabilities. TDM has covered these needs and moreover saved time to our SOC team. For the past year they became even better and more mature in content quality and quantity. I think they can improve even more by adding some industry specific content, but still it's a good value for money anyway.

Apr 16, 2020

The company has very knowledgable staff and the TDM platform provides a plethora of great threat definitions and IOCs. I think SOC prime could do better from a QA standpoint as many of the rules don't work out of the box and require some fine tuning.

Aiming to gain the maximum of the Information Security department, the Bank reached out to SOC Prime for consulting and finally bought a subscription for the SOC Prime Platform for sharing analytical content. The subscription enabled us to significantly decrease workload of the department employees for creating the analytical content, and put their efforts into investigation of the detected incidents. New valid use cases and detection queries are continuously added to TDM, which gives us an opportunity to minimize time for detection and mitigation of threats.
