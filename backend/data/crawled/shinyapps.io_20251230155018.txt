Easy to Use

Deploying your Shiny applications could not be easier. You don’t need to own a server or know how to configure a firewall to deploy and manage your applications in the cloud. No hardware, installation, or annual purchase contract required.

Secure

shinyapps.io is secure-by-design. Each Shiny application runs in its own protected environment and access is always SSL encrypted. Standard and Professional plans offer user authentication, preventing anonymous visitors from being able to access your applications.

Scalable

We bring our IT team so you won’t have to bring yours. Be confident your compute resources will scale effortlessly as your Shiny applications and users increase.
