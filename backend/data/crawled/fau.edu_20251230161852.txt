STUDENT STORIES
First and Proud
Kayla Harris, like many Florida Atlantic University students, is the first in her family to attend a four-year university. Kayla credits her grandmother with giving her the support and encouragement to pursue her interest in marine biology. With the help of the Kelly/Strul Emerging Scholars program, Kayla graduated from Florida Atlantic with a B.A. in Health Science. Harris now works as an environmental monitor, focusing on sea turtles.
