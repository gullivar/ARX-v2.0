The migration process was simple and their customer support was very responsive. The server performance has been great and I haven’t had any issues. Overall, I’m very happy with Sharktech and would recommend them to anyone looking for a dedicated hosting provider. Alberto Bryant I’ve worked in IT for over 15 years and have seen several cloud hosting providers come and go. My recent transition from AWS and Azure to Sharktech’s Dedicated Cloud services stood out in my professional career. To be honest, it’s been a fantastic experience, earning it 5 stars! Let me explain why:

Sharktech’s customer service is exceptional. They don’t only answer quickly; they understand your problems and help you work through them. Sharktech really shines in an area where receiving fast and competent help can be hit or miss.

Another huge plus for me has been the price. It’s shockingly reasonable, especially given the high level of service. I’ve managed to decrease costs without sacrificing performance, which is a major deal in today’s IT industry.

However, their Dedicated Cloud service has been a game changer. It’s as if everything is tailored for you. I didn’t get the same amount of control and flexibility with AWS or Azure. I’ve observed a substantial increase in efficiency and dependability after switching.

In a nutshell, going to Sharktech was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. It’s a good, dependable service that isn’t too expensive, and the support team is excellent. If you’re thinking about switching cloud hosting providers, I highly recommend Sharktech. Jacob Kukuk Sharktech.net’s public cloud services combine top-notch security, scalability, and flexibilities. They prioritize data protection, offer adaptable solutions, and ensure low-latency connectivity across regions. With excellent customer support, it’s a reliable choice for businesses needing secure and scalable cloud solutions. Kek H. Piang I’ve been using Sharktech for several months now, colocating a server with them in the H5 data center complex in Denver, and it has been absolutely great. The value is nearly unbelievable. I’ve had zero issues whatsoever, and everything has been handled so professionally. I use my device there for lots of bandwidth-intensive stuff, such as backups, and the connectivity has been flawless. The H5 DC complex is also very impressive in terms of physical security. I once worked at a data center, and they are on another level over there from what I am used to. My data feels very secure with Sharktech. I can’t recommend them enough if you’re looking to colo a device. I hope to also try their VPS services at some point! Adrian Del Grosso I used Sharktech for dedicated server hosting, and the experience was fantastic. The servers were fast, reliable, and came with excellent DDoS protection. Their customer support was incredibly responsive, often resolving issues within minutes. Overall, the performance and competitive pricing made Sharktech a top choice for my hosting needs. Highly recommend! Asad Munir Solid VPS provider with excellent customer service. I have used their services for several years and I never had an issue. In particular, they offer good entry-level VPS services with no gimmicks and flat pricing. I’m just a hobbyist, but they also offer dedicated bare-metal servers and lots of other services.
