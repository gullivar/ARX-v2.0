Jenkins Update Sites 
Default Update Site

This is the default Jenkins update site. It is configured by default on every Jenkins instance. Its content is periodically generated by jenkins-infra/update-center2.

Configuration

To configure this default update site in Jenkins, specify https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json in Manage Jenkins » Plugins » Advanced.

This file serves JSONP despite the file name. See https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.actual.json for the JSON variant, and Site Layout for an explanation of the different files and directories available on this site.

Version-Specific Update Sites

Jenkins adds a query parameter ?version to the update site URL. This lets the update site offer plugin releases compatible with your version of Jenkins. At the moment, Jenkins weekly and LTS releases up to a year old are supported; anything older will receive update metadata for the oldest supported releases.

See Jenkins Update Center Site Architecture for more information.

Experimental Plugin Site

The experimental plugin site is located at https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/. Configure https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/update-center.json in Jenkins to receive experimental releases (those with alpha or beta in their version numbers).

See Publishing Experimental Plugin Releases for more information.

This update site always serves the latest releases, which may be incompatible with your version of Jenkins.
