I like the ease of design, but we weren't getting found online. So I learned about SEO and found RAGE. Sitemap Automator, iWeb SEO Tool, and Webcrusher have all made my sites easily accessible. Now we're on page 1 for our search terms! Thanks! " Joe Gatto Customer Review WebDesign: "As a college teacher, I have students clamoring to learn web design, but many are hardly experts. They need to see the HTML tags (the complicated stuff) but also need a simple way to just drag and drop links and images in to their pages (the simple stuff). WebDesign software lets my students do both. It gives them an immediate intro to the nitty-gritty and immediate results. It's the best software I've found yet to build a web-design course around." Dr. David Franke Customer Sitemap Automator: "As a very small business we do not have a large IT budget. Your software made much of what was necessary to achieve on our new website simple and far less time consuming than would otherwise have been the case. It was money very well spent and I would recommend it to any business in a similar position to ours where every dollar must count." Andrew Bryant Customer Review Domainer: "At CMS Web Solutions we  have been using RAGE Domainer since 2009 and it has been an effective tool in organizing and tracking over 500 domains and associated credentials that we register on behalf of our clients.  We are anxiously waiting for the next update to allow for multi-user access so that all users in our organization can easily access this information. Whenever there has been an issue,  our logged tickets have returned an efficient,  professional and timely response." Alla Ollen-Bittle Customer Review Let us help you make a successful website.
