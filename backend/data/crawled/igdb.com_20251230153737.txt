OutRun 2 (2003)
On
XBOX

This game has the wonderful original music but improved and extended with extra tracks. The graphics are on par with other original Xbox games and the new steering is great. There are also multiple fun game modes to try. It takes all the best things from the original and makes them better. This game also starts if you put it in an Xbox 360 although it's made for and works best in the original Xbox.

This is an epic classic where you drive an absolutely not Ferrari Testarossa for copyright reasons with memorable music, great looks and feel that inspired many games to come and although the steering isn't as good as one may remember the game has alot of feeling.

Perfect Dark (2010)
On
X360

The graphics have been polished and support for two joysticks added. Other than that it's very much as the original, in other words awesome and so much fun. One of the best and most impressive games from the N64. Enjoy the trip down memory lane.

Depois do FR eu pensei "pq não pegar as fitas de todas as gens com o mesmo time" eu cometi o erro de jogar dois jogos IGUAIS seguidos e enrolei 2 meses pra zerar essa bomba puta merda que ngc cansativo, porém o plot é muito bom tlk, política em pokémon 7,5/10

Eu comprei um 3ds e resolvi jogar todos os pokémon de novo, só que sem ser emulado e que experiência foda essa viu, jogar sem FF é outra coisa. Depois de 21 anos ainda é um jogo muito bom e divertido(tô completando a dex ainda)
Zero dificuldades até 8gym
No geral 8/10
