ADVANCED CREATOR TOOLS

Publish by web & email newsletter.

An editor built from the ground-up for professionals. Calm by design, with advanced workflows by default. No more suffering through clumsy toolbars or drag & oops. Immerse yourself in the story with an interface that's invisible until you need it, and powerful when you do.

Rich media & dynamic cards.

Modern publishing requires more than just words. Expand your story with image galleries, gifs, video, audio, products, info boxes, accordion toggles, downloadable files, bookmarks, and so much more.

Newsletters built-in.

Deliver posts by email newsletter to your audience, so they'll be in the loop whenever something new goes live. Segment your audience and send multiple different newsletters based on preference.

GROW YOUR AUDIENCES

Transform those clicks into contacts.

Until now, building an indie publication with memberships and subscriptions has been difficult and complicated.

Ghost makes it easy, with native signup forms that turn anonymous views into logged-in members.

Allow people to sign up for free, or purchase a paid subscription to support your work across monthly and yearly premium tiers.

Hello, new friends.

RUN YOUR BUSINESS

Manage your memberships.

See who's signing up, who's paying, and what they're reading, so you can get a better understanding of your core audience.

Native analytics.

Understand what's working. Detailed engagement analytics for your audience so you can understand what content is getting the most attention, and who your biggest fans are.

Offers & promotions.

Entice new subscribers with offers and promotions to grow your business. Run a 30% discount for your first 100 subscribers, an 80%-off Black Friday sale, or a special promotion for a live event.
