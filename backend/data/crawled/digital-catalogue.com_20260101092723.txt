With this new tool, Customers are able to send us their orders in an easy way for example via Messenger or WhatsApp and the digital experience we offer them meanwhile is seamless and it fits the expectations of modern digital era. Interactively Digital Solutions proved to be an excellent partner that we can always count on. We had no more than 3 weeks for the introduction and despite the enormous time pressure, the company provided us extraordinary and accurate help, always trying to provide the best-in-class solution for our market. The company had many own ideas and initiatives proactively and they did not stop at the introduction of the tool, they still provide us high quality customer care. Professional background is one thing, but I also have to highlight how cooperative and helpful colleagues the company has, it is a wonderful feeling to have contact persons that we can trust and who are eager to help us anytime. We really appreciate the cooperation we have together.
