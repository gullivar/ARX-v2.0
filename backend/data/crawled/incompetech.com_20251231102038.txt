Fringe Theater Festival Fundraiser December 6, 2025 This year, incompetech helped out the Green Bay Fringe Theater Festival by donating matching funds to their fundraising efforts. GB Fringe met their annual fundraising goals! 
Looking forward to another year of awesome, crazy, strange, solid, emotional, and wild live events!  (Not all in the same show) The official fundraising event is over, but I’m pretty sure they will still accept donations. News Archive © 1997–2025 Incompetech Inc.
