Keras: Deep Learning for humans About Keras Getting started Developer guides Code examples Keras 3 API documentation Keras 2 API documentation KerasTuner: Hyperparam Tuning KerasHub: Pretrained Models GET STARTED GUIDES API EXAMPLES KERAS TUNER KERAS RS KERAS HUB KERAS 3.0 RELEASED A superpower for ML developers Keras is a deep learning API designed for human beings, not
              machines. Keras focuses on debugging speed, code elegance &
              conciseness, maintainability, and deployability. When you choose
              Keras, your codebase is smaller, more readable, easier to iterate
              on. API DOCS GUIDES EXAMPLES Copied inputs = keras.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3))

                work with JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Build models that can move
                seamlessly across these frameworks and leverage the strengths of
                each ecosystem. GET STARTED Developer Guides VIEW ALL Copied inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
