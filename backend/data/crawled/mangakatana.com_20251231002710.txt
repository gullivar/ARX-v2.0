I came here with only the goal of revenge.

I overthrew the Tulkan Empire, a single nation that dominated the continent.

I had always succeeded in gaining victory. I had accomplished all I needed to and was satisfied.

That’s why I accepted my approaching death. I no longer had a reason to live.

And so my heart stopped beating.

I definitely felt it stop.

However, what in the world happened?

“It’s not black magic and it doesn’t seem like an illusion either.”

A boy with short, black hair was reflected in the mirror.

I looked exactly like when I was 14, which was 20 years ago. A young boy, who hasn’t lost his baby fat yet, patted his cheeks and murmured, “How is this possible?”.

I had returned.

This baby isn’t yours.” Simon’s eyes glistened coldly at my words. Apparently he’s smiling, but in a strange and spine-chilling tone, Simon asked me. “…Oh, really?” That low, shady voice, pretending to be gentle. The anger in his voice was cold and cruel enough to freeze his surroundings. “Then, which bastard does that child belongs to?” He’s angry. I’ve known him for a long time that’s why I could tell. That’s the voice that comes out when he can no longer hold back his anger. But then… why the hell is he so upset? “If you’ll know, what are you going to do?” “That jerk can’t even be a good father so…” “…… so what?” “I can’t let him live.” Oh no. I’m in trouble. After seeing his blue eyes lit with fire, there’s no way I could tell him now that it’s his child.

AdventureComedyDramaMysteryRomanceSchool LifeShounenAward winning
Shinichi Kudo is a high-school student who, by using observation and deduction, is good at solving mysteries. While investigating one, he is caught by the criminals that he was watching and forced to take an experimental drug. Leaving him for dead, the criminals disappear. Instead of killing him, however, the drug turns Shinichi into a little kid.
To preserve the illusion of his 'disappearance,' Shinichi adopts a new name based on his favorite author (Arthur Conan Doyle) and becomes Conan Edogawa. Ran, his (actually Shinichi's) childhood friend takes this little boy under her wing and brings him to her home.
Conan now lives at a detective agency run by Ran's father, but his mind is as keen as ever and he continues to solve mysteries... always allowing Ran's father to take all the credit.
As far as everyone's concerned, Conan is just a little kid anyway... even to Ran. This is *extremely* frustrating to Conan since nobody will listen to a 'little boy.' Despite this, Conan has a mission... to find the criminals who did this to him and get the antidote to that drug.

Note: Won the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the shōnen category in 2001.
