Over the past 12 months, you’ve probably signed up for new apps, tried out services, and maybe even forgotten a few accounts along the way. Those unused logins? They’re a hacker’s dream. A year-end audit can help you lock down your security and start the new year with peace of mind. Why Forgotten Accounts Are Dangerous Every account you create stores personal data—email addresses, passwords, and sometimes payment details. When you stop using an account, you often forget about it, but hackers don’t. Old accounts are rarely monitored, making them easy targets. If one of those accounts gets breached, attackers can use the information to access your other accounts through credential stuffing or phishing . The Year-End Domino Effect Imagine this: You signed up for a streaming service last January and never logged in again. That service suffers a data breach, exposing your email and password. If you reused that password elsewhere, hackers now have a key to your other accounts. One forgotten login can lead to a chain reaction of compromised accounts. How to Perform a Year-End Audit Here’s a simple checklist to get started: List All Your Accounts Think about social media, shopping sites, streaming services, and old apps. If you can’t remember them all, check your email for sign-up confirmations. Check for Data Breaches Use tools like “ Have I Been Pwned ” to see if your email has been involved in any data leaks this year. Delete What You Don’t Use If you haven’t logged in for months and don’t plan to, delete the account. Fewer accounts mean fewer risks. Update Passwords For accounts you keep, make sure passwords are strong and unique. A password manager can help. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for hackers to break in. Start the New Year Secure Auditing your accounts isn’t just a good idea—it’s a smart habit. Make it part of your year-end routine, just like cleaning out your closet or reviewing your finances. A few minutes now can save you from a major headache later. Every unused account is a potential vulnerability. Clean up your digital footprint and start the new year with confidence.
