Collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of G. William Miller. HALIFAX .- This is the first exhibition of Edward Mitchell Bannister’s work presented in Canada—124 years after the artist’s death. Born in Saint Andrews, New Brunswick, Bannister was an accomplished, nineteenth-century African American painter known for pastoral landscapes. In addition to being a respected painter and abolitionist (with his wife Christiana Carteaux Bannister), he won first prize at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia for his painting Under the Oaks (now lost), making him the first African American/Canadian to win a major American art prize. While Bannister is increasingly revered in the United States, he remains largely unknown in Canada. Edward Mitchell Bannister (1828-1901) was born in Saint Andrews, New Brunswick. His family lived in a segregated Black village at the eastern end of Saint Andrews colloquially referred to as Slabtown. Bannister was orphaned at age sixteen and left in the care of Harris Hatch, a wealthy lawyer, merchant, and Registrar o ...

Stern Architects). Credit: RAMSA / Alden Studios. NEW YORK, NY .- Dr. Louise Mirrer, president and CEO of The New York Historical, announced that the institution will open its new Tang Wing for American Democracy on June 18, 2026, greatly expanding both the landmark building and The Historical’s wide-ranging schedule of exhibitions, educational initiatives, and public programs. Dedicated to the history and future of the nation’s founding principles, the 71,000-square-foot Tang Wing will open as the United States launches the celebration of its 250th anniversary. The Tang Wing will enable a tenfold increase in participation in The Historical’s award-winning Academy for American Democracy. Developed to address critical gaps in the teaching of American history and civics, the Academy’s four-day intensive program will now serve 30,000 sixth-grade students each year in new classrooms in the wing. Other facilities housed ... More Christian Marclay, Sleeves and Covers (Sixteen 7”/No 21), 2025. Unique monoprint on Somerset paper, 35-1/4 x 35-1/4 inches (approx. framed) [89.5 x 89.5 cm]. SAN FRANCISCO, CA .- Fraenkel Gallery will present an exhibition of new work by Christian Marclay featuring prints, collages, and a video. Fascination with vinyl records has long informed Marclay’s artistic practice. In this exhibition, the artist focuses on the recurring motifs found within the familiar square format of LP covers, exploring how music is packaged, distributed, and consumed. Following his inclusion in the 1998 Fraenkel Gallery exhibition Dust Breeding organized by artist and curator Steve Wolfe, the exhibition will be Marclay’s sixth solo show with the gallery since 2008. A reception with the artist will take place at the gallery on Saturday, January 17, from 11am to 1pm. In eleven new works on paper, Marclay inks the sleeves and covers from 7”, 10”, and 12” vinyl records, printing them as monotypes. Unlike etchings or lithographs, the monotype process creates a single unique impression, capturing the folds, creases, and surface wear of these  ... More Lucian Freud, Boy Smoking, 1950-51.

THE HAGUE .- From 14 February 14, the Kunstmuseum Den Haag presents the major group exhibition London Calling in partnership with Tate. It brings together highlights of postwar figurative painting from Britain for the first time in the Netherlands, featuring works by, among others, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, David Hockney and Paula Rego. London is what unites them: as a crossroads of ideas and a snapshot of the times. For this survey of the so-called ‘School of London’, Tate is lending around forty-five exceptional works by these artists and painters who are less well-known outside Britain such as Michael Andrews, Frank Auerbach, R.B. Kitaj and Leon Kossoff. Featuring almost seventy works, the exhibition demonstrates how key figures in postwar British painting remained devoted to depicting the human figure, and thus the human condition. But it also questions the canon  ... More Guggenheim Jeune and the Fucina degli Angeli: Two major exhibitions at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 2026 "Tales of Paranoia": R. Crumb returns to Los Angeles with first major comic work in decades Michella Bredahl brings vibrant color and fluid femininity to Huis Marseille Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Equilibrium (Equilibre), 1932. Oil on canvas, 41.7 x 33.5 cm. Stiftung Arp e. V., Berlin/Rolandswerth. VENICE .- The London gallery Guggenheim Jeune and the Fucina degli Angeli take center stage in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection’s exhibition program in 2026, which highlights two historical moments in the collecting activity of the American patron, set in dialogue with the permanent collection. On April 25, 2026, the museum will present the first major museum exhibition celebrating Peggy Guggenheim’s extraordinary years in London and her first gallery, Guggenheim Jeune. In the fall, a stunning show will explore the Fucina degli Angeli, a fascinating chapter in the history of artistic glassmaking which involved some of the leading figures of twentieth-century art, including Peggy Guggenheim, who was in many ways its “godmother.” Following the closing of the tribute to Lucio Fontana’s ceramics on March 2, 2026, the new exhibition season opens with Peggy Guggenheim in London: The Making of a Collector (April 25–October 19, 2026), organized by Gražina Subelytė, ... More Panel from R. Crumb, I'm Afraid, 2025 � Robert Crumb, 2025. Courtesy the artist, Paul Morris, and David Zwirner. LOS ANGELES, CA .- David Zwirner is presenting an exhibition of new drawings and prints by iconic illustrator and cartoonist R. Crumb (b. 1943), on view at the gallery’s 616 N Western Avenue location in Los Angeles. In his works of the last several years Crumb reflects on life in his eighties and his sixty-year career as well as themes of personal and mass paranoia during these times of social and political unrest. Crumb’s most mordant attacks are, as always, reserved for himself and show him contending with his own manic anxieties in a humorous and insightful manner. The new works in this exhibition represent Crumb’s first extensive solo comic work in over two decades, marking an impressive late-career resurgence. Many of these incisive, introspective, and formally adventurous illustrations were made for the artist’s forthcoming publication, Tales of Paranoia. This new comic book—Crumb’s first in twenty-three years—will be published in November of 2025 by Fantagraphics ... More Michella Bredahl, Gwendolyne Dumoulin (Crocolyne) in Her Room, in Paris, 2024 in collaboration with Lotta Volkova. � Michella Bredahl. AMSTERDAM .- Huis Marseille, Museum for Photography is presenting Rooms We Made Safe, the first museum exhibition by the rising artist Michella Bredahl (1988, Greve, Denmark). Bredahl is known for her distinctively intimate portraits of friends and acquaintances, capturing them in unguarded moments at home. Yet a home does not necessarily mean safety. Tracing a deeply personal lineage, the show reaches back to photographs taken by Bredahl’s mother before her birth, and those they created together during her childhood. Bredahl grew up in a social housing district on the outskirts of Copenhagen with her single mother and her younger sister. The apartment was filled with a vibrant colour palette that defied the prevailing minimalist Scandinavian aesthetic. Each room had its own distinct hue: deep blue, bright red, and floral patterns blooming across the surfaces. When Bredahl was seven, her mother handed her camera to her. Together they would document their shared intimate ... More Kunstmuseum Brandts unveils Ovartaci paintings sent to Jean Dubuffet Icelandic Art Center announces new Director Shelburne Museum announces 2026 exhibition schedule Kunstmuseum Brandts tells the poignant story of Ovartaci and her connection to the Cobra movement. ODENSE .- Overlooked and acclaimed, outsider and insider, man and woman, on the periphery and at the centre of art history. The artist Ovartaci occupies a space where conflicting aspects intersect, fuelling an enduring fascination with her fate and art alike. In art, Ovartaci the artist and Ovartaci the human being was able to find a safe space amidst an unusually harsh fate. All her life, she fought for understanding, respect and change. Even in Ovartaci’s own day, internationally acclaimed artists such as Asger Jorn and Jean Dubuffet, both of whom are featured in the exhibition, were fascinated by her artistic abilities and effortless access to the wellspring of creativity. Even so, true appreciation of the sheer quality of her works and their significant place in art history has come only recently, within the past few years. Now, Kunstmuseum Brandts tells the poignant story of Ovartaci and her connection to the Cobra movement. The exhibition presents the artist’s ... More Cecilie C. Ragnhei�ard�ttir Gaihede.

Cecilie has worked as Project Manager for Collections and Research at the Ger�arsafn Art Museum since 2020 and at the Natural History Museum of K�pavogur since 2023. She previously served as a professional and project manager at the Sarpur Management Company (Rekstrarf�lag Sarps). Two of her research, publication, and exhibition projects at Ger�arsafn are now in their final stages and will conclude with exhibitions opening next year. She led the comprehensive reorganization of Ger�arsafn’s data archive as a consultant between 2020 and 2022 and has managed a variety of projects in the museum and art sectors in recent years. Cecilie holds a degree in Art History from the University of Iceland, as well as two master’s degrees in  ... More Norman Rockwell, The Craftsman, 1963. Oil on canvas, 47 1/4 x 38 1/4 in. Collection of Shelburne Museum, gift of Polycor and Rock of Ages Corporation. 2024-12.1. Photography by Andy Duback. SHELBURNE, VT .- Shelburne Museum announced its 2026 exhibitions, featuring major presentations that will explore American art, regional identity, material culture, and contemporary creativity. The museum will present five exhibitions that highlight both the breadth of the museum’s permanent collection and the vitality of new contemporary work. The museum will be open May 9 through October 25, 2026. “As we look toward 2026, our exhibitions reflect the museum’s commitment to presenting art and material culture that illuminates the many ways Americans have represented themselves, their histories, and the landscapes they call home,” said Kory Rogers, Francie and John Downing Senior Curator of American Art at Shelburne Museum. “From Norman Rockwell’s vision of Vermont to the exuberance of Carl D’Alvia’s monumental sculptures to the extraordinary  ... More The exhibition "We've been at the Tapestry Studio since the 90s' is now on view at Salt Picasso Museum M�laga closes 2025 by reaffirming its cultural leadership The Cyclops: A playful exhibition that gets visitors moving at Museum Cobra Installation view from the exhibition We've Been at the Tapestry Studio Since the 90s, Salt Beyoğlu. Photo: Metean Bars (Salt). ISTANBUL .- Salt’s exhibition, We’ve Been at the Tapestry Studio Since the 90s, focuses on the Tapestry Studio within Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University’s Department of Painting and its approach to art education. While exploring its relationship with everyday life, the exhibition also highlights the potential of creative dissent and collective production. Tracing the physical and conceptual connections meticulously built since the founding of the studio, it presents a collage of collaborative and individual works, archival materials, and testimonies of artists who have passed through this space. The production of contemporary art and the discussions it sparked gained momentum in Turkey during the 1990s, establishing links with social and political movements. Their place within the academic curricula, however, remained limited. Upholding its long-standing traditions, MSGS� remained distant from the diverse practices flourishing  ... More Visitors observe Pablo Picasso’s timeline at the Museo Picasso M�laga � Museo Picasso M�laga. MALAGA .- The Picasso Museum M�laga is ending 2025 on solid ground. With 792,366 visitors over the year, the museum has confirmed what has become increasingly clear: its audience is stable, loyal, and deeply engaged. The figure, nearly identical to last year’s total, reflects not only sustained interest in Pablo Picasso’s work, but also confidence in the museum’s broader cultural vision. Rather than chasing growth at all costs, the museum appears to have reached a moment of maturity—one defined by consistency, quality, and relevance in a highly competitive cultural and tourism landscape. The year unfolded between two major Picasso-focused exhibitions with distinct perspectives. Picasso: The Royan Notebooks opened the calendar by bringing together, for the first time, the eight sketchbooks the artist produced during his stay in Royan after the outbreak of the Second World War. Drawings, gouaches, poems, and works by Dora Maar revealed a period  ... More De Cycloop, installation view Museum Cobra, 2025. Photo: LNDWstudio. AMSTELVEEN .- Museum Cobra presents The Cyclops – a playful, energetic exhibition that focuses on movement, collaboration and sensory experience. Seven artists transform the museum's Water Hall into a living system of marbles, installations, and chain reactions. The exhibition is rooted in the spirit of the Cobra movement. Artists such as Karel Appel, Constant, and Lotti van der Gaag used intuition and physicality as a counterweight to rationality and control. For them, playfulness was no mere ornament, but a necessity. The Cyclops shows how that energy still lives on today. The starting point for The Cyclops is a recognisable object: the marble. Each artist develops their own installation in which movement, mechanics, or chain reactions play a central role. Together, the works form a dynamic whole in which the marble functions as a mindful eye – a moving faculty that establishes connections between the various parts. The title refers to the mythical cyclops: a one-eyed giant who, in this  ... More Quote Jackson Pollock is someone who knocked you flat with his arbitrariness. Clement Greenberg More News Exhibition at the Norton Simon Museum will explore the intimate world of Galka Scheyer PASADENA, CA .- Opening at the Norton Simon Museum on February 20, 2026, Dear Little Friend: Impressions of Galka Scheyer offers an intimate view of the German-born art dealer and collector Galka Scheyer (1889–1945), known for her pivotal role in bringing European modernism to the United States and promoting the so-called Blue Four—Lyonel Feininger, Alexei Jawlensky, Paul Klee and Vassily Kandinsky. This focus exhibition looks at her legacy through a lesser-known aspect of her life—the friendships she forged with both artists and supporters. Drawn from Scheyer’s archive and collection, which was transferred to the Pasadena Art Institute (now the Norton Simon Museum) in 1953, the exhibition features portraits of Scheyer given to her by artists Alexei Jawlensky, Maynard Dixon, Peter Krasnow and Beatrice Wood, among others. Alongside these are  ... More Exhibition at The New York Historical presents selections from the David M. Rubenstein Americana Collection NEW YORK, NY .- The New York Historical presents Declaring the Revolution: America’s Printed Path to Independence; Historical Works from the David M. Rubenstein Americana Collection to celebrate next year’s 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Tracing the development of the ideas and beliefs of the American Revolution through original, historical printings, the exhibition explores how their dissemination in the most turbulent days of the war both strengthened the political cause for American independence and assisted the military victories of the Continental Army and Navy. Declaring the Revolution portrays the arc of the struggle through 18th-century pamphlets, broadsides, engravings, proclamations, and books, each declaring  ... More Cornering the museum: Nedko Solakov brings "The Miner's Dream" to Grand-Hornu HORNU .- Bulgarian artist Nedko Solakov began his career in the 1980s, after studying mural painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sofia, and then training at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (HISK) in 1986. He emerged onto the art scene in a tense socio-political context, Bulgaria being at the time under the influence of the Soviet regime. Very early on, he adopted a critical stance towards this regime, an attitude which he has maintained throughout his career by regularly addressing contemporary political and social issues. Writing and storytelling occupy a central place in his work. Through text, Solakov infuses his works and installations with irony and humour imbued with gentle sarcasm and self-mockery. A multidisciplinary visual artist, he explores the polysemy of language and ideas, playing with a multiplicity of supports and materials. His visual language, at first  ... More Parisa Karimi explores landscapes of healing at Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts KAOHSIUNG CITY .- How to Connect With Landscape is the title of both the solo exhibition and the expansive three-channel video installation of Parisa Karimi in KFMA. The exhibition brings together recent works that explore regeneration and healing as acts of resistance across postindustrial and postcolonial terrains—both internal and external. Through multi-sensory and poetic approaches, Karimi creates embodied encounters between landscape and the body, tracing interconnections across ecological, emotional, and political dimensions. The video installation How to Connect With Landscape, realized in the S�pmi region of Sweden, investigates one of the world’s largest forest ecosystems—an essential global carbon sink. Under the pressures of industrial development and the climate crisis, Karimi follows the deep entanglements between humans and landscape  ... More New group show at Klaus von Nichtssagend Gallery explores the power of the point NEW YORK, NY .- The group show Dot takes as its starting point the point itself. The dot is a form that recurs in myriad ways in contemporary art, from mark-making technique to image and motif. This show is a small slice of these iterations. As Jennifer Bartlett famously stated “When in doubt, dot.” and it seems she was not alone. The recurring use of dots as a picture-making strategy has found its way into the practice of artists from fresh approaches to Pointillism in the work of Yoko Ono, Glenn Goldberg and Graham Anderson, to explorations of dot-matrix reproduction and printing mechanisms in works by Liz Deschenes, Yuki Higashino and Marsha Cottrell. Nancy Brooks Brody and Tony Feher both worked in Bartlett’s studio during their lifetimes and dots found their way into their own Minimalist approach to sculpture. A playful twist of gathering and stacking found circular  ... More Hilda Palafox explores ecofeminism and folklore at Sean Kelly NEW YORK, NY .- Sean Kelly announced De Tierra y Susurros, an exhibition of new paintings and sculptural reliefs by Hilda Palafox. In this powerful body of work, Palafox explores a metaphoric and visual language rooted in Latin American folklore and ecofeminist thought. With this series she reflects on humanity’s interdependence with the natural world. There will be an opening reception on Thursday, January 8 from 6-8pm. The artist will be present. Rooted in the human condition, Palafox’s practice addresses themes of identity and resilience through a distinctly feminine lens. Her work unfolds as an inquiry into subjectivity and the body, balancing intimacy with monumentality. Exploring the tension between public grandeur and inner sensitivity, Palafox’s imagery resides between the invisible emotional landscape and its external, formal expression. ... More Master of Senegalese modernism returns to Selebe Yoon Dakar DAKAR .- Entitled ‘El Hadji Sy: New Paintings’, the exhibition brings together a range of large-scale works made over the last fifteen years of senegalese artist El Hadji Sy. Whether viewed from the front or in profile, the characters painted by El Hadji Sy impose themselves on visitors with the power of their gaze and their contours. The visages encountered day after day intertwine with those of legendary or historical figures, making each painted character the heir to a history that is both collective and singular. His use of colour becomes a time machine, ultimately erasing spatial and temporal references to emphasise solely the figures that emerge from the frames as if they were windows, staring at us in the 21st century. At the entrance to the gallery, the work entitled ‘Feu rouge (Red Light)” (2022) refers to the film-maker and artist Bouna Medoune Seye. Seen in profile, facing  ... More Four new must-see art exhibitions from the Kent State University School of Art Collection and Galleries KENT, OH .- This winter, the Kent State University School of Art Collection and Galleries invites the public to experience three compelling exhibitions that span bold contemporary voices, historic printmaking traditions and landmark German Expressionist works.

More MCNY explores Robert Rauschenberg's "Real World" New York NEW YORK, NY .- In celebration of the centennial of Robert Rauschenberg (1925–2008), and in partnership with the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY) presents Robert Rauschenberg’s New York: Pictures from the Real World. This dynamic show explores Rauschenberg’s innovative integration of photography and found objects into his art, reflecting his deep engagement with “the real world” and his complex relationship with New York City. Widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of postwar New York, Rauschenberg’s irreverent approach to art-making pushed the envelope for an entire generation, reshaping the art world in New York and around the world. At the heart of his practice was a desire to incorporate the tangible world around him into his art. Gathering materials and inspiration from his surroundings, ...
