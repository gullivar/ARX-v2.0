Like with all innovations, Bitcoin went through a period where it struggled to captivate people’s attention. It was a momentous occasion when it finally reached the $1 valuation mark. However, slowly but surely, it has become to be accepted as a legitimate currency and something of value. As BTC’s use increases around the world, companies have begun accepting payments in this currency. Online casinos were early adopters of BTC and some of the first major companies to accept cryptocurrencies. Online gambling sites realized that they were potentially alienating a large player base by forcing them to deposit with credit or debits and e-wallets to play. Many gamblers do not have access to these cards or can’t risk gambling transactions showing up on their statements, and many e-wallets force users to have a card attached to their account for the process of verification. Bitcoin quickly and easily solves this problem. Anyone can purchase BTC through various methods and then instantly send it to an online site to gamble while keeping their payment details safe and their identities hidden. The use of BTC transformed the market, allowing millions of extra gamblers to enjoy BTC gambling sites now. BTC is a highly secure payment method that protects both the customer and the sites, allowing customers to wager safely and securely. As more online gamblers use BTC, Bitcoin casinos continue to grow and develop. Comparing BTC casinos to standard ones is never simple as each has its unique advantages and disadvantages, which cancel each other out. You will read Bitcoin casino review sites and look at the best Bitcoin gambling sites. In the end, the services on offer are almost identical, with both providing a wide range of games and fun promotions. The advantages of using a Bitcoin casino include: No fees - Players do not have to worry about paying anything when transferring or withdrawing funds using BTC. Other online providers will often charge fees when using credit cards. These fees can quickly add up, costing you thousands if you are a frequent gambler. Highly secure - BTC transactions are famous for being incredibly secure and safe. You never have to worry about your payment details getting into the hands of criminals. It simply isn't possible with crypto. Play with a deflationary currency - Unlike fiat currencies, BTC is designed to rise over time. By gambling with Bitcoin, you are actually winning more than it seems, as it will have a higher valuation in the future. Bypass 3rd parties - When you use BTC, there is no 3rd party involved. You are dealing directly with the online gambling site. It speeds up payments, and gamblers don’t have to worry about paying commissions. No bankers are sticking their hands out for a slice. Anonymity - Bitcoin casinos do not require to Know Your Customer (KYC). You do not have to provide your name, date of birth, or proof of address. Other online sites require all of these details and often take a long time to verify your identity. At a BTC casino, you can keep your details private and start gambling immediately. BITCOIN GAMBLING: HOW TO GET STARTED After checking out a few Bitcoin casino reviews, getting started is super easy. Firstly, you need to set up a BTC wallet and then acquire some Bitcoins. Then you simply sign up at a casino with BTC, deposit your crypto, and start gambling. Keep an eye out for different promotions. You can often get a deposit match bonus and free spins. These promotions can give you a higher chance of winning. It is critical that you select a safe and secure BTC wallet. Your wallet is essentially your bank. If it is insecure or fraudulent, you could lose your crypto. Bitcoin wallets work similarly to e-wallets, but they only hold cryptocurrencies. There are three types of wallets, online, offline wallet, and finally, a hardware wallet. Online wallets are the easiest to use, and we recommend beginners start with them. Hardware wallets are the most secure, but they are a little more difficult to use. You should acquire a hardware wallet when you have large amounts of BTC. Before selecting a wallet, read some reviews, explore the layout and check out the instructions. Before long, you will be a BTC wallet expert. Acquiring Bitcoins is also pretty simple. Most people choose to purchase them on exchanges that function just like a foreign currency exchange. Be sure to read some reviews before you choose an exchange. Alternatively, if you know friends who are gambling with crypto, they may be able to help you out and even boost your initial bankroll. Some gambling sites allow you to exchange fiat currency for BTC within their site, so you don’t have to worry about sourcing them yourself but be careful with fees or poor exchange rates. When gambling at a Bitcoin casino, all transactions are done with Bitcoin. You deposit, bet and withdraw in this currency. To deposit or withdraw, you simply head to the cashier page and follow the instructions. This page is similar to all online gambling spots. BTC casinos make it very easy to deposit and withdraw, so new players can quickly familiarize themselves with the process. Before you deposit and start playing, please carefully read the site’s terms and conditions. All sites have different rules. It is extremely important you understand them before playing. Otherwise, your overall gambling experience may be impacted. We don’t want you to be unable to access your funds or have to wait weeks for a withdrawal to be processed. THE MOST POPULAR BITCOIN CASINO GAMES Gamblers are spoilt for choice when playing at a BTC casino. Players receive all the benefits of a traditional online casino plus some extra crypto-only advantages. There are often thousands of games to choose from, just like in real life. If you have played in offline or online casinos, you will instantly recognize all of the games when you step into a Bitcoin one. Some of the popular BTC casino games include Bitcoin roulette, baccarat, and blackjack. Thousands and thousands of players are wagering on these games every day. These games function just like their original versions, so if you already know the rules, you are ready to jump in and bet. BTC video slots are also a massive hit with gamblers across the world. There are so many different themes and developers that players can always find their lucky game. Some places offer 1000 + slot games alone. You can also find progressive jackpot slot machines, which give players the chance to win mouthwatering jackpots, which can be in the millions. A cool feature of many BTC sites is live dealer games. This is where players connect to a real casino via streaming services and get to play with a real dealer and cards. It allows players to transport an offline gambling house to their living rooms. This is so much fun as you get to chat with dealers, and it provides a unique experience where online and offline gambling are blended together. Many casinos host live games from world-class operators such as Evolution Gaming. For the first time, Bitcoin video casino players just remember that the games on offer are identical to those you would find in an offline or non-Bitcoin online site. If you understand slot machines, video poker, and the classic table games, you will have no problem adapting to a BTC site. If you can't find the particular game you want, just keep searching. You will eventually find a BTC site with the exact one you want. HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST BITCOIN CASINO TO PLAY IN? Selecting the best Bitcoin casino is not a decision you should make lightly. The difference between top Bitcoin casino sites and poor sites can be massive and seriously hurt your betting experience. Before you choose your site, you need to decide what features you value and then research different options until you find a site that meets all of your requirements. It is best to research the following factors before making your choice: Good reputation - Before selecting a Bitcoin casino, search review sites and forums. You want to hear experiences from gamblers who have actually used the site. If the experiences are overwhelmingly good, this is a strong sign you have found a real Bitcoin casino. Wide range of Bitcoin casino games - The more games a site offers, the more fun it is to play. If a Bitcoin casino only offers a few games, it is easy to become bored, but if a site has 1000 + games, you will be kept entertained for years. You also need to check whether the site has the specific games you value. If you love live baccarat, but the site doesn't offer it, then there is no point in signing up. We recommend finding a Bitcoin casino with everything from slots, live dealer games, video poker, and more. Generous bonuses and VIP programs - Some providers offer great value bonuses and VIP programs. They will typically provide deposit and reload bonuses as well as free spins, cashback, and points. These can be worth tens of thousands of dollars if you are a regular player. Nice site layout - Take a deep dive into the site before joining. Head to the homepage and start exploring. Check out the different sections from games, promotions, VIP, and customer support. The best Bitcoin casinos have nicely designed websites that are highly responsive and easy to navigate. If you do not like the design and find it hard to locate different games, then the site isn’t for you. You want to find a site that is a joy to interact with.

BTC casino gaming should be an amazing hobby, and we want to do everything we can to ensure you enjoy your BTC betting experience. OUR STEP-BY-STEP BITCOIN CASINO REVIEW METHODOLOGY Signing Up We do not create accounts and reviews at the behest of providers. All of our reviews are conducted independently, with the user's best interest at heart. When signing up, we create an account anonymously, exactly like all other gamblers. This prevents conflict of interest and helps us get a true feel for a site. Our information is always reliable because we are experiencing the same conditions as other players. It also helps us detail the registration process and let our readers know the exact steps involved, including what information they require. Checking the Bonus Offers We know online gamblers love no deposit welcome bonuses with free spins, and so do we. The bonus can really sway a player’s decision on what gambling site to choose. I mean, who doesn’t like the chance to win some free money? For this reason, when creating a review, we always use this bonus. Sometimes these promotions and special deals are a little too good to be true. They are often unavailable or come with strict terms and conditions. To avoid our readers getting burned, we always do a thorough deep dive into promotions and bonuses. Evaluating the Casino Interface Just because gamblers are playing online does not mean they don't deserve to play in a nicely designed virtual casino. We believe online players deserve the same treatment as offline casino gamblers. Unfortunately, we can't find sites that will provide free hotel rooms and comp your dinner, but you never know, maybe in the future, we will. We always closely monitor and evaluate the design, layout, and responsiveness of an online site. If a site is slow, looks old-fashioned, or has poorly constructed menus, then don't worry. We are not shy about criticizing the shortcomings of certain sites. Evaluating Gaming Experience When looking at the overall gaming experience, we break down the site step by step. We start with the registration process from the beginning, explore all the different parts of the site, and talk to customer support. We are looking for areas in which the site excels and places where it needs to improve. Our method gives us the ability to provide reviews based on the first-hand experience as we have actually personally tested the different features. Analyzing Game Selection & Software Top-tier online gambling sites typically offer players a wide selection of games from world-class software developers. Our reviews always include the number and types of games available. We also review the developers of the games and inspect the sites for a certified number generator. We expect the software to be highly responsive and stable. With so much competition amongst BTC casinos, if they want to score highly, they better have a huge selection of games from the very best software developers. Only having a small choice of games from no-name providers is no longer good enough. Checking the Withdrawal Process In our reviews, we always break down the entire withdrawal process. We look specifically at things such as speed and reliability. Nobody wants to be left waiting for weeks to receive their hard-earned winnings. It is important that sites support your specific withdrawal option. For example, if you want to withdraw in BTC, but the site is only a Bitcoin cash casino, it isn’t a suitable option. Sites that offer multiple options and process withdrawals instantly score very highly. Our reviews also explore how and when bonuses are paid out and deposit methods and speed. Customer Support Customer service is the backbone of any business and is incredibly important at online gambling sites where sometimes huge amounts of money are at stake. The best Bitcoin casinos offer exceptional customer service. We always contact customer support on different days and times, via multiple methods and with different requests. We evaluate how quickly they respond, the ease of contacting them, how professional they are, and their problem-solving skills. Online sites with customer support that can be instantly contacted through a 24/7 chat and always go the extra mile for their customers score highly. Transactions & Payment Policies The best Bitcoin casinos offer a range of payment methods that can be used easily and quickly. We always check how long it takes to process both deposits and withdrawals and check the terms behind chasing out bonuses. We also explore different limitations such as commissions and minimum/maximum withdrawals and deposits. Some sites will have low withdrawal limits in an effort to get winners to keep playing even when they want to cash out their bankroll. We don’t want our readers getting money stuck on any site or having to pay big fees. HOW TO DEPOSIT BITCOIN TO FUND YOUR ACCOUNT? Depositing Bitcoin at an online provider is simple. Just follow these steps: Set up a Bitcoin Wallet - Bitcoin users have lots of choices. If you are looking for a fast and simple option, online checkout wallets. Sign up to an online provider - Create an account and head to the cashier page. Click the deposit icon and copy the displayed Bitcoin address. Deposit your Bitcoin - Head to the send or withdraw section of your wallet, paste the Bitcoin address you copied, and type the amount you want to deposit. Make sure you triple check the address is correct. If you want an instant deposit, consider increasing the confirmation fee. Wait for the confirmation - Some online sites make you wait until your transaction is confirmed, while others let you play right away. Once the transaction has been confirmed, you are good to go and can start playing. Terms in using bitcoin in online casino Each day the number of online gambling sites allowing Bitcoin transactions is rising. However, many providers still do not support Bitcoin payments. Before you find a provider, make sure they accept Bitcoin. You can find a site’s accepted payment methods on their homepage, in the FAQ section or under terms and conditions. In these sections, providers will also let you know their deposit methods and limits. Funding and cashing out in a bitcoin casino As highlighted above, the first step in funding your gambling account is to sign up for a Bitcoin wallet. Then simply deposit by pasting the site's deposit address into the withdrawal section of your wallet. If you do not have BTCs, you need to exchange and purchase them like you would purchase foreign currency. There are many to choose from. Look for ones with low fees, high trading volume, and that are licensed. Also, make sure they accept your desired payment method. Most accept Mastercard, Visa, e-wallets, and bank transfers. Cashing out from a Bitcoin casino is very easy. You just head to the cashier page within the site and click the withdraw button. Then you just paste your wallet address into the form and type how much you want to withdraw. Your Bitcoin should be sent to your wallet nearly instantly. FAQ How does provably fair work? Provably Fair works based on encryption using the hash methodology. An encrypted hash value is generated between the clients and server seeds. These are the steps involved: An anonymous seed is produced and then placed into a hash code via the server. The hash code is sent to the player. The gamer enters a random client seed. The seeds are encrypted and placed together. The server seed is displayed to the gamer for verification. Ways in determining if a bitcoin casino is provably fair You need to keep an eye out for two things when evaluating the fairness of a provider. You should always check reviews and customer feedback. If a provider has lots of positive feedback from verified players, this is a good sign. Forums are a good place to get the opinion of actual players. You also want to ensure the results generated by the provider occur locally. How secure bitcoin casinos are? The best way to determine if a Bitcoin casino is secure is to see if the site is licensed and evaluate its reputation. It is best to check review sites and read forums to see players' experiences on the site. There is an element of risk when choosing a site. However, if you only play at sites that have been in operation for a number of years, are licensed, and are provably fair, then your chance of finding a secure site is high. How do deposit bonuses work? Deposit bonuses come with a whole list of terms and conditions, which vary from site to site. Typical restrictions include they are only valid on specific games, or before you can withdraw, you have to wager the bonus amount X amount of times. It is common for table games not to qualify, and players have to wager the bonus amount over six times. Before claiming a bonus, you need to carefully read the terms and conditions. Deposit bonuses often look juicier than they actually are.
