He begged that, upon waking the next day, he would find himself in the middle of a wondrous fantasy. One day, his prayer was finally answered. Yet it took a shape that was nothing like what he had wished for. Where Immortals Once Walked 94% Ongoing In the shadows of gods and demons, a lone traveler traces where immortals once walked. Three thousand years ago, the Heavenly Demon descended. Immortals took action, triumphed, and successfully forced the Heavenly Demon to withdraw from the mortal realm. But afterward, countless calamities befell the world, spirit qi waned, and the immortals vanished. In their absence, the Heavenly Demon emerged once more, infiltrating the mortal realm with the identity of a god. Slightly over a hundred and sixty years ago, a divine artifact descended. The fertile Chipa Plateau withered, and the once-unconquerable Panlong Ancient City fell to ruin. Now, I have descended upon this world! Following the traces left behind by the immortals, I shall defy the fate that was set for me at birth! I shall unravel the mysteries surrounding immortals and demons... And it all begins with returning to Panlong City, to witness and experience its turbulent, tragic history. P.S. This is a discovery-driven story with no omniscient voice. The truths of the world reveal themselves only as discoveries are made. This novel is steeped in lived‑in history and free of worn‑out tropes. Immortality Simulator 90% Ongoing When Li Fan transmigrated into a new world, his life seemed unremarkable. He was moderately well-off, with a wife and children, but nothing extraordinary. Everything changed upon his death, when he awakened the ability Return to Truth: the power to virtualize an entire lifetime’s worth of experiences, run it as a simulation, and return to the age of twenty armed with that knowledge. With this ability in hand, Li Fan finally saw a chance to pursue the dream he had always harbored: eternal life. In other words, the path of immortal cultivation. But the world of cultivation was nothing like the paradise he imagined. After countless generations of cultivators plundering heaven and earth, the heavens had struck back. Mortals now carried the Immortal-Mortal Miasma within their blood, a disease that, when encountered by cultivators, led to cultivation decline and death. No technique could be practiced by more than a single person. Calamities descended from the Heavenly Dao without warning. In such a hostile world, where even the heavens themselves resist immortal cultivation, can Li Fan truly seize eternal life? Or will he meet his final end, his Dao dispersing back to heaven? Roadmap to the Boundless Sky 81% Ongoing One day, while visiting a museum, Chen Chuan glimpsed his reflection in a mirror and was transported to another world where martial artists were revered above all. Beside him lingered a silent second self, a ghostly twin that could fuse with him to amplify his strength and shield him from harm. Though he had never trained in martial arts, Chen Chuan set his sights on Martial Valor University, the gateway to power and the key to breaking free from a society where the rich held iron control over the rest. This path would lead him to clash against the elites, who would rather see him crushed than rise above them. Dawnless Sovereign 67% Ongoing A mission for justice that spans across two lifetimes, a fresh beginning that presents a new opportunity to succeed where he once failed. In a time of grave peril for a world on the brink of anarchy, a hero rises like a phoenix from its own ashes to offer a faint glimmer of hope. Armed with his wealth of knowledge and experience from his past life, as well as an almighty cultivation art obtained under mysterious circumstances, Fang Che sets out to exact vengeance on the Church of the Self-Righteous, a blight on the entire continent and the ones that had put an end to his past life. Daddy is too Strong 86% Ongoing The return of the Heavenly Demon! Despite having told himself that he would live the rest of his life in a peaceful, ordinary way… “Please become my father! Just until I graduate.” He suddenly found himself with a new daughter.
