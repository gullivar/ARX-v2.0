Why Protect Your Ad Spend Matters You’re not just losing 30% of your budget — you’re losing opportunity. Click fraud is more than bots. It’s competitor sabotage, click farms, and junk traffic that skews your paid media data and tanks your ROAS. Bot Clicks Bot Clicks Competitor Sabotage Competitor Sabotage Click Farms Click Farms Non-Converting Traffic Non-Converting Traffic Bot Clicks Automated scripts or fake users click your ads over and over, draining your paid advertising budget with zero real intent. They mimic human behavior just enough to slip past platforms, but all you get is wasted spend and skewed data. Competitor Sabotage Competitors click your ads to waste your budget, drive up CPCs, and push you out of auctions. Platforms won’t catch it, but your performance will feel it. Click Farms Thousands of low-quality clicks from real people paid pennies to interact with your ads, usually from countries you’re not even targeting. They drain spend and pollute your data. Non-Converting Traffic Not all fake traffic is fraud. Some clicks come from disinterested, low-intent users who will never buy, but still cost you.
