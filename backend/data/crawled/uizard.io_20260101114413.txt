What our customers say about us Elizabeth @DesignerUp I can't believe I just watched AI turn a boring text prompt into a complete UI design and flow right before my eyes in seconds with Uizard. Joelle @joelledesigner Uizard isn’t your average AI tool that overpromises and under delivers - it has actually useful features that are designed to speed up your design process. Carl @carlvellotti I'm so freaking impressed with Uizard. Design tool + AI = Magic 🪄 🔸 Instantly generate designs from a prompt or screenshot 🔸 Get a predictive heat map of where users will focus 🔸 Powerful design tool on its own Addina @byaddinaf Designers, don’t walk, run to uizard @uizard for their new AI feature: Autodesigners 🪄🏃🏻‍♀️💨 Autodesigner is their AI feature to generate design by text prompt! 🤯 I got a full access to try this feature myself! ⚡️🥰 ✏️ Choose the device 💡 Write prompt 👀 Choose the design style ⚡️ Generate 🪄 Like magic it’s ready for you 🤯 … and the component is editable!! John Vetans John Vetan Yesterday I was part of an exclusive group that got early access to #Autodesigner, Uizard’s new AI prototyping tool. Although still in Alpha, the demo was impressive, and the potential is tremendous, so we are adding this capability to our design sprint training program. Andre Andre Albuquerque One of the coolest products I’ve used lately used is called Uizard. It uses AI to automatically design & create mobile apps, web products and basically any product experience you can imagine with just a simple English prompt. No code. No design. No effort. It took me 60 seconds to create two products out of nowhere. Kyle @kanekallaway One of my favourite design platforms is called Uizard. Autodesigner is only 1 of 9 AI tools on the platform. And the AI tools are only a small sliver of what Uizard can do. David David Pereira Great tools like Uizard are available to empower PMs to boost learning. From zero to a clickable prototype in 30 seconds, that’s unbelievable.

Christopher Christopher Nguyen I’m absolutely shocked that more designers haven’t leveraged a tool like Uizard Designers can brainstorm quicker Designers can show concepts sooner Designers can turn inspo into editable UI Designers can test lots of iterations and flows Designers can spend more time talking to users AI means Product Managers can now do 80% of a UX Designer’s job. Joanna @joanna_socialnomad “With this AI tool you can create a beautiful website and app without costing you thousands of dollars on UX/UI designers. It’s called Uizard.” […] ”All you need is an idea and Uizard will make it happen.” Nolan Perkins @_radnolan @uizard just dropped a Figma plugin and I think it’s going to change my ui & ux design process! Uizard I think is going to help bridge the gap from idea to visualization which will help designers move faster, and product managers communicate better to their designers fostering better collaboration in the product team. Janus Tiu @janustiu Tried out this AI-powered UI design assistant tool today. It has a couple of amazing features including turning screenshots to wireframes, converting sketches into mock-ups and my favourite - an AI text writer 🙆🏻‍♀️ Ari @ux_ari You can now QUICKLY add new design features to your existing designs 🎉😲 I’m often working closely with senior stakeholders, and they find it challenging to visualise specific ideas I am proposing 😕 I usually try to mock up a wireframe quickly, but it isn’t as impactful as I would like. I also don’t have time to mock up anything higher fidelity as there just isn’t time ⏳😐 🚀 Uizard’s Autodesigner 1.5 has completely changed my process 🚀 Mili @mili.codes when an AI creates your website design ✨🔥 this amazing tool will help you create your UI in seconds ✨🌱 describe the device and what would you like to create and it will create the UI for you! Aadit Sheth Aadit Sheth I made an app mockup in 2 minutes (without knowing design or code). I saw this thing called "Autodesigner" that builds mockups from simple text. I typed "an app that is a community platform..." and this is what it came up with 🤯 I honestly think this is the future of product design. It took me less than 2 minutes to generate this mockup. I can generate 10 completely different ones in 20 minutes. This just changes the game for product teams.
