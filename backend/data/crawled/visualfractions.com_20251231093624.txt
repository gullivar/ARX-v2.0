Online Calculators and Tools by Visual Fractions

Visual Fractions started way back in 1999 as a way to help students learn about fractions and to understand them using interactive visual tools. Since then, we have expanded to become an online reference - covering fraction and math calculators, percentages, unit conversions, and more.

The main areas of the site can be explored below and we are adding more every week so please bookmark and check back later for new tools.

If you use any of the calculations, images, or snippets of content from Visual Fractions in your research or on your own website, please make sure to reference us as the source material and provide a link from your website. This helps us to keep the entire site free to use. There is a citation tool at the end of every single page on this site so you can quickly copy and paste.

We are continually developing the site and just launched a YouTube channel Visual Fractions and a Spanish version of our site. Check them out.
