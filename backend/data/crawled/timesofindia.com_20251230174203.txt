A satellite’s unlikely ride
1981
TOI take:
Published on: Nov 21, 2025
On June 19, 1981, Isro launched its first communication satellite, Apple, aboard Ariane-1 from Kourou in French Guiana. This satellite, iconically, was transported on a bullock cart—a reflection of Isro's humble beginnings—just six years after Aryabhatta, when both the agency and the nation’s infrastructure were still developing.

Published on: Oct 16, 2025
Taken by Pete Souza on May 1, 2011, the photo captures former US President Barack Obama and his national security team intensely monitoring Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. Obama later reflected that the moment was likely when they learned one of the raid’s helicopters had crashed.

TOI take:
Published on: Sep 25, 2025
In 1972, eight Black September militants attacked Munich’s Olympic Village, killing two Israelis and taking nine hostage. Their demand: release of 236 prisoners. A failed 20-hour rescue operation left all hostages, a policeman, and five terrorists dead. Strumpf’s photo of the masked man, shattering the Games' peace, came to epitomise the horrors of terrorism.
