FAQ
What is Rocket Apps?

Rocket Apps is a bundle of popular mobile Apps. Instead of paying a separate subscription for every App you pay one single subscription and get unlimited access to all our Apps.

How does it work?

Once you subscribed to Rocket Apps you can download all our Apps on the App Store and access them for free with your Rocket Apps account.

What platforms are available?

Currently most Rocket Apps are available for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. We are working hard on bringing our Apps to more platforms, especially Android.

Why is it so low-priced?

Typically developers charge around $5/month for every single App in our portfolio. However, we believe that by offering all Apps in one subscription users get much greater value and will decide to stay longer. This is better for you and better for us.

How can you build so many Apps?

Our team consists of App Store veterans who work on Apps since the App Store started. We have shipped dozens of Apps, 500 million downloads and even won Apple Design Awards. In short: we live and breathe Apps.
