Find the Right Hosting Plan For Your Website From shared hosting to dedicated servers, our plans are structured to support you at every stage of growth. Not sure which hosting type fits your business best? Here is more information so that you can choose the most suitable solution for you. Shared Hosting: Best for New & Smaller Websites Our Starter Hosting is designed as an entry-level plan: ideal for basic business websites, portfolios, or blogs with low-to-moderate traffic. Because many customer accounts share the same server, each account is given fair usage limits. This prevents any single website from consuming all the resources and ensures stable performance for everyone. Shared Hosting is the most affordable way to get started, and perfect for websites with light hosting needs. Explore Starter Hosting Here Business Hosting: For Growing Websites That Need More Power Business Hosting is designed for websites that need greater server resources to deliver content smoothly. Even if your site doesn’t get massive traffic, a larger product catalogue, high-resolution images, or heavier scripts can demand more CPU power than Starter Hosting can handle. With more resources allocated per account and fewer customers sharing each server, Business Hosting provides faster speeds, higher stability, and room to scale. Perfect for: Established e-commerce stores with bigger product ranges Popular blogs or content sites with media-rich pages Growing businesses that cannot afford slowdowns or downtime Business Hosting gives you the extra performance and reliability needed to support your growth without jumping straight to a dedicated server. Explore Business Hosting Here Dedicated Servers – For Full Control & Customised Performance Dedicated Servers are for businesses that want complete control over their hosting environment. Unlike shared or business hosting, you are not sharing resources with anyone else. The entire server is yours. This means you can: Customise specifications (CPU, RAM, storage, and software) to fit your exact needs Handle high-traffic or data-heavy applications with dedicated performance Run specialised setups that aren’t possible on shared environments Perfect for: Marketplace platforms and job boards with complex databases Large-scale e-commerce stores needing maximum speed and stability Businesses with specific compliance or configuration requirements Dedicated Servers give you unmatched performance and flexibility, with resources tailored exactly to your business. Explore Dedicated Server Plans Here FAQ About Website Hosting in Singapore What are the key factors to consider before choosing a hosting provider? When choosing website hosting in Singapore, focus on what will actually impact your business, not just the price tag. Here is what matters, and how to check them: Speed & Reliability – Ask what uptime guarantee is offered (look for at least 99.9%). You can also check reviews for mentions of slow websites or frequent downtime. Scalability – Confirm how easy it is to upgrade. Moving between different plan types (e.g. Starter → Business) requires migration, while upgrading within a plan (e.g. Starter 20 → Starter 40) is immediate and seamless. Security & Backups – Check if backups are included and whether SSL certificates are available. HostSG offers SSL as an add-on, so you can secure your website when you are ready. Support – Test their support before you buy. Submit a ticket or call during office hours to see how quickly they respond and how knowledgeable they are. Reputation – Look at independent reviews, or check if established businesses trust them. Longevity in the market is usually a good sign. A reliable hosting provider should be transparent about these details. If you can’t get clear answers, that is your answer. What makes HostSG different from other hosting providers in Singapore? Many hosting providers rely on limited network connections, which can affect speed and resilience. HostSG, however, has direct connectivity with major ISPs worldwide , ensuring faster and more reliable access for your users across Singapore, Asia, and beyond. This is despite the fact that all our servers are hosted locally in Singapore. We also offer: Enterprise-grade infrastructure at SME-friendly prices Responsive, customer-first support to guide you through setup, scaling, and troubleshooting Proven track record as one of Singapore’s longest-standing hosting providers, trusted by businesses of all sizes Do I need to be based in Singapore to register a .sg domain? Yes, registering a .sg domain requires a locally registered business or administrative contact. HostSG can guide you through the process and help manage your domain seamlessly. How fast will my website load with Singapore hosting? Website speed depends on many factors, including how your site is built, the size of your content, and the user’s own internet connection. However, hosting your website locally in Singapore generally means faster load times for visitors in Singapore and across Asia compared to hosting on overseas servers. Local hosting also helps with: Improved user experience – faster access keeps visitors engaged Better search performance – search engines reward sites that load quickly for local audiences Lower latency – users in Singapore connect directly to servers nearby, rather than routing traffic halfway across the world Can HostSG support my website as it grows? Absolutely. Our hosting solutions scale with you from shared hosting for new businesses, to business hosting for growing traffic, and dedicated servers for heavy data loads and millions of users. Can I host multiple websites on one hosting account? This depends on the hosting plan you choose. With HostSG’s Business Cloud Hosting, you can host multiple websites under a single account, making it convenient if you manage different sites (e.g. a company site, a blog, and an online store). For Starter Hosting, each account is designed to host one website. If you need to run multiple sites, we will guide you to the best plan that supports it without compromising performance. How easy is it to move my website to HostSG? We provide full migration support to help you move from your current hosting provider. Our team will handle the technical steps, from transferring files to reconfiguring your domain. so you don’t have to worry about the details. Do note that some downtime is usually required during the migration process. For most websites, this is around 1 to 3 hours , though larger websites with a lot of data may take longer. Either way, we will keep you updated throughout the process and work to minimise disruption as much as possible. Is local hosting in Singapore better than overseas hosting? For businesses targeting Singapore and Asia-Pacific customers, hosting locally often provides advantages. Because your servers are located closer to your visitors, websites generally load faster compared to hosting overseas. Local hosting also means: Lower latency for users in Singapore and nearby countries Support in your own timezone , so issues can be resolved more conveniently Peace of mind knowing your website is hosted within Singapore’s stable and well-connected infrastructure While actual website speed depends on many factors (such as site design, content size, and user connection), hosting locally is usually the smarter choice for businesses serving customers in Singapore and the region. What security features should I look for in a hosting plan? Security is a key part of choosing the right hosting provider. At HostSG, we provide: Daily backups (included with Starter and Business Hosting) with a 7-day retention period, so you can recover your site if something goes wrong. SSL certificates (available as an add-on) to secure your website and build visitor trust. Basic DDoS protection to guard against common cyberattacks. For very large or frequent DDoS attacks, no shared hosting provider can absorb the traffic without disruption. In such rare cases, we will advise on specialised solutions to ensure your business remains protected. Ready to Experience Better Website Hosting?
