...the Xen Panda travels through the universe, guiding users through the wonders of Xen virtualization.
Planet Data Center
Xen brings virtualization to a wide range of server environments, from data centers to enterprise IT, edge deployments, and labs. As an Open Source hypervisor, Xen powers a variety of platforms supported by both community and commercial contributors. Sub-projects like XCP-ng offer a drop-in solution built on Xen for those seeking a fully open and stable virtualization stack. Commercial offerings from Xen partners provide additional features, support, and long-term stability, all built on the same trusted core. Whether you're managing thousands of virtual machines or a single node on-premises, Xen provides the flexibility and stability to meet your needs.
Planet Automotive
Xen is powering innovation in automotive computing by enabling secure, efficient virtualization across in-vehicle systems. From dashboards and infotainment to safety-critical functions, Xen consolidates multiple operating systems onto a single SoC while preserving isolation and performance. It plays a key role in the Automotive Grade Linux Software-Defined Vehicle reference platform, supporting mixed-criticality workloads with VirtIO and real-time OSes like Zephyr. With long-term security support and a rigorous open CI system, Xen provides a trusted foundation for next-generation vehicles. Automotive partners across manufacturing and component sectors collaborate within the Xen ecosystem to advance software-defined mobility.
Planet Industrial
Xen is transforming industrial computing by enabling secure, efficient virtualization across embedded controllers, robotics, factory automation systems, and energy infrastructure. With real-time performance, low and deterministic interrupt latency, strong isolation, and minimal overhead, Xen allows manufacturers and operators to consolidate workloads and extend device lifecycles. The open CI network ensures compatibility with real-world hardware while supporting robust validation workflows essential in mission-critical environments, enabling predictive maintenance strategies. Industrial and energy sector partners can contribute and test directly within the Xen ecosystem, helping shape a resilient and flexible virtualization platform for modern operations.
Planet Consumer
Xen isn't just for servers and vehicles, it's empowering end-user systems too. Renowned security-focused projects like Qubes OS and OpenXT rely on Xen to provide hardware-enforced isolation on desktops and laptops, ensuring privacy and protection for advanced users and developers. Contributors from these communities even provide test hardware to the Xen CI network, reinforcing the platform's real-world reliability. Xen also powers home labs, small businesses, and university research environments, offering a secure, flexible virtualization stack for experimentation and innovation.
