TASCAM FR-AV 2

Tiny Form Factor—Excellent Sound

RECORDERS
Microtech Gefell M930Ts

The 930 Ts is clearly a polished and modern VO performer; there's nothing "classic", "vintage", or "tubey" about it. Which is the perfect scenario for the majority of VO assignments. You will simply never regret having this mic, and you'll sadly miss it if it is ever gone.
