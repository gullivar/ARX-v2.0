Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.

Easy installation

Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Linux, macOS and other Unix-like operating systems.

Easy configuration

Jenkins can be easily set up and configured via its web interface, which includes on-the-fly error checks and built-in help.

Plugins

With hundreds of plugins in the Update Center, Jenkins integrates with practically every tool in the continuous integration and continuous delivery toolchain.

Extensible

Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture, providing nearly infinite possibilities for what Jenkins can do.

Distributed

Jenkins can easily distribute work across multiple machines, helping drive builds, tests and deployments across multiple platforms faster.

Automating Jenkins on Android with Infrastructure as Code

From Manual to Automated In March 2023, I explored running Jenkins on Android devices using Termux, demonstrating that it’s technically possible to transform aging smartphones into CI/CD infrastructure. The manual setup worked, but it required 2-3 hours of configuration and was error-prone. Fast-forward to 2025: I’ve automated the entire process using Infrastructure as Code principles. What once took hours of manual configuration...

Advancing the Jenkins Tekton Client Plugin through CRD Generation, JUnit 5 Modernization, and Automated CI
