Hear from Leading Brands
“We were honestly nervous about the migration. Our customers had accumulated points and tier status over months, and we couldn’t afford to lose that data or break their trust. Joy’s team handled it flawlessly—nobody even noticed we switched platforms.”
To Quang Vu
CIO | Levents
“Joy has significantly boosted our revenue growth and enhanced the overall customer experience with our brand, especially through the ‘Points-to-Rewards’ program.”
The Tinsel Rack team
“Avada SEO automatically optimized my titles, meta descriptions, and image sizes. I especially loved the image ALT automation — a total time-saver. The SEO audit tool made it easy to know what to fix, and the support team is quick and reliable.”
MakeByMoon
“I am extremely pleased with the level of integration with Shopify and how easy it is to set up the AI and the chat functionality itself.”
