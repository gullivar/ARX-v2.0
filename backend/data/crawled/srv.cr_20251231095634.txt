The self-service capability they offered gave us the confidence and support needed for a seamless transition, ensuring uninterrupted service for our partners and end-users. Mwai Mworia CEO of M-PAYA Energy Before migrating to Servercore, we struggled with high costs and inefficiencies in scaling our resources, leading to frequent downtimes. Now, we benefit from cost-effective solutions like tailored servers and managed databases, allowing us to efficiently manage and scale our traffic. Caleb Chege CTO of Uzapoint Servercore solutions have been crucial to our company launch. Our initial server costs were significantly high. With Servercore, we have achieved savings of up to 43% on server expenses. Their exceptional customer support and efficiency give us the confidence to approach the market knowing we have solid backing. Additionally, their local support ensures prompt assistance, minimizing downtime. Kalvin Omollo CEO of GoDeliveries While automating our business processes, we sought a reliable provider with affordable server prices and were recommended Servercore. We are pleased with the service quality, payment terms, and prompt technical support through their ticketing system. Mansur Sharapov Head of the IT Department Servercore’s staff actively assisted us with the migration, enabling us to move to the cloud within a month without any difficulties. After the successful IT infrastructure testing, we gradually started transferring all our cloud servers from the previous provider to Servercore. Currently, all servers are successfully running in Servercore’s cloud and assisting us in scaling our business. Sardorbek Bayakhmedov Project Office Head In 2022, we discovered Servercore’s flexible cloud services in Uzbekistan which exceeded our expectations. After launching several test projects, we quickly realised the infrastructure’s adaptability and exceptional reliability.
