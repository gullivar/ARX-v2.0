TV Recaps
MAYOR OF KINGSTOWN (S4/E10)
This Damned Show Despite the satisfying death of the season’s big bad, who goes out whimpering, the season ends with a sputter rather than a bang.
LANDMAN (S2/E7)
Never Grow Up A romantic (but weird) episode gets introspective, profound, and absurd.
STRANGER THINGS (S5/E7)
One Last Crawl The team puts Steve’s operation into action, but time is running out. It’s November 6th, and Vecna has plans of his own.
HEATED RIVALRY (S1/E6)
Silent Retreat It only took roughly seven years for Shane and Ilya’s relationship to reach this point, but it was worth the wait.
STRANGER THINGS (S5/E6)
Vessel, Builder, Sorcerer, Spy While Dustin’s discovery about the Upside Down has existential implications for Hawkins (and the world), the team has more pressing matters at hand.
STRANGER THINGS (S5/E5)
Plugged In Nothing can go wrong with three teams across two dimensions trying to execute a million different plans, right?
FALLOUT (S2/E2)
A Real F*ckin’ Ice Box Lucy finds herself in the midst of one of the most dangerous factions in the entire series.
PLURIBUS (S1/E9)
The Last Temptation of Carol An impeccably wrought finale finds Carol allowing herself to consider the bliss of surrender versus making a hard sacrifice for mankind.
BELOW DECK MEDITERRANEAN (S10/E13)
Take Two There’s a storm coming. Personal relationships are falling apart. The guests are insane. There is poop in the shower.
