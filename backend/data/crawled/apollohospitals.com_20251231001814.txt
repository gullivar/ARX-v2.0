From Pain To Freedom

From Pain to Freedom! Hear the heartfelt words of gratitude from our patient’s family, made possible by the exceptional care and expertise of Dr. Rajasekhar K. T and his team.

B SRINIVASA SHETTY
Ajai Kumar Srivastava

I am a 58-year-old mechanical engineer who was suffering from O/A since 2018. I visited Dr. Manish Samson for robotic-assisted bilateral TKR Surgery. Both knee surgeries were performed on 10.08.24 and 12.08.24. Besides a few initial hardships, now after one month I am feeling much relaxed and slowly started walking and climbing stairs independently. I am thankful to Dr. Manish Samson for his kind support and advice in my whole medical journey. I found him to be an excellent surgeon and kind human being.

Kavita Sharma

My mother had severe osteoarthritis in both knees, causing her significant pain and difficulty in performing daily activities. A colleague recommended Dr. Raviraj, who had successfully treated her mother with knee replacement surgery. Dr. Raviraj was incredibly approachable and took the time to explain the entire procedure, including the benefits of robotic surgery, in detail. My mother underwent a robotic bilateral total knee replacement, and her post-operative recovery was smooth and uneventful. Dr. Raviraj's expertise, empathy, and approachability, along with the support of his dedicated team, made our journey to recovery seamless and reassuring.

Dear Dr. Jayanti, I want to thank you for the exceptional care you provided during my lumpectomy. Your precise surgical skills and compassionate approach laid the foundation for my recovery and every medical professional since has praised your work. Despite initial challenges with my treatment, I’m thrilled to share that I’ve completed chemotherapy and will soon begin radiation and hormone therapy. Your expertise has been a constant source of strength throughout this journey.

Real Stories Of Healing

I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids and advised to undergo Myomectomy. After consulting various doctors, an expert urologist recommended Dr. Rohit Madhurkar. He suggested Uterine Fibroid Embolization (UFE), a non-surgical procedure. Dr. Rohit explained everything clearly, and I felt at ease. After UFE, I was able to walk and work the next day, which wouldn't have been possible with Myomectomy. My mother also had UFE three months ago and is now healthy and fit. UFE has truly been a life-changing decision for us, offering a minimally invasive alternative to surgery.

Trisha Gandhi

Dr. Sridhar is a lifesaver. My father was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and given only six months. Thankfully, we found Dr. Sridhar, and after Cyberknife treatment, my father's condition improved rapidly. He returned to a normal life after one year.
