How is HypeLab different from other advertising platforms? HypeLab is a Web3-native ad network—designed specifically for crypto brands. Unlike Web2 platforms or direct buys that require manual negotiation, we serve ads where actual crypto users are. Additionally, because we're programmatic, you get access to high-quality inventory at scale—without the premium costs of going direct. That means lower CPMs, better targeting, and faster time to launch. Where will my ads appear? Ads appear natively inside high-traffic Web3 products—wallets, dApps, NFT marketplaces, and other crypto applications. These are hand-selected partners with real users and engaged traffic, not junk inventory. What formats are available? We support clean ad formats—banner units and native placements—that blend seamlessly into the Web3 UI. No sketchy pop-ups or forced redirects. We support a wide range of image and video sizes, including 1456x180, 640x100, 640x200, 600x500, and 1200x630. How quickly can I launch an advertising campaign? Setup time will vary depending on your needs. For instance, if you have your ad images and copy ready, you can launch a campaign in as little as 10 minutes using our self-serve platform. Will we have a dashboard to access all of our campaign performance metrics? Yes. Our reporting tooling shows all top-of-funnel activity like impressions, clicks, click through rate (CTR), and cost per mille (CPM). What forms of payment does HypeLab accept? We accept credit card payments, crypto payments, and traditional bank / wire transfers. What is the difference between advertising and publishing? Can we do both? Advertisers are the brands that are trying to amplify their brand or product through display ads - they will be featured on the advertisements. The publishers are the websites or dApps that are showing the ads (e.g., Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, etc.). Yes, you can do both! We have multiple clients who work with us on both the advertising and the publishing side. What regions of the world do you serve, and what devices can you target? Our inventory reaches a global audience and we provide targeting controls that let you pick which countries you would like to serve ads to as well as the ones you would like to exclude. We can target mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. Contact our sales team . Got questions or ready to get started? Our sales team is here to help.
