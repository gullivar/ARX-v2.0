nip.io is now hosted by sslip.io. This page, the original nip.io page, is kept as a memorial to the late, great Roopinder Singh, who created & ran nip.io.

Watch out! The behavior has changed. For example, parsing is done from left to right instead of right to left (e.g. "1.127.0.0.1.nip.io" resolves to "1.127.0.0" not "127.0.0.1" ).

nip.io
Dead simple wildcard DNS for any IP Address

Stop editing your etc/hosts file with custom hostname and IP address mappings.

nip.io allows you to do that by mapping any IP Address to a hostname using the following formats:

Without a name:

10.0.0.1.nip.io maps to 10.0.0.1
192-168-1-250.nip.io maps to 192.168.1.250
0a000803.nip.io maps to 10.0.8.3

With a name:

app.10.8.0.1.nip.io maps to 10.8.0.1
app-116-203-255-68.nip.io maps to 116.203.255.68
app-c0a801fc.nip.io maps to 192.168.1.252
customer1.app.10.0.0.1.nip.io maps to 10.0.0.1
customer2-app-127-0-0-1.nip.io maps to 127.0.0.1
customer3-app-7f000101.nip.io maps to 127.0.1.1

nip.io maps <anything>[.-]<IP Address>.nip.io in "dot", "dash" or "hexadecimal" notation to the corresponding <IP Address>:

dot notation: magic.127.0.0.1.nip.io
dash notation: magic-127-0-0-1.nip.io
hexadecimal notation: magic-7f000001.nip.io

The "dash" and "hexadecimal" notation is especially useful when using services like LetsEncrypt as it's just a regular sub-domain of nip.io

Troubleshooting
DNS Rebinding Protection

Some DNS resolvers, forwarders and routers have DNS rebinding protection which may result in failure to resolve local and private IP addresses. This service won't work in those situations.
