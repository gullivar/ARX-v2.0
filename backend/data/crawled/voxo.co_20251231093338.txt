This is the best phone system I have worked with through my career in pharmacy and anytime there are little hiccups (wouldn't even call them problems!) their IT team is immediate to respond and correct the concern! I will recommend this company to anyone that will listen!!” Lori MaRay Professional Arts Pharmacy "Converting a pharmacy with multiple phone lines and 100 employees made me anxious because technology conversions never go as smoothly as planned, but the VOXO team outdid themselves. The experience of our team improved immediately and the metrics already show the impact of the new system! THANK YOU!" 50 Saved monthly Modern Communication. A Quieter Pharmacy. Zero Contracts.
