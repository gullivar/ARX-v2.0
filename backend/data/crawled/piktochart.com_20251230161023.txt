What our users think of us
VENUS WONG
Psychologist and Affiliated Scholar

“If I don't have Piktochart, I have to go back to Photoshop or Illustrator and it will take me a longer time just to put a photo into a particular shape and frame.”

THEODORE PAAT
Instructional Designer at Affirm

“I did a lot of research on different platforms, and Piktochart stood out because it offered just as many features as others but at the right price—more for less.”

ANNE PAYUAN
Co-Founder

“We started The Bright Millennial just to market ourselves online. Now, we've grown to 300,000 followers, and it's become our full-time business.”

KERRY TOTTINGHAM
Co-Director a Brilliant Thing

“We didn't pay for any design work on The Brilliant Box because we used Piktochart to do it ourselves. I guess that was the most cost-effective product because we sell it. It's got a good margin on it, and it didn't actually cost us. It's only cost us the production fees.”

ROB REX
CEO of Chelan Valley Heating & Cooling

“Instead of paying for 10 different programs, we just pay for one… Because if you're using four different things, you can't be great at four things as opposed to just one you're awesome at.”

LARISSA CROCKETT
Neighborhood Housing Trust

“I think that we can say honestly that Piktochart is one of the reasons why that has been more successful because it's helping to create more engaging content.”

MARTA OLSZEWSKA
Co-Founder and CEO, Refill Aqua

“We will continue using Piktochart to grow our brand presence and to help educate people about a more sustainable lifestyle every single day.”

THOMAS TRIP
Language Specialist at Booking.com

“Now we have a project database where everything is logged and represented visually, so that people can click and see infographics that provide an easy to understand overview.”

JULIA GÓMEZ ACUÑA
CEO, Dear Content

“If you’re working on a long format guide and you can offer your client to re-purpose it into a beautiful whitepaper, lead magnet, or even a course, you will give them a feeling that they are maximizing every cent they spend with you.”

LLOYD PARKER
Vice President Programs & Solutions

“We were paying a lot of money to get this caliber of graphic support prior to Piktochart. Now we’ve eliminated all that cost and a fraction of the time.”

JESSE STRINGER
Research Analyst

“Our community benefits when they can understand what's happening in the corrections system. Visuals make that possible.”

KARIN REX
Instructional Designer

“What I find with Piktochart is it helps with the aesthetics. It helps me look like I have some sort of graphic design background. It makes what I create look good. That's what I needed. And it was a perfect tool at the perfect time for me.”

DR. AARON FISCHER
Professor of School Psychology

“I think I can do things in a way that just seems so easy, especially when I think back as a kid growing up trying to make presentations on PowerPoint. The features that are embedded in Piktochart take the sort of the grid locking to it for me to like a different level. So, I love that because I'm all about the symmetry as much as possible.”

JAMIE BARKIN
English and AP Literature Teacher

“A lot of the time if you've started down one road, you're sort of boxed in. With Piktochart, I can customize block sizes and suddenly it's exactly what I needed. I love that.”

DEBORAH TAN
Revolut

“It's really a no-brainer to use, I would say. People have told me to try another infographics design platform that is very world-renowned, but I tried it before and I didn't really like the feel and the way it works. Despite several attempts to try to pull me away, I always come back to Piktochart. I think it goes back to the great design of Piktochart.”

VENUS WONG

Create visuals for communications

It’s a pretty hard task when you’re trying to take 500 words and put them into one image. We found Piktochart as a solution to help convey information in an engaging manner. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in important meetings and if I didn’t have visual communication to talk about the impact of the work, I’m convinced that I would not be able to have secured funding to support the work that we do.

Dr. Aaron Fischer

Dee Endowed Professor of School Psychology at University of Utah

Piktochart has been beneficial in my classes where I teach 9th and 12th graders. When there are more difficult concepts or when we’re doing something that’s just not that interesting, Piktochart gets the kids to stay more engaged for a longer period of time. Plus with the way Piktochart’s interface is set up, I can hyperlink things and can make designs function in different ways.

Jamie Barkin

English and AP Literature Teacher at Wheaton High School

Piktochart has really changed the way that we look and operate as a business and being a small consulting firm, we’re competing in spaces with some of the big time professional firms who have full out graphic shops. And what we can produce now rivals what they produce. Piktochart is kind of my best kept secret. We were paying a lot of money to get this caliber of graphic support prior to Piktochart. Now we’ve eliminated all that cost and a fraction of the time.

Lloyd Parker

Vice President Programs & Solutions at T. White Parker Associates

For a small startup trying to make a big impact in Barcelona, having platforms like Piktochart in our toolkit is essential. Since day one of our operations, we’ve used it to get our message across, build awareness about the plastic problem and our solution to it, and pitch to investors. We landed strategic partnerships thanks to powerful visual storytelling and pitch decks that spoke more than words.
