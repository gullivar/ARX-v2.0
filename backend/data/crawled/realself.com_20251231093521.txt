Real Answers Browse millions of expert answers from the RealSelf doctor community ASK YOUR OWN QUESTION 60 MORE POUNDS TO LOSE. WOULD A TUMMY TUCK AND LIPO BE BENEFICIAL? Asked by: Loving979103 in Madison, Alabama ANSWERS ( 29 ) FEATURED ANSWER It's best to hold off on a tummy tuck until you're closer to your goal weight because losing more weight can lead to additional loose skin…. However, if hanging skin is making things difficult for you now, a panniculectomy that removes just the overhanging skin could be an option. Morad Askari, MD, MBA Board Certified Plastic Surgeon 4.8 | 98 Reviews SEE PROFILE WILL A MOMMY MAKEOVER IMPROVE MY FIGURE? SHOULD I ADD IMPLANTS? Asked by: missmaddy1992 in Ames, Iowa ANSWERS ( 25 ) FEATURED ANSWER You look to be a great candidate for a mommy makeover! The abdominoplasty will remove the excess tissue and midline scar and create a slim and contoured midsection…. If you are happy with the overall volume of your breasts, then a breast lift would be sufficient. Christine Fisher, MD, FACS Board Certified Plastic Surgeon 5 | 41 Reviews SEE PROFILE SAGGING CHEEKS AND LOWER FACE. DO I NEED A FACELIFT? Asked by: alexa_bil97 in Hometown, New York ANSWERS ( 17 ) FEATURED ANSWER You are a beautiful young woman and therefore have multiple options. You could consider filler, fat transfer, skin tightening devices or surgery. The deep plane facelift is the best way to rejuvenate both the midface and the lower face as well as the neck. Jill Hessler, MD Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon 4.9 | 124 Reviews SEE PROFILE IS MY NOSE GOING TO BE MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE TO WORK ON? Asked by: emily7789 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ANSWERS ( 20 ) FEATURED ANSWER Your nose does not look so complicated that it would require any additional cartilage, cost and/or effort to achieve a reasonable result. If you are self-conscious about your nose, be aware of the healing afterward and that your nose will take a while to show its final result. Lexie Wang, MD Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon, Board Certified Otolaryngologist 5 | 21 Reviews SEE PROFILE CANDIDATE FOR LIPOSUCTION POST-PREGNANCY? Asked by: bjh1995 in Scotland, United Kingdom ANSWERS ( 15 ) FEATURED ANSWER It looks like you are a candidate for liposuction. To minimize the risk of loose skin, you could also consider adding Renuvion, which is done at the same time and uses superheated helium gas to tighten the tissue from under the surface of the skin. Dana Goldberg, MD Board Certified Plastic Surgeon 4.9 | 82 Reviews SEE PROFILE PROS AND CONS OF LIPOSUCTION WITH ARM LIFT? Asked by: mariefl ANSWERS ( 12 ) FEATURED ANSWER The main advantage of doing both procedures together is that it allows for more complete contouring. Liposuction removes unwanted fat, while the arm lift tightens and removes sagging skin, resulting in a smoother and more toned appearance. Michael A. Fallucco, MD, FACS Board Certified Plastic Surgeon 4.9 | 27 Reviews SEE PROFILE UPPER BLEPHAROPLASTY OR BROW LIFT? Asked by: 42jade in Australia, AU ANSWERS ( 11 ) FEATURED ANSWER I would recommend a combination approach. A brow lift would reposition the brows and create an eye opening effect. However, alone, this will not have an effect on your upper eyelids. An upper blepharoplasty will address hooding.
