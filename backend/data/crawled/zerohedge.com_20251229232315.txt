EUROPE RALLIES, HEDGE FUNDS SELL ANYWAY

Continue to overstay

We continue to stay long our macro tourist trade in Europe. The theme continues to be "it will continue to get less worse". We find incremental support for the trade when looking at the latest hedge fund data - as positioning is very low. Will 2026 be Europe's year finally? Strongly doubt it, but we continue to hold on to this low risk low return trade.

SILVER GOES FULL METAL: 1979 VIBES

Smashing Pumpkins’ 1979 is loaded with nostalgia, regime change, and end-of-cycle energy — themes that map uncomfortably well onto silver today. A year ago, silver was about recovery and valuation. Now it’s momentum, volume explosions, and 1979 echoes — signs we’re likely closer to the later innings, where spikes are sold, not chased.

MORGAN STANLEY: THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE ALRIGHT

The rumors of excess are greatly exaggerated. No one ever really worried whether hedge funds were “alright.” But the latest data from Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage desk shows they are — diversified, low beta, and far from all-in on AI. Positioning looks responsible, not euphoric, and crowding is more myth than fact.

THE AI OUROBOROS

While markets argue about rates, geopolitics, and whether the Fed is “done,” the real story is happening elsewhere — quietly, relentlessly, and with very little regard for old rules. Welcome to our new series "The Week in AI", where this week examines how capital concentration accelerates, valuations detach from reality, and Big Tech starts investing in all sides of the same trade.

A 10-SIGNAL CLUSTER-F*CK

Stretch-marks

Eight straight green months. Hedge fund leverage above the 90th percentile. Sentiment stretched, cash at record lows, and strategists unanimously bullish. Ten indicators say the same thing: risk is too one-sided.
