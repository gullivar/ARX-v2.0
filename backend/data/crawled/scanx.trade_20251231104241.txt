Scanx - to help you express your trading & investing idea, to help you analyse the markets better. Stock Markets are the true indicator of the growth of any country's economy. We are bullish on India, we are bullish on India's prospects to be one of largest economies of the world. We believe that Stock Markets provide an unique opportunity for all Indians to participate in the growth story of India. We are enabling the same for Indians. As financial services are becoming more accessible, there is now a large set of Indians today who are financially aware and literate. They value time and seek high quality products & services. Most screening, trading, investing platforms available today are more or less similar to each other, and they have not evolved with time. While both traders & investors have gotten smart about how they make money and build wealth, as users they have continued to use the same products, features, and platforms that were available for years with little or no innovation. We plan to change that - a technology-led platform built for super traders and long term investors. © 2025 Raise Securities Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved.
