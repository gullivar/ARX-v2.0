What Makes Gab Different

We're not just another social network. We're a platform built on principles that matter.

Freedom of Speech & Reach

All First Amendment protected speech is welcome. No algorithmic throttling or shadow banning like other platforms.

Family-Friendly Platform

We maintain a clean environment. Explicit adult content has no place here and is strictly prohibited.

Western Nations Only

Third-world IPs are blocked. No scammers, no spam farms. A social network built for Western civilization.

Funded By Users

Our users are our investors, advertisers, and customers. You're not the product being sold to corporations.

Battle Tested

A decade of standing strong against censorship. Banned from app stores, banks, and payment processors—and still here.

American Owned & Operated

We reject foreign censorship demands. No foreign government dictates our policies. Built by Americans, for free people.

Banned From App Stores Since 2017
Get Gab On Your Phone

You won't find Gab on the Apple App Store or Google Play. We've been banned since 2017 for refusing to censor speech that Big Tech demanded we remove. But you can still get our app on your phone—and it works just as well as any native app.

Being banned from app stores for nearly a decade shows how serious we are about defending free speech. We also reject all foreign censorship demands and data requests for so-called "hate speech" from foreign nations. On Gab your speech stays protected and we have the scars to prove it.
