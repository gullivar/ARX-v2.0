This is completely unsolicited praise, @NordVPN, is very helpful as an advertiser testing search ads, and as a work-anywhere person who needs to ensure I have a safe internet connection. Great value. So easy to use, I actually use it. Keep up the good work.

What is a VPN?

VPN definition: A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool that protects your online activity from spying eyes. It makes your data safer from cybercriminals by encrypting your internet traffic and sending it through a secure tunnel. Every time you go online, your data is routed through a remote VPN server first. This way, it changes your IP address and virtual location, giving you safer and more private access to the internet.
