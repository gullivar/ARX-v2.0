Read more What Our Clients & Alumni Are Saying For our core leader training program, we combined key organizational knowledge and skill needed, with the powerhouse of the CCL name and years of extensive research in the leadership field , to offer a distinguished, holistic program to our leaders — one we believe is definitely ‘Best in Class. ’” Buffy Morris Director of Learning & Development Arch Mortgage Insurance Company The whole experience has given us leadership muscle to do things we didn’t think were possible. CCL has been a part of this success by helping us build leadership capabilities to take advantage of opportunities and create value for the shareholders.” Rob Van Nus VP, Human Resources & Corporate Services Graymont CCL has given us a theoretical framework for dramatically rethinking our organization and how we get the work done, as well as the tools and strategies for translating that framework into action. They do not have a ‘canned’ approach. They know us and our challenges, tailor their programming, and shift as we need them to with speed and consistently high quality of delivery. The gold standard for executive education and professional development. ” Paul LeBlanc President Southern New Hampshire University What I learned can be taken into the workplace, and I can also apply it to how I’m talking to my family and to people around me every day. I think CCL has done a great job of utilizing the knowledge that they have and the technology that’s out there and leveraging that together in a way that allows engagement for participants and advocates for the learner’s perspective.” Edwin Moy Learning & Development Manager Alteryx With such a diverse group from multiple time zones and different countries, we wanted to steer away from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to leadership development. The virtual experience [with CCL] was the best solution for our needs.” Gloriana Garro Director of People Development & Learning Crowley Maritime Early in my career and shortly after my promotion to management, I had the chance to attend an intensive, life-changing learning experience with the Center for Creative Leadership. Fortunately for me, I worked with a team that valued and prioritized leadership development and early into the role gave me that opportunity.” Tameca Brown Learning & Organizational Development Manager Fairfax County Government The experience only gets better with time.  I have been to a lot of leadership programs and conferences and this was by far the best … an environment where people were able to commit themselves for a week, be vulnerable, and look inward. It has made me a better leader for my organization and better in tune with the people that serve the mission .” Jared Kittelson CEO Foundation for Blind Children Subscribe to Get Our Latest Subscribe to our email newsletters that highlight our latest research-based articles, products, programs and more to help you strengthen your leadership skills.
