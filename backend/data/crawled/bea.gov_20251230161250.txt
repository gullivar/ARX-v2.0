Gross Domestic Product, 3rd Quarter 2025 (Initial Estimate) and Corporate Profits (Preliminary)

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025 (July, August, and September), according to the initial estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 3.8 percent. The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, and government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased.

Source Data: The Foundation for Valuable Economic Statistics
December 17, 2025 | The BEA Wire

A blog post from BEA Director Vipin Arora

I’ve always thought that a good analogy for the way we develop our economic estimates at BEA is how a master watchmaker constructs a watch. The watchmaker starts with a blueprint for the design of the watch, just as we begin with the methods of our world-leading economic accounts. Based on that design, the watchmaker carefully selects and assembles the components of the watch. Similarly,…

BEA’s Long History of Measuring Direct Investment: Critical Intel for Global Strategies
December 8, 2025 | The BEA Wire

A blog from BEA Director Vipin Arora

During the 1920s, Americans began investing more abroad than other countries were investing in the United States. This marked an important shift in U.S. foreign investment, and reversed the pattern seen before World War I. Around the same time, BEA began producing direct investment statistics—both U.S. direct investment abroad, or USDIA, and foreign direct investment in the United States, or…
