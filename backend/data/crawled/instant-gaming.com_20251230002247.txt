Gamer reviews
je acheter le jeux impossible de le retrouve ou que ce soit micorsfot store il n existe pas impossible de mettre la clé dans steam , ell est deja utilisé bref de la grosse merde et comment recuperai l argent maintenant !!!
This gave me the definitive edition on steam, which comes with three DLC's so be mindful that you don't buy those DLC's before checking!! I made the mistake of buying this game with some of the DLC's and ended up with duplicates I could not activate cus they already came with the definitive edition!
Il gioco è una bomba, attenzione. Essendo un sandbox ha bisogno di qualche run di esplorazione per capirne le meccaniche e i giusti incastri così da poter imparare a giocare. Una volta fatto ciò però diventa bellissimo. Godetevelo
Pra ser sincero, eu fiquei com medo de comprar aqui na Instant, mas quando eu finalizei o pagamento, o jogo ja foi liberado na hora.
Mas falando do jogo em si, o jogo e muito bom, e por esse preco da Instant, esta valendo super a pena comprar, o jogo e antigo mas continua sendo otimo nos dias de hoje.
