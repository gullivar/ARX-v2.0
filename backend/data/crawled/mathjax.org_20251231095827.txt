          organization, please contact us regarding our consultancy services. Features and Benefits High-quality typography MathJax uses CSS with web fonts
            or SVG, instead of bitmap images (like PNG, JPG or GIF), so equations scale with surrounding text at
            all zoom levels. View Samples Modular Input & Output MathJax is highly modular on input
            and output. Use MathML, TeX, and ASCIImath as input and produce HTML+CSS, SVG, or MathML
            as output. Try a live demo Accessible & reusable MathJax works with
            screenreaders & provides expression zoom and interactive exploration.
            You also can copy equations into Office, LaTeX, wikis, and other software. Learn more Samples Our homepage is configured to use MathJax's CommonHTML mode with web fonts to display the
          equations, which produces uniform layout and typesetting across browsers. But MathJax can
          also be configured to use HTML-CSS (for legacy browsers), SVG, and native MathML rendering
          when available in a browser. You can try the various output modes using the MathJax
          context Menu (which you access by ctrl+clicking / alt-clicking / right-clicking an equation)
          or the menu below. Select the rendering mode: CommonHTML SVG The Quadratic Formula \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\] Cauchy's Integral Formula \[f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint\frac{f(z)}{z-a}dz\] Angle Sum Formula for Cosines \[ \cos(\theta+\phi)=\cos(\theta)\cos(\phi)−\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi) \] Gauss' Divergence Theorem \[ \int_D ({\nabla\cdot} F)dV=\int_{\partial D} F\cdot ndS \] Curl of a Vector Field \[ \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{F} =
            \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{i}
          + \left( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \right) \mathbf{j}
          + \left( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right) \mathbf{k} \] Standard Deviation \[\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\mu)^2} \] Definition of Christoffel Symbols \[(\nabla_X Y)^k = X^i (\nabla_i Y)^k =
           X^i \left( \frac{\partial Y^k}{\partial x^i} + \Gamma_{im}^k Y^m \right)\] Live Demo Type text in the box below.  Include some math: enter MathML as MathML tags, and wrap TeX in $...$ or $$...$$ delimiters (or \(...\) and \[...\] ), and AsciiMath in `...` delimiters.  The text you enter
        is actually HTML, so you can include tags if you want; but this also means you have to be
        careful how you use less-than signs, ampersands, and other HTML special characters within
        your math (surrounding them by spaces should be sufficient). When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ Preview is shown here: Accessibility and reuse. Accessibility MathJax provides a powerful set of accessibility extensions that
          provide navigation, exploration, and voicing on the client. You can find more information in our introductory
         video on YouTube and our documentation . Reuse Using the MathJax context menu, you can access the source of any mathematical expression
          either in MathML format, or in its original format if that was TeX or AsciiMath. To access the MathJax menu, right-click on a math formula (if you are using Windows), or
          Control-click it (if you are using a Mac) or touble-tap and hold on a touch device.  In
          the sub-menu “ Show Math as ” you can choose between “ MathML Code ” and
          “ TeX commands ” to get a pop-up that allows you to copy the math source into
          another application.  Try it out on the equation below! \[ \left [ – \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V \right ] \Psi =
            i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi \] You can also watch our screencast on YouTube of
          a MathJax equation being copied and pasted into a variety of applications. Note that
          this screencast is based on MathJax v1.1 so the menu structure is a little different in
          the current version. Getting Started Web Integration Whether you're a casual user, a serious author, or a professional developer, it's easy to
            integrate MathJax. Start now Server Integration Our node package allows you to use MathJax on the server or
              integrate it into your development workflow. Install now Works everywhere MathJax generates high-quality output on all major browsers & platforms. Check our overview A rich API Use our extensive APIs to create interactive content, advanced authoring tools, and
            math-enabled web and mobile apps. Dive deeper Bugs, Issues, Code We host our code, docs, and this site on GitHub. Please report
            issues & submit
            patches ! Visit us on GitHub General Support You can ask general questions on the MathJax-Users mailing
            list where the entire community can chime in. Learn more Simple integration Adding MathJax to your web pages is easy to do. If you are using a Content Management System (like Wordpress, Moodle, or Drupal) to generate
        your web site, there may be a plugin to add MathJax to your site already, e.g., for Wordpress or Drupal .  You may need to download or
        activate the plugin, if one is available. If you are using specialized authoring tools, such as LaTeX or Markdown, they might
        integrate MathJax out of the box or have plugins, e.g., for LaTeX , Markdown , or even epub . Using MathJax version 4 If you write your own HTML (directly or via a template/theme engine), you can include
        MathJax by adding this snippet to your page: <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@4/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> Here's a pre-populated example on jsbin you can re-use. Note: the configuration file tex-mml-chtml.js is a great way
        to test both TeX and MathML input options at once. You can find leaner combined
        components in our documentation. If you use the snippet above, you will not need to change the version number in the src attribute every time the version of MathJax changes.  If you want to always
        use a specific version, then use a reference like <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@4.0.0/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> Here's a pre-populated example on jsbin you can re-use. Jump to our v4 docs Using MathJax version 2 MathJax version 2 is still available, and you can continue to use that if you wish.  To load MathJax
        version 2 into your page, use this snippet: <script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@2/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_CHTML"></script> More information is available in the version 2 documentation at the link below. Jump to our v2 docs Server Integration If you prefer to render server-side, MathJax version 3 and above makes that easy
        as well. MathJax is available as a node package, which is easy to
        install via node's package manager npm using the command npm install mathjax Alternatively, MathJax is available on Packagist . Just
      add the following line to your require section in the composer.json file of your project "mathjax/mathjax": "4.*" Or simply download a
        copy of the latest distribution. This allows you to run MathJax on
        your server and configure it yourself.  There are plenty of examples on
        how to use and configure MathJax for node in our MathJax
        Node Demos repository. If you are a developer who wants to integrate MathJax more tightly into
        your development workflow, you can use our full code node package
        available npm with npm install mathjax-full Or simply download
        the source code directly. Getting
      started with Node A rich set of APIs Our extensive APIs allow developers to create everything from interactive content, to
          advanced authoring tools, to math-enabled web and mobile apps. To get started, check out how to use dynamic math content , or write your own custom component , or render on the
          server using NodeJS . To dive deeper, start with the landing page in our API documentation Browser support MathJax generates consistent, high-quality output on all major browsers & platforms. Our output formats support all
          the major browser, including: Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc. Version 3 had support for IE11, and version 2 of MathJax supported earlier versions of IE,
          back to IE6 in some output formats, so if you need to support extremely old browsers, you
          can continue to use MathJax v3.2 or MathJax v2.7 for those needs. You can find additional details in our documentation Sponsors We are supported by the MathJax Sponsorship Program and through individual donations from
        people like you. MathJax Sponsorship MathJax is a non-profit organization, registered with the IRS as a
          public charity under section 501(c)(3). Any contributions of support
          you make to MathJax, Inc., are tax deductible. EIN: 88-1669159 MathJax, Inc., is registered with the Secretary of State in West Virginia. The MathJax Sponsorship Program The MathJax project was initiated in 2009 by Design Science, the American Mathematical
          Society (AMS) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) with the goal
          of creating a robust, easy-to-use, and universal solution for displaying high-quality
          mathematics online. From the beginning, MathJax was conceived as open-source software, on
          the principle that math display should be part of the common infrastructure of the web. Providing a universal solution for online math display requires a long-term
          commitment. Our users need MathJax to be reliable and easy to use, now and in the
          future. This requires a continuous and coordinated rapid response to browser updates and
          bugs, keeping up with the proliferation of tablets, smartphones, and ebook readers, and a
          consistent approach towards new functionality and performance improvements. All of this is
          important to the community, and requires dedicated time, effort, and money. Our founding sponsors have been very generous in providing funding; however, as more and
          more individuals and organizations are using MathJax and its benefit to the community is
          growing, its base of support grew via the Sponsorship Program.  To ensure the long-term
          stability of MathJax, we continuously reach out to the community and ask organizations to
          contribute to the MathJax project by becoming a Friend , Supporter , or Partner . All MathJax sponsors share a demonstrated and significant interest in the
          dissemination of mathematics on the web, in particular through the MathJax project and its
          activities. Please feel free to contact us for any further

         under section 501(c)(3), with EIN 88-1669159.  Any contributions of support you make
         to MathJax, Inc., are tax deductible. Originally, MathJax was supported by The MathJax Consortium, a joint venture of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
         to advance mathematical and scientific content on the web.  We are grateful for the
         commitment offered by the Consortium for over 10 years, without which MathJax would
         not exist today. Core Goals The core of the MathJax project is the development of its state-of-the-art, open source,
          JavaScript platform for display of mathematics. Our key design goals are: High-quality display of mathematics notation in all browsers. Support for assistive technology, especially screen readers. No special browser setup required. Support for LaTeX, MathML, and other equation markup directly in the HTML source. An extensible, modular design with a rich API for easy integration into web and node.js applications. Support for copy and paste, SVG generation, MathML generation, and other such functionality. Interoperability with other applications and math-aware search. Support for equation conversion outside a browser (e.g., preprocessing on a server). Board of Directors Frank Tate Constinia Charbonnette Michael Gage Volker Sorge Davide Cervone MathJax Steering Committee The MathJax Steering Committee 
          meets regularly to
          advise the MathJax team on its development goals and priorities. We’re grateful for the
          support of our committee members! Robert Harington, AMS Astrid van Hoeydonck, Elsevier Ted Geis, Elsevier D Kaluza, Elsevier Andrew Heard, IEEE Matthew Posey, SIAM Suzanne Weeks, SIAM Susan Palantino, SIAM Davide Cervone, MathJax Volker Sorge, MathJax History MathJax grew out of the popular jsMath project, an earlier javascript-based math rendering system developed by Davide Cervone in
          2004. In the following years, there were many significant developments relevant for web
          publication of mathematics: consolidation of browser support for CSS 2.1, Web Font
          technology, adoption of math accessibility standards, and increasing usage of XML
          workflows for scientific publication. In 2009, the AMS, Design Science, and SIAM formed the MathJax Consortium to enable Cervone
          and others to design MathJax from the ground up as a next-generation platform, while still
          benefiting from the extensive real-world experience gained from jsMath. Since its initial
          release in 2010, MathJax has become the gold standard for mathematics on the web. In 2019, MathJax joined the NumFOCUS family of
          open-source software products as a fiscally sponsored project, and was thrilled to join
          that dynamic community. In 2022, MathJax achieved a long-standing goal by applying for and receiving its own
          501(c)3 status separate from NumFOCUS.  Now as MathJax, Inc., incorporated in West
          Virginia, USA, MathJax left NumFOCUS with many thanks for their assistance in the
          preceeding years. MathJax continues to be supported by the founding sponsors and other
          partners. Over the years since MathJax was first developed, new web technologies and paradigms
          emerged, and MathJax was not always easy to incoporate into these new approaches.  In
          2017, after nearly a decade of use, work on MathJax version 3 was begun, a complete
          rewrite of MathJax from the ground up using modern techniques.  This new version
          integrates with current toolchains and frameworks, and can run equally well in a browser
          on a server, or in a stand-alone application.  It should form a solid foundation for
          another decade of MathJax use, and its use of the Typescript language should make
          contributions from our user community easier to produce and incorporate into MathJax. The MathJax Team The MathJax team consists of Davide Cervone and Volker Sorge .  Contributors include Christian Lawson-Perfect , Omar Al-Ithawi ,
