“So easy to setup, the graphs looks clean and sleek, and super easy to dive into. The app is super easy to use, and I love having a history and being able to look back at my data/usage.”

See full review

Very easy to set up and configure, lots of metrics that are very accessible, super useful for a small team of researchers using a few large workstations for data analysis and machine learning. We mainly use it to help with load balancing and optimising code (memory and I/O as things scale)
