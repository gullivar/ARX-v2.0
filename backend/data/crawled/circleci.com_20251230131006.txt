“Switching to CircleCI has allowed our engineers to build and release mobile and web projects with far greater simplicity, speed and performance.”

Seiichi Sato | Lead Engineer at Bandai Namco Studios

“We’ve reduced the time needed to manage CI/CD infrastructure, while we deliver new projects with high confidence.”
