WHAT MAKES AUVIK DIFFERENT?

Why there’s no easier way to manage your network
Real-time monitoring means no delays or surprises

No more waiting for scans to finish. No more stale data. Just live metrics that show you what’s happening right now.

Automated mapping keeps your topology up to date

Never build another map from scratch. Auvik updates your map in real time as your network changes — so you always know what you’re working with.

Cloud-based deployment takes minutes, not days

Get full visibility in under an hour for most networks. Alerts and multi-vendor device support work out of the box.

Built for entry-level techs & senior engineers alike

Simple enough for junior techs to get up to speed quickly. Powerful enough for senior engineers to dig deep.

All the management features you need in one place

No more jumping between tools for mapping, traffic analysis, config management, and inventory.

Supports 700+ device vendors out of the box

Monitor your switches, firewalls, routers, and controllers right away — no custom configs or device templates to set up.

“I rate Auvik 10 out of 10 for ease of monitoring and management. The interface is highly intuitive. I’ve seen a few other network mapping tools, and they never seem to work out well. It’s miles ahead of its competitors.”
