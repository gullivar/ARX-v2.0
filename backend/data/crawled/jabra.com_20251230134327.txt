CUSTOMER STORIES
Don’t just take our word for it
See why so many companies are choosing Jabra for their video and audio solutions.
Jabra was able to deploy a number of different devices across workspace...
from personal headsets, speakerphone to conferencing devices. These interfaces effortlessly with our communication tools, and offer a zero set-up, secure solution that gives us the confidence to conduct our business from anywhere just like we would in person.
Brian Chan
Information Technology Director, Jebsen Group
We realized that we need to provide our staff with professional quality equipment...
to allow them to work better. With the Evolve2 headsets, it's easier to focus during long calls and the PanaCast 20 provides sharp and clear images which is especially important if we are invited to speak at webinars or host important client meetings.
Karl Mak
Co-Founder and CEO, HEPMIL Media Group, SGAG Media
Jabra is one of our top-tier equipment providers...
and their technology have been enabling our members to connect with the world seamlessly.
Cherrie Lau
Regional Head APAC - Meetings & Events, The Executive Centre
