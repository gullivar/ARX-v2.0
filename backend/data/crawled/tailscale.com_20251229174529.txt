Setting up a mesh VPN on all my devices was so damn easy thanks to @Tailscale. A tightly sealed network of remote devices with almost no configuration and also ease of adding a new device to the mesh is just what I wanted. Amazing work @Tailscale!

Uhh this is sweet! Redirecting SSL authentication to Tailscale to handle it for you eliminates the need to manage PKI at scale, or go through the nightmare of changing keys out when someone leaves. And, EVERYTHING is protected, regardless of where the workload lives. AWESOME!

After installing @Tailscale on a bunch of machines on my home network (Linux x86 + aarch64, MacOS, Windows) I've just ventured out. Had to restart the process but holy moly, just SSH'ed into my boxes, building code and pushing configs around like I'm home. Amazing. Converted

Just paid for @Tailscale. Installed it on our robots; so far so good. Compared to OpenVPN: * Serverless * Always on * Same config in office & field * Scales to large # devices * GUI-based ACL w/SSO * Fixed IPs, DNS-friendly * Dead simple config+use

The beauty of @Tailscale is that they enable people to make their own personal internet, for free in most cases. It’s this weird paradigm shift, since you have to actively work to make applications insecure rather than the other way around.

If you deal with servers in any way drop everything and get this. VPN nirvana. @Tailscale https://tailscale.com

@Tailscale busts double nat (travel router -> plane wifi) and connects me to my home server so I can silence a prometheus humidity alert (can’t really add water to the humidifier from here).

Sometimes you come across a tool that changes how you see things, @Tailscale is one of those. Thinking in terms of point 2 point VPN tunnels seems so outdated once you have seen that lights.

Been using @Tailscale for a while at work and personally. Who would have thought networking could be... easy?!

The campus WiFi also prevented my original Wireguard VPN. Multiple NATs, blocked ports... Tailscale just figures it all out. There's honestly dozens of other reasons, but for me it just helps me to be portable. I run pihole too. I'd be lost without it now!

Oh @Tailscale, I’ve put you off for so long not knowing what I was missing. In advance of #KubeCon I now can manage my home NAS and my home k8s cluster…from my phone! Thank you!

Thanks to @Tailscale being available as a package for @Synology I was able to renew @letsencrypt certificate on my home NAS while being 8000 kilometers away from it. Amazing piece of tech 🥹
