Any discussion pertaining to such revisions must be done in this board. Before posting, make sure that your arguments are presented in a manner that is easy to understand and backed by valid scans. In addition, you need to make sure that everything is in English or translated by a reliable source, and it is advised that you use this forum's sandbox feature to prepare your content revision threads in advance. Also, please always include the name of the verses that you want to revise in your thread titles, and use the exact same tag/category titles that the verses and relevant characters have in their corresponding VS Battles wiki pages.

Topics regarding deaths of prominent actors or authors, major recent entertainment media releases, or similar should usually be posted in our General Discussion subforum, as they do not directly concern the running of our wiki in itself. Threads to celebrate major global festivities are acceptable when posted by our bureaucrats or administrators, but the ones for Christmas or New Year's Eve should preferably only be handled by bureaucrats. Any threads created to incite drama or cause other damage to this community should quickly be deleted or closed by our staff.
