I tried learning to code before, using Codecademy and Coursera. I struggled because I had no background in coding, and I was spending a lot of time Googling. Dataquest helped me actually learn.” Jessica Ko Machine Learning Engineer at Twitter “I liked the interactive environment on Dataquest. The material was clear and well organized. I spent more time practicing then watching videos and it made me want to keep learning.” Victoria E. Guzik Associate Data Scientist at Callisto Media “I really love learning on Dataquest. I looked into a couple of other options and I found that they were much too handhold-y and fill in the blank relative to Dataquest’s method. The projects on Dataquest were key to getting my job. I doubled my income!” Join 1M+ data learners on Dataquest. 1 Create a free account 2 Choose a learning path 3 Complete exercises and projects 4 Advance your career Start learning today Sign Up For Dataquest All rights reserved.
