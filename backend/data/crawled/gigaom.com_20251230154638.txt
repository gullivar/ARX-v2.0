Helping Practitioners and Vendors Get Ahead of the Market
“

I am a big fan of your service. Radar reports probably save a good week’s worth of research into the players in the market, and who we actually need to care about. It definitely delivers additional value because I’m getting that wider field view than just the vendors we know. We end up making better decisions for something that’s more feature rich. Realistically, it probably adds an additional 20-30% value to our research process. GigaOm Radar reports are super cost effective for the areas I need information on. ”
