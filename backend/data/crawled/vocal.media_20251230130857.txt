Christmas is Not Always “Beer and Skittles”

If you find the holiday season challenging, you’re not alone. I have never been a big fan of Christmas. I have always found it a bit pretentious. It is a time for kids, really. I have not had kids in my life, so the "children's influence" around this time of year doesn’t occur.

Evac

“Your attention please. May we have your attention, please. We are currently under mandatory evacuation. Please gather all your belongings and make sure that your children are with you. The last bus to the mainland will be leaving in five minutes. If you are not on the bus at that time, there will be no further transportation out. Anybody still on the island will be required to leave on foot. It is highly recommended that you leave now. The approaching storm will not be survivable.”

Caretakers: Part 1

-------- Author's Note ------- Before going any further, I would like to give a quick heads up. I'm trying something a little different with this story. In the past I've lost momentum writing longer pieces. But, this is a story I've had brewing since 2018 and I think in order to get it out there, I'm going to release it in chunks. I'm not sure how many we'll end up with but what you're about to read is a mystery/thriller set in the same town as a previous story I wrote, "Blue Heron Creek". Thank you for giving this a read and... be careful when you check into Mercy Regional Hospital... The morgue doesn't have the only thing rotten...

Word of the Day: ホチキス

I don't know the word for Staples. I remember I used to think that Hochikisu was an Onomatopoeia for a stapler rather than a brand name. I am pretty sure I already have this title as a theme, which is making me feel many sort of ways as Vocal is harassing me about payments currently.

FPS: Villanelle of Regret Challenge Winners

Some feelings don’t fade. They repeat. The Villanelle of Regret challenged poets to write into that return. To let regret, longing, and obsession build with each pass, rather than resolve. The strongest entries trusted repetition to carry the weight.

The Forgotten Room Challenge Winners

Some doors stay shut because crossing the threshold changes something. In The Forgotten Room, writers stepped into spaces thick with dust, memory, and silence. What they found there wasn’t always safe or clear, but it was honest, layered, and unforgettable. Here, setting isn’t background noise; it’s the heart of the story, carrying the weight of what’s been hidden or avoided.
