How research at UC Berkeley is driving data-driven solutions

As rapidly evolving technology is transforming our daily lives, the U.S. is gaining speed in how to best leverage AI and machine learning to analyze a wealth of data, empowering people to make better decisions that shape the future of cities. The Fellowship for Future Analytics Leaders Program, a partnership between KONE and the UC Berkeley Master of Analytics program, invites college students to build mobile applications that analyze vast amounts of data on elevators, helping salespeople and customers make more informed decisions about installing and maintaining these machines that enable the flow of urban life.

Keeping millions moving in the heart of Makkah Saudi Arabia

Every year, millions of people pass through the Makkah Clock Tower area in Saudi Arabia. This complex with seven towering skyscraper hotels was built to modernize one of the busiest cities on earth. Completed in 2011, the central Royal Clock Tower is the fourth-tallest building and sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the world. What does it take to ensure smooth and safe people flow in a building as grand as this?

A smooth and future-proof elevator ride starts with smart upgrades

You’ve decided it’s time to modernize your elevator. But what’s the next step? How can you upgrade this critical part of your building smartly and cost-effectively, while minimizing disruptions to tenants and visitors? This article guides you through modernization in clear steps, showing how targeted upgrades make an elevator safer, more energy-efficient, and future-ready – with maximum value.

Working together with our suppliers to thrive sustainably

KONE upholds high sustainability standards across its global supply chain. In India, we are partnering with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, UNIDO to work alongside our local suppliers in advancing inclusivity and improving circular and sustainable practices. By lifting standards together, we help our suppliers meet these high expectations while turning sustainability into opportunity.

A life devoted to building communities

KONE’s community-builder John Simon worked for the company for over 25 years and stayed actively involved even after retirement. Whether in his role as a communications officer, as the long-time leader of the KONE Global Youth Camp, or as a youth worker and basketball coach, he dedicated his life to bringing people together.

The people and tech keeping the Gold Coast running

The Gold Coast is famous for being home to some of Australia’s tallest buildings. As the city continues to grow, KONE’s Deb Wentworth, Karnie Garcia, and their teams of maintenance technicians are leveraging AI-powered technologies and close teamwork to make the Gold Coast lifestyle possible.

Designing for tomorrow’s green cities

Green buildings are a crucial lever for cities to cut emissions and design healthier, more sustainable urban spaces that also make business sense. In Vietnam, locally adapted green building standards help tackle environmental challenges and allow buildings to better respond to the needs of everyone who calls the city home.

We are building a future together with our partners

Michelle Wen is steering KONE’s purchasing to support the business and ensure operational excellence. In this new role as Executive Vice President of Purchasing and a member of KONE’s executive board, she prioritizes Compliance, Quality, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)* Performance, Innovation, and Sustainability in every decision, ensuring KONE and its partners succeed together.

Turning ideas into reality

Innovation work is like climbing up a mountain that no-one has climbed before. You know where you want to go, but you need to find your own path to get there, and you can only succeed as a team. For people in the KONE innovation team, every day can be like a small expedition.

Let’s talk about it: making mental health welcome at work

In the construction industry, talking about mental health is not commonplace. Whether on building sites or behind desks, many employees struggle alone, unsure if it’s safe to share their worries. But when someone does, it can change everything. At KONE, teams are creating a culture where it is safe – and even encouraged – to speak up.

Zebrabox self-storage, Winterthur, Switzerland

A leading Swiss self-storage company, Zebrabox caters to more than 6000 customers across all its locations. Its facility in Winterthur is its latest and most advanced and uses a service robot to help customers navigate the building when storing or withdrawing items from storage. KONE’s digitally connected elevators allow the robot to autonomously call elevators and travel across the building.

ALICE@Mediapolis, Singapore

ALICE@Mediapolis is Singapore’s first privately developed, green and smart multi-tenant business park and office space. Located in the island nation’s “Silicon Valley” and buzzing with creatives and start-ups, ALICE@Mediapolis is a place where smart people flow, green choices and great minds come together.

Finland at Dubai Expo 2020, UAE

With an estimated 25 million visitors over the 6 months the Expo 2020 Dubai is open, the event brings the world together. At the Expo, a striking tent-meets-snow motif forms the basis for the structure that is the Finland Pavilion. The theme for Finland is ‘Sharing future happiness’ – a task that it will accomplish by showcasing the best and brightest in Finnish expertise, innovations, and solutions. KONE is helping provide smooth people flow and multisensory experiences to visitors to the pavilion. The company has a lot to offer when it comes to technology and know-how on enabling smart and sustainable urbanization with an emphasis on well-being and happiness.

ROYAL LANDMARK

The Makkah Clock Royal Tower Hotel can only be described in superlatives: the tallest hotel, the largest indoor space (1.6 million square meters for the total project), and on the list of tallest buildings, it currently holds second place.

Nausicaá, Boulogne-sur-Mer, France

Nausicaá is Europe’s largest aquarium and a unique center of scientific discovery. For visitors, it’s a mesmerizing journey into the underwater home of more than 1,600 marine species. Dive through a massive wave as an escalator takes you to the depths of the sea and then rise to the surface in a submarine-like capsule elevator.

History comes to life

Replacing four sets of escalators in a century-old facility that sees over a million visitors a year is no easy task. Yet, KONE managed to do this at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, with no disruption to the flow of visitors.

WOWING Amsterdam

Amsterdam is renowned for its artistic heritage, and is now reinventing itself by transforming older buildings into iconic structures. A’DAM illustrates the city’s fine balance of fusion and technology.

Creating the home of the future now

Smart home technology, ease of use and comfort are key when it comes to luxury living in the heart of London’s Soho. In this historic center of culture, trade and diplomacy, new technology is adding fundamental benefits and giving a taste of the future to the residents of 37 Golden Square today.
