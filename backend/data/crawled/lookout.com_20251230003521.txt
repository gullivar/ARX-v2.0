The SOC’s Biggest Blind Spot and the Risk it Poses

Learn how to make mobile telemetry a critical part of enterprise security by integrating with SIEM, SOAR, or XDR.
An 'AI-first approach' to cybersecurity places artificial intelligence at the foundation of threat detection, analysis, and response—rather than layering it on as an afterthought.

It uses real-time insights into behavior, tone, and activity to flag threats, automate triage, and adapt—delivering faster, smarter, and more scalable defense in an ever-evolving threat landscape.
