It Took 6+ Years For Linux's "New" Mount API To Be Properly Documented In Man Pages
4 Hours Ago - Linux Storage - New Mount API - 2 Comments

In demonstrating one of the gaps of man pages in modern times and likely having hindered the adoption of the Linux kernel's new mount API, it took more than six years for those system calls to be properly documented within man pages. The Linux "new" mount API was introduced back in mid-2019 with Linux 5.2 and since supported by key file-systems after several years but not until weeks ago was this file descriptor based mount API scoped out within man pages.

The Performance Of Arch Linux Powered CachyOS On AMD EPYC Servers
29 December 10:10 AM EST - Operating Systems - 26 Comments

One of the more interesting announcements over the holiday period thus far is that moving into 2026, CachyOS is looking to develop a server edition for their Arch Linux based operating system. CachyOS has garnered quite a following among Linux enthusiasts and gamers for its competitive out-of-the-box performance, employing some of the optimizations by Intel's now defunct Clear Linux distribution, and pulling in all of the goodness from upstream Arch Linux. It will be very interesting to see how CachyOS Server Edition takes shape and whether it will develop a foothold in any prominent enterprise environments. While CachyOS Server Edition isn't yet released and still in its early stages, over the holidays I decided to see how CachyOS in its current form currently looks for AMD EPYC servers.

NTFSPLUS Linux Driver Renamed To Just "NTFS" With Latest Code Restructuring
29 December 09:33 AM EST - Linux Storage - NTFS v3 Patches - 11 Comments

One of the unexpected Linux kernel surprises of 2025 was NTFSPLUS being announced as a new driver for Microsoft's NTFS file-system with better performance and more features compared to the classic read-only NTFS driver or the "NTFS3" kernel driver that Paragon Software submitted upstream. That NTFSPLUS driver has continued expanding its feature set and robustness and sent out today was the third iteration of the patches. Now this driver is simply being called "NTFS" with no longer going by the NTFSPLUS name.

Intel Xe vs. i915 Driver Performance On Linux 6.19 For Arc Alchemist GPUs
28 December 11:10 AM EST - Display Drivers - 17 Comments

Similar to AMD GCN 1.0/1.1 GPUs where there was product overlap between the Radeon and AMDGPU kernel drivers (and now using AMDGPU by default for those aging Radeon GPUs with Linux 6.19), the Intel Arc A-Series "Alchenist" graphics cards are in a similar boat. By default the Alchemist and Meteor Lake graphics use the i915 kernel driver by default but they can optionally use the Xe kernel driver instead as what is Intel's modern open-source kernel graphics driver. As part of our various year end 2025 benchmarks, today is a look at the current i915 vs. Xe driver performance for the Intel Arc Graphics A580.

As part of the various end-of-year benchmarking comparisons on Phoronix and with Linux 6.19 switching older AMD GCN 1.0/1.1 graphics cards to the AMDGPU driver by default, I planned for a very large AMD Radeon graphics card comparison on the latest open-source Linux driver for ending out 2025.
