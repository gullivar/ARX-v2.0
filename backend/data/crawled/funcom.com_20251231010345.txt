WANT TO MAKE GAMES
AND HAVE A DAMN GOOD TIME DOING IT?

 AVAILABLE POSITIONS
WE ARE SURVIVORS

We’ve been making games for 30 years. We’ve had our ups and downs. We’ve celebrated success and we’ve endured failure. We’ve been on the battlefield and we’ve earned our battle-scars.

WE ARE FIGHTERS

We’ve been called many things, but boring isn’t one of them. We punch above our weight, we fight for our creative vision and we charge into game development with the determination to create games with unique personality and soul.

WE ARE FUNCOM

Our goal is simple: make great games and have a damn good time doing it. Funcom is a great place to work and play, and together we make games our fans and our team want to play.
