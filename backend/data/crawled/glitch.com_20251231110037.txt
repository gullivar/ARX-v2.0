Project hosting ended on July 8, 2025. For more details, head to the blog.
Au revoir, Glitch!

If you haven’t heard by now, on July 8th we ended project hosting. That sounds like goodbye, but it’s not exactly.

You can login to download your projects or set a redirect until December 31, 2025 and those redirects will be supported until the end of 2026.

After that, we’re not sure what’s next but thank you so much for joining us when you did. Glitch wouldn’t be the same without your fun, thoughtful, strange, helpful, beautiful, weird projects. Until we meet again!
