#indianastateuniversity #sycamoregrad #classof2025 @indianastateuniversity It is with a heavy heart that we share the passing of Charles E. “Charlie” Brown.

Charles E. “Charlie” Brown was a significant figure at Indiana State University, serving as the director of the university’s Charles E. Brown Cultural Center for more than 30 years, which was renamed in his honor in 2012. Mr. Brown was instrumental in creating a supportive environment for students of all cultures, addressing their unique needs, and promoting awareness on campus.

“Indiana State University mourns the passing of Charles ‘Charlie’ Brown, a steadfast leader whose decades of service shaped the heart of our campus community,” said Indiana State University President Mike Godard. “Charlie’s dedication to the university’s Cultural Center created a home where generations of students felt seen, supported, and inspired. His legacy of compassion, advocacy, and mentorship will continue to influence Indiana State for years to come. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all who were impacted by his remarkable life and work.”

Services for Charles E. “Charlie” Brown will take place on Saturday, December 20, 2025, at St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, 1000 S. 15th Street in Terre Haute. Visitation will be from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., with the memorial service beginning immediately after at 12 p.m. @indianastateuniversity Almost there, Sycamores! Commencement is just days away...get ready to celebrate the moment you’ve been working toward these past few years! 🥹
