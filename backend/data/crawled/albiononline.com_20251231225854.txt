”Albion Online is bursting at the seams with features, each seamlessly integrated, providing a true sandbox world.“

”Albion Online is worth looking at because it aims to deconstruct the overwrought cut-and-paste template that too many MMOs build from.“

”If you’ve been looking for a new game to challenge you and bring back that nostalgic sandbox feel then you really need look no further than Albion Online.“

Feature	1	
FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
PVP ACTION

Feature	2	
PLAYER-DRIVEN ECONOMY
FARMING

Need a break from fighting for your life, but still want to support your guild? Retire to your own private island off the coast of Albion and build and maintain a farm, including crops and animals, with a whole new set of buildings. Generate food to fuel your guild’s war efforts, or even just sell on the market for a profit!

PLAYER-DRIVEN ECONOMY
DISCOVER, GATHER, HUNT

To erect the greatest cities and smith the most deadly weapons requires resources, and plenty of them. Search far and wide to find the very rarest, most prized materials. But be on your guard - your enemies will be looking too!

PLAYER-DRIVEN ECONOMY
CRAFT YOUR OWN ARMOR AND WEAPONS

A player forges their own destiny! Be it a mighty set of armor, a magic staff or a set of sturdy tools - all items are crafted by you in our player-driven economy, so take up position at the anvil and get smithing!

PLAYER-DRIVEN ECONOMY
HAUL YOUR GOODS AROUND THE WORLD

There are many ways to transport goods across the vast world of Albion. So load up your trusty pack mule and set off on your way! Be warned, though, a full carriage is slow, and an easy target for thieves - be prepared to protect your cargo!

PLAYER-DRIVEN ECONOMY
TRADE YOUR GOODS AT LOCAL MARKETPLACES

Have more resources and items than you know what to do with? Or are you looking for a particular kind of blade? Take yourself to the nearest marketplace – plenty of traders await you there, and you’re sure to find what you’re looking for!

    
Feature	3	
REAL ESTATE
PLAYER HOUSING

Build a house, then set it up in style! Comfy beds, tables laden with food, hunting trophies, chests to store your valuables... Grow your collection of furniture and decorations to make your house a home.

REAL ESTATE
YOUR OWN CORNER OF ALBION

Claim your own corner of the world, then choose from over 20 buildings to develop your patch of land into a functioning city! Whether military, industrial or residential; plan carefully to use the valuable building land effectively and expand your empire.

 
Feature	4	
CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION
DESTINY BOARD

To create your perfect character, you need to be shown the many paths your destiny could take you. That’s where the Destiny Board comes in! The Destiny Board shows you everything you are and everything you could be, and that’s a lot! Dive in and choose your path.

CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION
NO CLASSES - NO RESTRICTIONS

Forget what you know from other MMOs. There are no classes in Albion Online, which means no restrictions on what you can equip. Experiment to design and create your own perfect build - in Albion Online, you are what you wear!

 
Feature	5	
A DANGEROUS WORLD
DEMONS OF HELL

From hideous, fiery nightmares comes an entirely new threat to the world of Albion: The Demons of Hell. For now, their presence is felt only dimly as they try to force their way through gates between this world and theirs, but their will to crossover is unwavering.

A DANGEROUS WORLD
THE HERETICS

The Heretics were corrupted heavily by the magical fallout from the Great War, and are now barely recognizable as their former selves. Crazed, they roam the world of Albion with no purpose but indiscriminate murder. Show them no mercy!

A DANGEROUS WORLD
KEEPERS OF ALBION

Deep in the forests dwell Albion's oldest denizens, its Keepers. The native inhabitants of Albion channel its dangerous magical power from the nature around them, and are remnants of a forgotten era of peace. They will fight fiercely for their home!

A DANGEROUS WORLD
THE UNDEAD

The fallen of Albion rarely stay dead for long… Skeletal forms of restless spirits roam in the dark, cavernous recesses of the crypts and dungeons under the earth, preying on unwitting adventurers. These husks know no mercy, and should be shown none!

A DANGEROUS WORLD
DISCIPLES OF MORGANA

Once an immensely powerful sorceress, Morgana diminished after a cataclysmic battle with Merlin at the end of the Great War. However, her devoted Disciples walk the earth still, bearing her standard in the name of evil, devastation... and revenge.

A DANGEROUS WORLD
THE AVALONIANS

The Avalonians are a proud and ancient faction, formed after the dragons went to their long slumber. They learned the power of the land through trial and error, infusing their tools, beasts, and even themselves with magic.

A DANGEROUS WORLD
ROYAL EXPEDITIONARY FORCES

Sent from the Old World to the coasts of Albion to exploit its resources, the Royals now serve as a place of refuge for newcomers in Albion. Not out of charity, of course, but to fill the King’s coffers in the Old World.

      
TRULY CROSS-PLATFORM

Albion Online is the first truly cross-platform MMO experience, available for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. You choose how your adventure evolves, at home or on the go!
