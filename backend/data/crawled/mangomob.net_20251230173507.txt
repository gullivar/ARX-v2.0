MAYO
THE PRODUCT

MAYO is the next step in mobile ad revenue optimization. With MAYO, publishers no longer rely on manual optimization settings to improve ad revenue performance. Mangomob’s 100% algorithm-based, server-side optimization solution processes billions of bid requests daily and optimizes all relevant performance parameters automatically in real time.

 

HOW IT WORKS

MAYO is a learning optimization machine, the result of years of research and experience in mobile ad monetization. As the Mangomob servers process billions of ad impressions, the MAYO algorithm measures key parameters continually, analyzing fill rates and CPMs on high granularity. At the same time, it takes into account each app, format, country, device, RTB exchange and ad network and a range of other factors. All relevant parameters are then optimized in real time on all applicable RTB exchanges and ad networks.
