Learn More Why GigaOm? See Our Case Studies Helping Practitioners and Vendors Get Ahead of the Market “ I am a big fan of your service. Radar reports probably save a good week’s worth of research into the players in the market, and who we actually need to care about. It definitely delivers additional value because I’m getting that wider field view than just the vendors we know. We end up making better decisions for something that’s more feature rich. Realistically, it probably adds an additional 20-30% value to our research process. GigaOm Radar reports are super cost effective for the areas I need information on. ” Patrick McMorran, FCP Euro VP of Technology Strategy & Operations “ Ron Williams is an exceptional analyst who brings the perspective of being in this industry for over 5 decades, and GigaOm follows a thorough methodology which gives us confidence to both use their insights to guide our strategy and share with our communities to inform their decisions. ” Ishan Mukherjee, New Relic SVP of Marketing “ GigaOm brings clarity to this crowded and hype-laden market. ” Jon Bratseth, CEO and Founder, Vespa “ I depend on my GigaOm research subscription to help me navigate the technology vendor landscape and keep me ahead of industry trends.” ” Atul Deshpande, Principal Solutions Architect, RedHat “ The GigaOM CXO Decision Brief serves as a great enablement resource for our prospects and internal team on the business value of our solution. It was a pleasure working with the GigaOM team for this project and we’ve already received very positive end user feedback on the brief. ” Lightlytics “ Leader in emerging cloud and data technologies. I like the radar and key criteria reports you have produced. Lots of information presented in a ‘easy to consume’ format ” Large Energy Company “ GigaOm’s Radar is distinctive – it’s looking at the product attributes rather than the market share of a company. Market share is a ‘rear view’ metric – and isn’t very useful given the pace of technological change. ” Minio “ Digital native with top experts on new technologies like Object storage, Kubernetes, AIOps. ” Hitachi “ The GigaOm reports have a palpable, solid bedrock that is based on tech and delivered by people that know what they’re talking about. They give me insights about the current state of the market and where each vendor/product is trending towards. ” Large Insurance Company Media Partners Leading Enterprise customers worldwide rely on GigaOm.
