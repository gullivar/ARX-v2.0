Built on open standards, API hub is a universal catalog that allows developers to access APIs and govern them to a consistent quality. Using autogenerated recommendations provided by Gemini, you can create assets like API proxies, integrations, or even plugin extensions that can be deployed to Vertex AI or ChatGPT. Organize your API information in API hub Automated API Security with ML based abuse detection Advanced API Security detects undocumented and unmanaged APIs linked to Google Cloud L7 Load Balancers. Advanced API Security also regularly assesses managed APIs, surfaces API proxies that do not meet security standards, and provides recommended actions when issues are detected. ML-powered dashboards accurately identify critical API abuses by finding patterns within the large number of bot alerts, reducing the time to act on important incidents. Get started with Advanced API Security Automated API Security with ML based abuse detection High-performance API proxies Orchestrate and manage traffic for demanding applications with unparalleled control and reliability. Apigee supports styles like REST , gRPC , SOAP , and GraphQL , providing flexibility to implement any architecture.

APIs enable seamless communication between applications, servers, and users in today's tech-driven world. As their numbers grow, API management has become crucial, encompassing design, development, testing, deployment, governance, security, monitoring, and monetization within the software development life cycle. What is a RESTful API? RESTful APIs adhere to REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture constraints. Following these architecture constraints enables APIs to offer scalability, speed, and data versatility. An API of this kind accesses data by using HTTP requests and is the most common type of API used in modern applications today. What makes Apigee different from other API management solutions? Apigee is Google Cloud’s fully managed API management solution. Trusted by enterprises across the globe, Apigee is developer-friendly and provides comprehensive capabilities to support diverse API architectural styles, deployment environments, and use cases. Apigee also provides flexible pricing options for every business to get started and become successful on the platform. Which API protocols does Apigee support? Apigee currently supports REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, or OpenAPI protocols. Why should you secure your APIs? Companies worldwide rely on application programming interfaces, or APIs, to facilitate digital experiences and unleash the potential energy of their own data and processes. But the proliferation and importance of APIs comes with a risk. As a gateway to a wealth of information and systems, APIs have become a favorite target for hackers. Due to the prevalence of such attacks, there is a need for a proactive approach to secure APIs. What makes an API secure? Apigee helps organizations stay ahead of security threats by offering protection in three layers: 1. Robust policies that protect every API transaction from unauthorized users. 2. Advanced API security provides automated controls to identify API misconfigurations, malicious bot attacks, and anomalous traffic patterns without overhead and alert fatigue. Web application and API security based on the same technology used by Google to protect its public-facing services against web application vulnerabilities, DDoS attacks, fraudulent bot activity, and API-targeted threats. Google Cloud WAAP combines three solutions (Apigee, Cloud Armor , and reCAPTCHA Enterprise ) to provide comprehensive protection against threats and fraud.
