Start a GoFundMe YouCaring was founded in 2011 by Brock Ketcher, Naomi Ketcher and Luke Miner after they returned from two years of international mission trips. Inspired by their time abroad, the three friends resolved to continue helping others. This resolution became YouCaring, the crowdfunding platform initially designed to help fellow students fundraise for tuition and other costs. Word of the site spread fast, and within months thousands of people were raising money for medical, charitable, and personal causes. Since then, we’ve grown to become the leader in online fundraising, having raised more than $1 billion in support of individuals, families, communities, and nonprofits looking to save lives, remember loved ones, recover from disasters, and fund humanitarian efforts.
