Here's hoping VPNs aren't blocked and RAM prices improve in 2026!

[image] December 31, 2025 Tan3l6 I just found out that with some latest patch the "system properties" options link has been removed from Windows 11 "System>About" page. But why?
Took some time to search for correct thing in search. The thing works now only from search bar?
Have to search "view advanced system settings" (or SystemPropertiesAdvanced) in search to access it now. Or a tad shorter search, still not convenient.
Also can make a shortcut, but still. December 31, 2025 AbydosOne [image]
