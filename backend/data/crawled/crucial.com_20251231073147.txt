Important announcement
To the Crucial Community –

Micron has made the difficult decision to wind down the Crucial consumer business. Micron will ship Crucial consumer products through February 2026, with warranty and support continuing. Micron Crucial consumer products may continue to be available for purchase from distributors and resellers for some time.

For nearly three decades, Crucial has been more than a brand—it’s been a trusted companion for millions who build, upgrade, and create. With our deepest gratitude to passionate customers, dedicated partners, and the talented Micron team, Crucial became synonymous with innovation, quality, and reliability.

Thank you for 29 incredible years of trust, collaboration, and shared success. Crucial wouldn’t have been what it was without you.
