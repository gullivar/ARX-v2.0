I have to say JobBoard.io rocks! Stuart Birch Managing Director at Education Personnel I switched to JobBoard.io after running a self-hosted WordPress job board for over four years. WordPress was a mess. The user experience was terrible, the code was a tangle of poorly architected dependencies and the payment system was unreliable and labor intensive. JobBoard.io has taken away all of those problems. I'm never looking back.
