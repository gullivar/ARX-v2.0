Why Video.js?

Video.js is the open-source HTML5 video player for the modern web: embed html5 video easily, support all major formats, and style it your way.

It supports video playback on desktop and mobile devices. The project was started mid 2010, and now has hundreds of contributors and has been used on over 3,000,000 websites.

Plays anything

Plays “traditional” file formats such as MP4 and WebM, but also supports adaptive streaming formats such as HLS and DASH. There’s even a special UI for live streams!

Easy to style

Video.js is designed to be a reliable and consistent base to build on top of. The player looks great out of the box, but can be easily styled with a little bit of extra CSS.

100s of plugins

When you need to add additional functionality, a well-documented plugin architecture has your back. The community has already built hundreds of skins and plugins that you can install, such as Chromecast, IMA, even VR.

Supported everywhere

Your video should work everywhere your app does. The team makes an effort to support every modern browser we can, including desktop and mobile.

USED BY
