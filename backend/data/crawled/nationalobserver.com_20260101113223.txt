How National Observer made a difference in 2025
Jimmy Thomson
We reached more than four million readers, nearly 10 per cent of the Canadian population. More than 1,500 CNO readers attended a live event. One poll found 30 per cent of people who got their 2025 election news online depended on us. And, let me tell you about the things we know happened as a result of our work. Cochrane, Alta. remained in a climate action program despite heavy pressure to leave it, after seeing our reporting on the network that had targeted it. That same group said it would have to operate “under the radar” because of our reporting. Peterborough County passed a motion to make sure all elected officials in the region saw that reporting. A massive wave of political engagement hit Vancouver City Council after we reported on the city’s plans to cut its climate and sustainability department. John Woodside’s stories on new money for the Trans Mountain pipeline were raised in the House of Commons, with opposition parties calling for full transparency. Read on. There's more to this great story of impact and relevance.
