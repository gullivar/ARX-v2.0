H200 also uses up to 141GB of HBM3e, but memory a bottleneck. This is going to cost @teortaxestex : > 700K H200s in inventory Huh? That's at least $15B worth of chips. I thought demand far exceeds supply and Chyna would cut into the vital capacity that Free Countries compete over (thus, Jensen is just a CCP spy)? Was the vendor financing trickery running out of steam? [image] Jukan / @jukan05 : Reuters: Nvidia placed an urgent order with TSMC as demand for the H200 in China surges.

That's massive. Andrew Curran / @andrewcurran_ : ByteDance plans to spend $14 billion on NVIDIA H200's next year to keep up with demand.

Voter registration records show he's been registered to vote in Florida since March 2024. The announcement comes a day before a Jan 1 residency cut-off for a proposed billionaire tax in CA: https://www.bloomberg.com/... Tommy / @shaughnessy119 : Miami will be the finance and tech capital of America NYC/SF -> Miami talent flow will accelerate SF's wealth tax (its spending not revenue problem) and NYC's socialism will accelerate the flow. @cernovich : Did anyone think people would stay and let themselves be fleeced? Julian Klymochko / @julianklymochko : As expected, the great billionaire migration out of California, due to a proposed highly-controversial and authoritarian wealth tax, has begun.  Where Thiel goes, many will follow.  Ironically, the likely net effect is a dramatic reduction in income tax receipts, as the state's wealthiest flee to lower tax jurisdictions.  “Will it work this time?  No, it never does.  I mean, these people somehow delude themselves into thinking it might, but ...

Siegler / Spyglass : Meta just bought into the enterprise market with its Manus deal, which may eventually help it expand into cloud offerings like those of its Big Tech peers Tanmay Puri / International Business Times : Meta Buys AI Company Manus Worth $500 Million — Here's Why X: Chris McGuire / @chrisrmcguire : Great write-up in the @WSJ of @Meta 's acquisition of @ManusAI .  Meta confirmed to the WSJ that not only will Manus have no Chinese ownership interests, but Manus will also discontinue all services and operations in China.  That's a great outcome for the US, and a bad one for China.  As I noted in the article, this deal is evidence that strong export and investment restrictions on China can actually incentivize Chinese AI companies to defect to the U.S. AI ecosystem - which is a double-win for the United States.  But that only works if those controls are tight and comprehensive.  If we loosen controls, we're less likely to see Chinese AI startups defect again in the future... Kyle Chan / @kyleichan : The Meta-Manus deal is the latest example of what I call “the Great Reversal” where technology no longer just flows from the West to China but now also from China to the West. Will do a High Capacity piece on this and what it means later. Peter Harrell / @petereharrell : When I worked on developing the outbound investment control regime that the government set up several years ago, Meta's acquisition of Manus is precisely one of the types of impacts we were hoping for. 1.  Top Chinese AI talent decides to decamp from China in order to get access to western capital, avoid potential export controls, and keep access to western markets.  2. Shareholders (especially western ones) in early stage AI firms still get rewarded for their investments. Henry Gao / @henrysgao : META has just landed a devastating blow to China's AI strategy by taking over Manus. The message is unmistakable: only Chinese firms willing to uproot themselves entirely and leave China behind can access real capital, talent, and global scale. The exodus is coming. Jeff Horwitz / Reuters : Internal docs reveal Meta's tactics to fend off pressure to crack down on scammers, including efforts to make scam ads “not findable” for regulators and others —  As regulators press Meta to crack down on rogue advertisers on Facebook and Instagram, the social media giant has drafted a “playbook” to stall them.

This would go for harm as well.” Roman A. / @romanad : For social media companies, the fight against tech regulation has nothing to do with free speech but everything to do with continuing to generate profit from the scam industry, which is stealing money from their users, without oversight or accountability.  —  www.reuters.com/investigatio...

This is major!  According to @jeffhorwitz.bsky.social, Meta had a policy in place to prevent scam ads from being detected by regulators.  It's reminiscent of the “diesel dupe” scandal from a decade ago, when major carmakers were accused of using “cheat” software to fake emissions results. … Threads: Andy Stone / @andymstone : Advertiser verification is just one tool to address scam activity.  It is not a silver bullet; Reuters' own reporting shows this.  Regardless, in concert with other efforts, we are expanding advertiser verification and in 2025 over 70 percent of ads revenue came from verified advertisers. Andy Stone / @andymstone : Yet again, @reuters' reporting misrepresents the facts and mischaracterizes Meta's efforts and motivation.  We are aggressively combatting scam activity via a multi-layered approach.  Over the last 15 months, we've seen a more than 50 percent reduction in fraud and scams on platform. Andy Stone / @andymstone : We use many methods to reduce scam activity and teams do check the Ad Library to find ads not caught by our enforcement.  If team members see them, they remove the ads from Facebook and Instagram.  Reuters would prefer we leave the scam ads up so people on Facebook and Instagram see them?? Andy Stone / @andymstone : Leave it to @reuters to fault Meta for removing scam ads from Facebook and Instagram.  What disingenuous reporting.

The tokens will be created and distributed with help from https://crypto.com/ using blockchain tech. These tokens are rewards related to Trump Media products. Ann Vandersteel™ / @annvandersteel : So the Trump Media Technology Group ($TMTG) has figured out how to stop the naked short selling of their stock.  GREAT NEWS!  The SEC and FINRA has protected the industry titans who have relentlessly sold naked shorts and made billions over the years doing so.  This new move by TMTG will END THAT fraud from happening.  The MMTLP community still needs accountability.  As do all investors who have been harmed by naked short selling like GME, AMC etc. @joealertz : $DJT The New Year's news to issue Blockchain tokens to every shareholder holder is mainly to squeeze naked shorts and reward shareholders in the process. I think big short squeeze is unfolding with this name [image] @byzgeneral : Personally I can't wait for another Trump family scam! Peter Schiff / @peterschiff : $DJT is up 6% today on news that the company will distribute digital tokens to shareholders. Unlike dividends paid from real earnings, DJT can keep losing money while creating worthless tokens out of thin air to distribute instead. Hype over reality sums up the Trump economy too.

Here's the full writeup, free to read for a week, and my thoughts in more detail below. https://www.bloomberg.com/... Vlad Savov / @vladsavov : I detail more of the imperfections and foibles in the review, but the short version is that Samsung's charging a premium price for something that's just there to prove it can be done. A proof of concept that does nothing to quell foldable iPhone hype. https://www.bloomberg.com/... Vlad Savov / @vladsavov : Would be praiseworthy if not for the giant camera module that's thicker than any individual panel and makes the tablet lopsided. It's no great joy to hold because of its weight imbalance and you can never lay it down flat. [image] Vlad Savov / @vladsavov : Also, the crease problem is still a problem. This thing costs more than an iPad Pro + whichever high-end phone you prefer, yet it asks you to accept such a visible and tangible compromise. Like selling a luxury watch with scratched glass and saying, you won't *always* notice it.
