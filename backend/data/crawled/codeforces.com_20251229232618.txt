Educational Codeforces Round 186 [Rated for Div. 2]

By awoo, history, 25 hours ago, translation, 

Hello Codeforces!

The series of Educational Rounds continues thanks to the support of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) program at Neapolis University Pafos, with scholarships provided by JetBrains.

Educational Codeforces Round 186 (Rated for Div. 2) will start on Monday, December 29, 2025 at 23:35UTC+9.

This round will be rated for the participants with rating lower than 2100. It will be held on extended ICPC rules. The penalty for each incorrect submission until the submission with a full solution is 10 minutes. After the end of the contest, you will have 12 hours to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.

You will be given 6-7 problems and 2 hours to solve them.

The problems were invented and prepared by Adilbek adedalic Dalabaev, Ivan BledDest Androsov, Maksim Neon Mescheryakov, Roman Roms Glazov, Maksim FelixArg Novotochinov and me. Also, huge thanks to Mike MikeMirzayanov Mirzayanov for great systems Polygon and Codeforces.

Good luck to all the participants!

And on the occasion of the New Year — Happy New Year!

We wish you clear ideas, strong solutions, and many ACs in the year ahead.

Goodbye, 2025. Hello, 2026!

By MikeMirzayanov, history, 4 days ago, 

Goodbye, 2025. Hello, 2026!

Dear Santa, Please make 2026 a happy year—not just for me, but for everyone. We all need this.

Hello, 2026!

And of course, we have our traditional gifts!

 Change Handle Feature

Hurry! Until January 10, you can change your handle (but only once)! Note that next time you will be able to roll back the change or request another handle change only after a year (in December 2026). Choose wisely!

You can change your handle to a new one that hasn't been used by anyone else, or to one that you've previously used. Links to your old profile will automatically redirect to your updated profile.

Again this year, if you've participated in at least 10 rounds, you can request the handle of an inactive participant. This means the participant must have had a period of activity on Codeforces lasting at most 180 days, and this activity must have occurred in 2022 or earlier. The inactive participant must not have posted comments, messages, or similar content, and they must not have participated receiving 'Accepted' in more than 2 contests. In such cases, the handle will be automatically renamed, and the original owner will be notified via email. If the original user requests their handle back, we will roll back the change and restore your previous handle.

If you're unable to change your handle, it means some of the requirements have not been met. Please do not ask me to intervene manually. I especially dislike requests such as, "This is my second account; I took an interesting handle myself." I'm not Santa Claus!

Speaking of handles, I always reminisce about one particular story. Once, a user sent me this message: "Please change my handle from I_love_Valya to I_love_Sveta, as I no longer love Valya..."

New Year's Masquerade of Colors and Ranks

The traditional magical tab has appeared in your profile settings. Happy New Year!

Codeforces Round 1071 (Div. 3)

By spycoderyt, 11 days ago, 
Hello, Codeforces!

IceBorworntat, NortGlG, omsincoconut, and I are excited to invite everyone to Codeforces Round 1071 (Div. 3), which will take place on Tuesday, December 23, 2025 at 23:45UTC+9. You will be offered 8 problems, and you will be given 2 hours and 30 minutes to solve them.

Please note that this contest contains at least one interactive problem and at least one run-twice problem. Please read the guides for interactive problems and run-twice problems before the contest if you are unfamiliar with them.

The round will be hosted by the rules of educational rounds (extended ICPC). Thus, all solutions will be judged on preliminary tests during the round, and after the round, there will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks. After the open hack phase, all accepted solutions will be rejudged on successful hacks. Also, note that there is no score distribution—rank will be determined by number of problems solved, followed by penalty; wrong submissions will incur the usual penalty of 10 minutes, following the rules of educational rounds.

As a reminder, only trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official standings table. This is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participant of the third division, you must:

take part in (and solve at least one problem in) at least five rated rounds
and not have had a rating of 1900 or higher at any moment in time.

Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you (unless you register unrated).

For Codeforces contests—including this one—improper use of artificial intelligence is severely condemned.

We would like to thank:

sleepntsheep, Marszpace for their problem contributions and valuable help during the preparation of this contest.
cry for great coordination and support throughout the preparation process.
MikeMirzayanov for great Codeforces and Polygon platforms.
temporary1, LMeyling, Intellegent, Argentum47, SpyrosAliv, catgirl, ritam1234, Proof_by_QED, ttamx, tin.le2, Ermiooo158, Mysticmage45, efishel, kwant, gentlecoder29, macaquedev, chromate00, dazlersan1, ALnQ417 for testing the round.
You for participating in the round.
blackslex for no particular reason! Really, no reason!

We hope that you guys will enjoy the problems.

ICPC NEF и ВКОШП 2025

By NercNews, 3 weeks ago, translation, 

Hi, Codeforces!

December is the perfect time to wrap up the year, and we’re happy to invite you to follow the final stages of the most important school and student team competitions in competitive programming. Mark your calendars: from December 15 to 17, the 26th Russian Team Olympiad in High School Programming Contest and the ICPC Northern Eurasia Finals 2025 will take place.

The official opening of the championships will be on Monday, December 15. The detailed schedule is available on the website.

On our accounts, we’ll be sharing updates about the participants and their results. As usual, we’ve put together a list of useful materials in a single post; it will be updated gradually so you can conveniently follow the progress of the competitions and cheer for your favorites. By the way, who do you think will become the champions of RTO HSPC and NEF?

ICPC Northern Eurasia Finals
Live broadcast YT Split screens Mirror Contest Standings

The ICPC semifinals in our region celebrate their 30th anniversary this year — three decades of algorithmic contests that have brought together thousands of participants, hundreds of practice contests, months of preparation, multi-stage regional selections, and bright, inspiring victories. What anniversary surprises have the organizers prepared this year? Stay tuned for the news — it’s going to be exciting!

This season, nearly 3,000 teams took part in all qualification stages, and only 341 of them made it to the Northern Eurasia Finals. You can see how the regional contests went on the ICPC NERC page for this season on icpc.global, as well as in our gallery, where we’ve collected photos from the quarterfinals and qualification rounds. We also gathered team reactions from Saint Petersburg and Moscow during the quarterfinals — you can find them here.

The student team championship, as in previous years, is held in a distributed format across Saint Petersburg, Almaty, Novosibirsk, and Tbilisi. Already on Wednesday, December 17, the teams will face a crucial intellectual battle that will determine the finalists of ICPC 2026, who will represent Northern Eurasia on the world stage. The venue of the next final has not yet been announced, but we’re eagerly awaiting the news and guessing where it might take place.

For those who are not participating in the NEF, there will be an opportunity to solve the same problems in the “mirror” contest here on the platform. Registration is already open!

Join the live stream of the ICPC Northern Eurasia Finals contest on Wednesday, December 17, at 10:00 (utc+3), and the live stream of the closing ceremony scheduled for 17:00, to be the first to find out everything!

RTO HSPC 2025
Live broadcast YT Split Screen

On Tuesday, December 16, the main round of the RTO HSPC 2025 school team championship will take place. Based on the qualification results, 266 teams have been invited to compete. As with the student contests, the final round is held in a distributed format across several cities: 156 teams will compete at Lakhta Hall in Saint Petersburg, 72 teams in Almaty (Kazakhstan), 28 teams in Novosibirsk, and another 10 teams in Sirius.

The main round of the Russian Team Olympiad in High School Programming Contest, along with the live stream, will start on Tuesday at 10:00 Moscow time — join us to watch the next generation of young talents. We will find out who becomes the RTO HSPC champion later the same day during the closing ceremony live stream at 17:00.

Tag your favorites in the comments and wish them good luck!

Codeforces Round 1069

By KAN, 4 weeks ago, 

Hi Codeforces!

On Saturday, December 6, 2025 at 17:15UTC+9 we will hold Codeforces Round 1069 (Div. 1) and Codeforces Round 1069 (Div. 2). Note the unusual starting time!

The harder problems of this round are based on the problems from the Final round of Yandex Cup 2025, Algorithms track, that will be held at the same time.

The problems are authored by lait1103, heesooyaam, I_love_kirill22, LeoPro, isaf27, elshiko, Flyce with guest problems from napstablook, sunkuangzheng, and great help from Vladithur, Dominater069, and tourist.

I'd like to thank Um_nik, Akulyat, okwedook, Merkurev, conqueror_of_tourist, Dominater069, ntherner, Limitiym, Iguanado for testing the round, and MikeMirzayanov for the Polygon and Codeforces systems.

Because the official Yandex Cup Finals ends later than the round on Codeforces, the upsolving, solutions, and test cases will be closed until the end of the onsite contest, roughly 3 hours after the end of the Codeforces round. It is also forbidden to discuss the problems publicly until the end of the onsite round. Any comments here concerning the problems will be removed.

P.S. Same as with many rounds based on onsite contests, you can expect that the difficulty curve may be different from the one typical for Codeforces rounds. This is mostly connected with the limited amount of testing we can do to avoid problem leakage, and with the limited choice of problems. Nevertheless, I believe that it's better to have a round than not have one, and I hope you'll enjoy the problems!

Good luck!

Scoring distribution: you'll see in the contest.

UPD: there is live stream with problem discussions and comments here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R7iwYAXKLY
