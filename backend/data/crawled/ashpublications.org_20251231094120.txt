ASH Clinical News, a monthly news magazine designed for clinical practitioners in hematology/oncology, provides timely updates on key medical meetings, practice-changing clinical trials, and relevant policy issues. Regular features include in-depth cover stories on health care issues affecting the field, clinical consults, interviews with practicing hematologists, and updates on Society initiatives.

ASH News Daily, the official newspaper of the ASH annual meeting, highlights each day’s sessions and events. Each year, the ASH News Daily website contains articles and other features — written by an Editorial Board composed of distinguished ASH members —that cover the four days of the meeting.

The ASH-SAP is a high-quality educational product offering up-to-date information in the field of hematology for internists, hematologists, pediatricians, and hematology-oncology fellows.

The Blood Journals are the premier scholarly resource for hematologists worldwide. Since the founding of Blood in 1946, the Blood Journals have been a trusted source for basic, translational, and clinical research. Each journal is led by an editorial team of active scientists and clinicians who are top experts in their area.

Hematology, the ASH Education Program, is published annually and provides in-depth chapters covering each session presented in the ASH Annual Meeting Education Program.

ASH’s bimonthly member newsletter, The Hematologist: ASH News and Reports, is designed for the broad constituency of ASH, ranging from basic scientists to practicing clinicians. The Hematologist updates readers about important breakthroughs, trials, and literature; publishes expert advice for clinicians; and spotlights the latest ASH programs and initiatives .
