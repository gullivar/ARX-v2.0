“Not your typical dating app.
Just probably the best.”

Real stories. Real sparks. Straight from our users.

Calvin & Natasha

“We matched over a shared love of art — then signed up for a pottery class just for fun. By the end of it, we weren’t just molding clay — we were shaping something real. Thanks to tantan, we found more than just a date... we found each other.”

Priya & Marcus

“We met at a Majulah Singlepura event and  bonded over music, memes, and our mutual obsession with good wine. Our first date was supposed to be ‘just one drink’... but we closed the place down. Now we laugh over wine nights, plan weekend getaways, and still can’t agree on red or white. Thanks to tantan, we found a connection that’s way more than just a match.”

Wai Loong & Jasmine

“I spent most of my life focused on work — late nights, early mornings, no time for dating. Downloading tantan felt like a shot in the dark… until I joined one of their pickleball events, just to try something new. That’s where I met Jasmine. We rallied, we laughed, and somewhere between serves and slices, we clicked. tantan didn’t just get me back into dating — it gave me someone worth slowing down for.”

Jayden & Antonio

“We both joined tantan thinking, ‘Okay, let’s just see what’s out there.’ No pressure, no expectations — just curiosity. Then we matched. Our first convo lasted 6 hours, and somehow felt like 10 minutes. From memes to deep life talks, it just clicked. tantan gave us the space to be ourselves, and the chance to find each other — no filters, no games, just something real.”
