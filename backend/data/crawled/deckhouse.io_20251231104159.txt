The challenge was to find a cost-effective way to manage its infrastructure. Leroy Merlin Russia has selected Deckhouse Platform as a tool to manage all their clusters in 4 different data centers and clouds (OpenStack, vSphere, Yandex.Cloud). Ever since it was put into implementation, the customer has benefitted from enormous observability and single-window control. Simple texting An all-in-one text messaging service High loads are no longer a problem All of SimpleTexting’s services were based on virtual machines and had to ensure that high loads could be supported without any hiccups. SimpleTexting selected Deckhouse as the most convenient NoOps Kubernetes platform, in particular enjoying the advantages of autoscaling as traffic continues to spike. Lalafo Free ad platform Kubernetes from the first sight Lalafo had never used Kubernetes before, but they were having trouble handling high loads and were in search of a failover solution, so they decided to give it a shot. The Deckhouse clusters in lalafo have ensured the functionality of the failover structure which utilizes the full power of Istio to organize a service mesh. 3 Commas Smart trading terminal and auto trading bots for cryptocurrency exchanges Scalability intacked 3Commas had deployed all of its microservices on VMs but it was held back by a lack of scalability and robustness in the event of rapid traffic influxes.
