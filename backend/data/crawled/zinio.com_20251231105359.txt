Blanch the broccoli florets and green beans in boiling salted water for about 1 minute to keep this verdant veggie round-up bright green. Transfer to an ice bath to cool quickly.

Forgo traditional container gardens, and extend your tree-trimming skills to the entryway. “This fun and easy collection of evergreens in baskets could dress up a porch or foyer all winter but still feels holiday-esque,” says Mark Thompson, co-owner of Shoppe, a Birmingham home-and-garden store. You can use a variety of trees, cut or rooted in pots. He selected a Charlie Brown-style blue Atlas cedar (top left) as well as (in ascending order from bottom left) two Arizona cypresses, a ‘Red Star’ white cedar, two Italian cypresses, a ‘Blue Point’ Chinese juniper, and a silver tip fir. He placed each potted evergreen in a basket, nestled moss around the plants to hide the vessels, and tucked in pinecones for a decorative flourish, attaching larger ones with florist… 4 min Save The Christmas Magazine | 2025 Christmas decoration trends This year our four trends all make a statement – and they’re a nod to a few key interior trends that have popped up this year. We have Maximalism, Candy Circus, Nostalgia and Elegant Metallics, there’s definitely something for everyone this year. And if you can’t choose? Pick the elements you love from each and make up your own theme. 
TREND 1 
MAXIMALISM 
Maximalism has really come to the fore this year and it’s for those who adore colour and pattern. If this is you, then this Christmas trend is ideal – think clashing colours with fabulous decorative aspects. Any colour goes and there’s no limit to how many decorations you choose – the more the merrier! 
Choose decorations that have a sense of fun and are vibrant in colour.… 3 min Save The Christmas Magazine | 2025 THE FINISHING TOUCHES After the food has been ordered and presents are wrapped, don’t forget to give your home that extra bit of festive attention. It can be as simple as an indoor wreath, staircase garland or some Christmas bedding. 
DECORATE YOUR MANTLEPIECE AND WINDOWSILLS 
Place a trio of tea light holders around your home. House shaped designs have become really popular in recent years, the cut out windows allow light to bounce through perfectly. 
HANG A WREATH IN YOUR BATHROOM 
Bathrooms can be neglected during the festive season so give yours some love with a faux wreath. Hang it from ribbon in front of your window for a spot of texture and colour. 
CANDLES SET THE SCENE 
Even if you use candles all year round, swapping them out for a festive design… 2 min Save The Magic of Christmas Christmas at the Movies Miracle on 34th Street (1947) 
Sweet-natured retiree Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) is hired by jaded Macy’s HR staffer and divorced mom Doris Walker (Maureen O’Hara) to play store Santa Claus. For Kringle, it’s not just a seasonal gig—he insists he actually is Santa. When a staff shrink tries to get Kris committed, lawyer Fred Gailey (John Payne), who is sweet on Doris, defends the old gent in a hearing—and proves he’s the “real” Claus (with an assist from the Postal Service). Featuring an 8-year-old Natalie Wood as Doris’s precocious, Santa-skeptical daughter. 
It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) 
Perhaps the most beloved of all Christmas films, Frank Capra’s long-forgotten fantasy became a TV perennial when a lapsed copyright renewal in 1974 released it into the public domain. George Bailey (James Stewart), a… 4 min Save The Magic of Christmas “All I Want for Christmas Is You”: Q&A with Mariah Carey MARIAH CAREY may be fighting a bout of food poisoning when she jumps on the phone to chat about her permanent holiday classic “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” but she’s in relatively good cheer. “I’m still getting over it, but that’s a whole other story,” she says of being sick. “That’s not festive.” What is festive: Even 25 years after the song’s release [Ed. note: This interview took place in 2019], it’s almost impossible to go through winter without hearing the song blasting on the radio, at a party, or in a department store. The song is also one of Carey’s most commercially successful tracks, no small feat for someone who already has 19 number-one hits to date (and that includes “All I Want for Christmas Is You,”… 6 min Save Tech & Gaming View All PCWorld - December 2025 PCWorld December 2025 Macworld - January 2026 Macworld January 2026 Stereophile - January 2026 Stereophile January 2026 Games World of Puzzles - December 2025 Games World of Puzzles December 2025 MacLife - January 2026 MacLife January 2026 The Absolute Sound - January 2026 The Absolute Sound January 2026 T3 - January 2026 T3 January 2026 Windows 11 The Complete Manual - Issue 8 Windows 11 The Complete Manual Issue 8 Popular Mechanics - January/February 2026 Popular Mechanics January/February 2026 AppleMagazine - #739 AppleMagazine #739 Home & Garden View All Better Homes and Gardens - December 2025 Better Homes and Gardens December 2025 Family Handyman - December/January 2026 Family Handyman December/January 2026 Southern Living - December 2025 Southern Living December 2025 Victoria - January/February 2026 Victoria January/February 2026 Country Living UK - January 2026 Country Living UK January 2026 ELLE DECOR - Winter 2026 ELLE DECOR Winter 2026 House Beautiful - November/December 2025 House Beautiful November/December 2025 Veranda - January/February 2026 Veranda January/February 2026 MILIEU - Winter 2026 MILIEU Winter 2026 House and Garden - January 2026 House and Garden January 2026 Travel & Outdoor View All National Geographic Traveller (UK) - January / February 2026 National Geographic Traveller (UK) January / February 2026 TREAD - January/February 2026 TREAD January/February 2026 Conde Nast Traveler - January/February 2026 Conde Nast Traveler January/February 2026 Guns of the Old West - Winter 2024 Guns of the Old West Winter 2024 Blade - January 2026 Blade January 2026 Travel + Leisure - Most Beautiful Places 2026 Travel + Leisure Most Beautiful Places 2026 Garden & Gun - December/January 2026 Garden & Gun December/January 2026 Country Style - December 2025 Country Style December 2025 5280 Magazine - January 2026 5280 Magazine January 2026 POPEYE(ポパイ) - Jan2026-28066-130069851-001-001 POPEYE(ポパイ) Jan2026-28066-130069851-001-001 Food & Wine View All Bake from Scratch - January/February 2026 Bake from Scratch January/February 2026 Southern Living - December 2025 Southern Living December 2025 Victoria - January/February 2026 Victoria January/February 2026 Wine Spectator - December 31, 2025 Wine Spectator December 31, 2025 TeaTime - January/February 2026 TeaTime January/February 2026 Allrecipes - 100 Best Recipes - Winter 2025 Allrecipes 100 Best Recipes - Winter 2025 Bon Appetit - December 2025/January 2026 Bon Appetit December 2025/January 2026 Food Network Magazine - December/January 2026 Food Network Magazine December/January 2026 Louisiana Cookin' - January/February 2026 Louisiana Cookin' January/February 2026 Cook's Illustrated - January/February 2026 Cook's Illustrated January/February 2026 Cars & Motorcycles View All MotorTrend - Winter 2026 MotorTrend Winter 2026 Car and Driver - January/February 2026 Car and Driver January/February 2026 Gentlemen Drive - Issue 49 Gentlemen Drive Issue 49 TREAD - January/February 2026 TREAD January/February 2026 Octane - February 2026 Octane February 2026 Hot Rod - Winter 2025 Hot Rod Winter 2025 Evo - January 2026 Evo January 2026 BBC Top Gear Magazine - January 2026 BBC Top Gear Magazine January 2026 Great Model Railroads - 2026 Great Model Railroads 2026 Classic Truck Performance - Volume 7, Issue 65 - January 2026 Classic Truck Performance Volume 7, Issue 65 - January 2026 ABOUT Why ZINIO?
