Start with low code, deploy fast, and govern AI workflows with confidence. Building intelligent experiences on GraphOS Building intelligent experiences on GraphOS Deliver tomorrow's roadmap today with Apollo The GraphOS platform enables backend teams to build a self-service, self-documenting graph that can power any number of applications. Define data once, deliver anywhere Eliminate accumulated technical debt from backends-for-frontends or experience APIs. GraphQL federation provides a secure source of truth for the data that powers your business. Reduce boilerplate code. Backend teams contribute to a unified and composable platform instead of building one-off backends-for-frontends or experience APIs. Create consistent user experiences. By introducing composability, your teams only have to define core entities and business logic once. Then ship anywhere, across any interface. Deliver features faster GraphQL enables teams to deliver feature improvements and experiments faster by decoupling the backend and the frontend. GraphOS provides teams with the tools they need to deliver these benefits at any scale. Streamline collaboration across backend teams. Provide a central registry and standardized workflows for backend teams to work better together. Provide self-service for frontend teams. Apollo’s architecture enables frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single endpoint, no matter where it is stored. Improve performance across applications GraphQL reduces latency by enabling frontend teams to fetch all of the data they need from a single request. Optimize GraphQL's performance gains even more with Apollo GraphOS. Reduce latency across applications. GraphQL reduces unnecessary network calls that slow your apps down. Take advantage of these benefits at a broader scale using GraphOS Router. Diagnose issues quickly. GraphOS provides GraphQL-native metrics to improve performance. Export these numbers into DataDog or OpenTelemetry for further analysis. Enterprise teams trust Apollo Enterprises rely on Apollo to unify their APIs into a single, discoverable, and reusable platform that adapts to any use case. Product development teams can work independently, reuse APIs, and deliver new features lightning-fast while benefiting from modularity, optionality, and autonomy. Matt Sexton Solutions Architect at Booking.com “We wanted to move from our monolithic architecture to a modern distributed architecture that allows us to deploy new features independently. When teams have more autonomy, the speed of delivery is greatly improved. We also want to ensure the consistency of data, access to that data, and treat all of our clients as if they are the same consumer of the same data.” Stephan Lonntorp Senior Engineering Manager at Volvo Cars “We want our entire business on the supergraph because we think it’s better than those dusty old REST API’s. We wouldn’t have an accurate online shopping experience without the supergraph.” Deep Varma CTO at Varo “Really, it’s speed and agility that’s going to take you to the next level, rather than the technology itself. That’s why I get so excited about the supergraph.” Marcelo Nalon Staff Engineer at Globoplay “Apollo GraphOS is a key platform for the development team to work softly with GraphQL. It provides a bunch of tools and APIs that allow us to establish a secure development pipeline to compose and deliver new pieces to our supergraph.” Mark Faga Senior Staff Software Engineer, Wayfair “Had contracts not existed, Wayfair would’ve invested 100s of person hours building out custom infrastructure to replicate what we get “built-in,” freeing up time to focus on Wayfair customer needs and developer experience.” Rick Fast SVP of Engineering, Expedia “Using Apollo’s unified graph, Expedia rebuilt our entire trips experience 3x faster than our old approach. Adding new trip features to all our apps now takes days rather than months.” Robbie Sawers Director of Engineering, Zillow Offers “We introduced a new subgraph in the federated graph [for backend compliance logic when Zillow was becoming a brokerage], and it was a complete success … 70 systems migrated without any advance, and we had the deadline, right on the dot.” Matt Sexton Solutions Architect at Booking.com “We wanted to move from our monolithic architecture to a modern distributed architecture that allows us to deploy new features independently.
