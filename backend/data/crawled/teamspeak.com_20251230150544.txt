WHY TEAMSPEAK?
THERE IS A REASON THAT TEAMSPEAK IS THE FIRST CHOICE FOR PRO ESPORTS.

Forget that we provide the best voice quality available. Forget that we provide military-grade security, ultra low latency, the lowest resource usage of any VoIP software and 3D surround sound as standard.

As a TeamSpeak user, we know you expect the best.

What really makes TeamSpeak different, is that YOU are in complete control.

Unlike other solutions, we don’t force you to use our centralized servers. We don’t harvest your data, then sell it on. We don’t tell you how things should work or look.

It’s your choice. We let YOU decide.

TeamSpeak. Your Team. Your Rules.

TEAMSPEAK. TRIED. TESTED. TRUSTED.
An out-of-this-world VoIP solution. TeamSpeak supplies mission-critical voice communication solutions to some of the world’s finest.
