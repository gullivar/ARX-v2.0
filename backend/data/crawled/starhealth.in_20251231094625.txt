Download STAR Health App Understanding Health Insurance How Health Insurance Works? Health insurance is designed to give you peace of mind and financial security during medical emergencies. Here’s a step-by-step guide to understand how it works. 1 Getting Started with Your Policy Health Insurance is a contract between you (the policyholder) and Star Health. You pay a premium, and in return, Star Health provides financial cover for medical expenses as per the policy terms and conditions. Coverage includes hospitalization, surgeries, treatments, and other healthcare needs depending on the plan chosen. Policies can be purchased directly from Star Health's branches, advisors, the website or through the registered intermediaries. 2 Understanding Your Premium Your premium value depends on several factors such as the type of plan you select, the sum insured, your age, medical history, lifestyle, policy tenure, and any add-ons you choose. If you opt for a family floater plan, the premium is calculated based on the number of family members covered, their ages, and overall health conditions. This ensures your entire family can be protected under a single plan. Ensure transparency and full disclosure for maximum benefits. 3 Intimate a Claim In case of hospitalization or treatment, you can file a claim in two ways. Cashless Claim: When treated at one of Star Health’s network hospitals, bills are settled directly with the hospital so you can focus on recovery. Reimbursement Claim: If you have paid for your medical expenses, you can get the expenses reimbursed from Star Health by submitting the required bills and all other documents. Claims can be initiated online, through the Star Health mobile app, at the hospital’s help-desk, via email, or through the 24x7 call centre. The status of your claim can be tracked on the Star Health app. Claims settlement is subject to the policy terms and conditions. Disclaimer: Insurance is a subject matter of solicitation. Standard terms and conditions apply. Benefits, coverage, and premiums may vary based on the chosen plan, age, health condition, and other factors. Please read the policy brochure carefully before purchase.
