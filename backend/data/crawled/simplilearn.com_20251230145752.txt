“Three weeks after finishing the course, I was hired as a Cloud Engineer, doubling my salary and successfully switching domains!”

The AWS and Azure classes were incredibly helpful, with an instructor who made advanced technology easy to understand and shared valuable insights. The course interface and live sessions were excellent, and year-long access to recordings lets me keep learning. Three weeks after completing the course, I was hired as a Cloud Engineer, doubling my salary and switching domains!

“This course made it possible for me to get a new job in the programming and automation field without any prior experience in DevOps.”

I had no experience in DevOps, but Simplilearn’s program helped me secure a job in programming and automation. The course served as a launchpad for my career. Shortly after completing it, I was hired as a GIS Developer.

"Hands-on projects and expert training helped me transition to cybersecurity, land a new job, and achieve a salary increase of 55%."

After completing my course, I landed a cybersecurity project at work and soon secured a SOC Analyst role, leveraging skills like vulnerability analysis and penetration testing. The course also helped me transition to a new role at BetaNXT with a salary increase of 55%. Hands-on projects and comprehensive content were key to this career switch.

“After a decade on the Support Desk and hitting a plateau, Simplilearn’s AI/ML course helped me upskill and become a Module Lead with a 50% pay raise."

After a decade on the Support Desk, I felt my career had stalled. Simplilearn’s program offered a clear path from basics to intermediate skills, transforming me into a Machine Learning specialist and Data Scientist. It deepened my understanding of industry standards and helped me transition to the role of a Module Lead with a 50% pay raise.
