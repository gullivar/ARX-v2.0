A RPC node provider is a service that runs and maintains blockchain nodes for you and exposes them through Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interfaces. By connecting to the best RPC provider like Chainstack, you get instant, always-on access to reliable nodes without having to build or secure the infrastructure yourself. Is the managed RPC node secure? Yes. Every RPC node instance on Chainstack is isolated, encrypted in transit and at rest, and shielded by automated DDoS protection. You can also restrict access with IP whitelists, origins, and private credentials, so only your app can reach the endpoint. Learn more . What is an RPC node? An RPC node is a full or archive blockchain node that exposes standard JSON-RPC or gRPC methods. It listens to new blocks, stores historical data, and answers calls so your application can read from or write to the chain with low-latency. What is an RPC URL? An RPC URL is the complete address of an endpoint, including protocol, host, and unique project path or token. Point your web3 library at this URL to start building immediately. What is a dedicated node? A dedicated node is an exclusive machine or cluster that only your organization can use. You choose the region, client, and configuration, gaining maximum performance, predictable latency, and full access to debug & trace APIs, archive data, and custom plug-ins. What is an elastic node? An elastic node also known as a Global Node on Chainstack: is a geo-balanced, autoscaled endpoint backed by multiple instances around the world. It automatically routes traffic to the fastest location, absorbs traffic spikes, and ensures zero-downtime service for high-throughput dApps.
