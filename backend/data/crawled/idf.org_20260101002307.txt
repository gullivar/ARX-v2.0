I believe strongly in the power of education for families and communities to challenge myths and save lives. Christina Yap (Malaysia) Over the years, I've seen how the emotional side of diabetes – fear, stigma and burnout – is often overlooked even though it affects health just as much as physical symptoms. These experiences inspire me to advocate for a kinder, more holistic approach to diabetes care. One that values both physical and psychological well-being. Diego Bartra Bazán (Peru) Access to innovation, diabetes education and public policies is far too limited in my country. Managing diabetes is an uphill battle. I’m here to change that and to make sure these challenges are recognised globally.
