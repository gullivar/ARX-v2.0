Wednesday, January 27th, 2021 - Qbix We have created a workaround for Linux users who have problems  with the keyboard, where it appears as if you stopped pressing a key. Please download the following patch: 74-3-events.diff Wednesday, June 26th, 2019 - Qbix DOSBox 0.74-3 has been released! A security release for DOSBox 0.74: Fixed that a very long line inside a bat file would overflow the parsing buffer. (CVE-2019-7165 by Alexandre Bartel) Added a basic permission system so that a program running inside DOSBox can't access the contents of /proc (e.g. /proc/self/mem) when / or /proc were (to be) mounted. (CVE-2019-12594 by Alexandre Bartel) Several other fixes for out of bounds access and buffer overflows. Some fixes to the OpenGL rendering. The game compatibility should be identical to 0.74 and 0.74-2. It's recommended to use config -securemode when dealing with untrusted files. Ideally, 0.75 should have been released by now, but some bugs took a lot longer than expected. Thursday, December 13th, 2018 - Qbix GOG .COM have started their WinterSale 2018!
