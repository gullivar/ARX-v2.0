            systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking,
            e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in
            support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. Erlang Quickstart What is OTP? OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to
            develop these systems. It includes its own distributed database, applications to interface
            towards other languages, debugging and release handling tools.
