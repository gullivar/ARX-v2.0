As a managed hosting provider we are always looking for quality products that will help us increase efficiency and stability as well as improve the overall performance from our servers. We deployed CloudLinux on our shared hosting servers, and we have seen an immediate improvement in reliability. Now we want to offer the same solution to our dedicated server customers. Emmanuel Vivar, CEO I installed [CloudLinux OS] on Sunday night. It was pretty easy. I’m also amazed at how much it has brought our CPU usage down. I thought caging the different accounts in a virtual environment would put more of a load on our server, but this has done the opposite. Before, our total CPU usage was between 50 – 90% during the day and now it is around 6 – 30%. I’m not sure how or what did this, but I’ll take it! Thank you… Chuck Mannella, COO bHosted.nl use CloudLinux for all servers, from Webhosting / VPS / Dedicated servers. It’s a stable OS, we are very happy in combination with Imunify360 and Kernelcare. And if they are any problems contact the support and you get a very fast and good answer on your question. Stefan Bottelier We’ve been really stable selling shared hosting and CloudLinux did it for us (after a number of battles trying to solve the hiccup)! It was like magic! Ahmad Mukoshy, Founder I´m running this company for 20 years, we use many vendors in the market and I’m using CloudLinux services for only one week. What I can say is: you have the BEST support service from the whole industry. You guys just rock! Diogo Lopes, CEO This is the equivalent of changing the engine on an airplane while it’s flying. I think this will be viewed as a no-brainer purchase when you consider the cost of less than $50 annually per server for having the protection of kernel security updates without downtime. Dan Olds, principal analyst A lot of hosters are finding their niche, but if you are a “generic” hosting company, you have to focus on the quality of service and monetization. CloudLinux is here to help your business grow and expand. Igor Seletskiy CEO & Founder of CloudLinux Inc.
