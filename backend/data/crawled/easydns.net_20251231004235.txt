easyMail Email Defense
NEW: easyMail Email Defense

easyMail Email Defense Service (EDS) is an all-in-one email security solution designed to protect against modern threats. By combining multiple layers of protection at both the Gateway and API levels, it eliminates the need for multiple products. Phishing attacks, email fraud, and business email compromise (BEC) are stopped before they ever reach a user’s inbox.

Today’s email threats evolve quickly, and malicious files often look like everyday documents. easyMail EDS uses predictive security measures to stay one step ahead of emerging risks. It filters all internal, inbound, and outbound email traffic to shield organizations from email-borne threats and data leaks. With highly effective spam filtering and defense against phishing, malicious spam (malspam), business email compromise, and account takeover, easyMail EDS blocks over 99.9% of phishing and malspam attacks.
