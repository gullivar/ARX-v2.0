Why choose a brandable name?

Brandable names — whether invented company names like Spotify, Lyft, Hulu, or Etsy, or evocative two-word combos like PayPal, BlueApron, MailChimp, TaskRabbit, and DoorDash — make for especially cool startup names that are distinctive, memorable, and full of character. These powerful and creative combinations help your brand resonate with customers while leaving room for growth.

Memorable: Easy to recall and recommend.
Unique & Distinctive: Differentiates your business from competitors.
Visual & Evocative: Instantly creates imagery or conveys a feeling.
Scalable: Can evolve alongside your products or services.
Why choose a .com domain?

A .com domain is the most recognized and trusted domain extension worldwide, widely viewed as the gold standard of online branding. Securing a .com name can significantly enhance your brand's credibility, visibility, and memorability.

Instant Credibility: Customers inherently trust brands with a .com extension.
Global Recognition: Universally familiar, enhancing your international reach.
High Memorability: Users easily recall names ending in ".com," boosting repeat visits.
Brand Protection: Owning your ".com" domain helps secure your brand identity from competitors or confusion.
Prevents Traffic Leaks: Users naturally default to typing ".com," preventing lost traffic and potential customers.
Your self-service brand naming platform
Start with the right name

One of the most common mistakes we see startups make is hastily registering any available .com domain, only to face costly rebranding later. Why does this happen so often? Simply put, nearly all memorable, brandable, and short domains were registered long ago, making it extremely difficult to find cool startup names or keyword-rich company names that truly resonate. Rebranding down the line wastes valuable time, drains resources, and disrupts your marketing momentum. Avoid wasting valuable time and marketing resources on rebranding by starting with the right name from the beginning.

Save Time by Choosing from the Best Curated Names

We understand the frustration. With over 150 million .com domains already registered, finding short, catchy business name ideas can feel impossible. That's exactly why we’ve done the hard work—and the negotiating—for you. Our platform provides instant access to 40,000+ expertly curated premium domains, including short names, cool startup names, and powerful keyword-driven company name ideas. Many of these aged domains were initially registered by businesses or investors years ago, and we’ve already negotiated the best prices upfront. Each domain is transparently priced, clearly listed, and hand-selected by branding experts, allowing you to quickly find and secure a memorable name within your startup-friendly budget.

Proven by Successful Startups You Already Know

You might have noticed that successful startups often share a common trait: a catchy, memorable, and distinctive brand name. Many of these companies got it right the first time by leveraging platforms like Brandsly. While some startups have spent fortunes working with naming agencies, we've simplified and streamlined the process, eliminating the usual hassle and uncertainty. No more aimless brainstorming or frustration over unavailable domains—just use our smart search tool and intuitive categorization, designed to help you quickly discover names that resonate with your vision. Our curated collections span hundreds of industries and styles, empowering you to confidently select a name that’s already been expertly validated. Just think of us like your self-service brand naming agency.
