Fraud Alert

Please be aware that the integration of Credit Suisse and UBS may see fraudsters attempting to contact our clients, purporting to be from our organisation or selling fake investment schemes from our entities. This could be a means to obtain your information or to trick you into sending money to a fraudulent account. Please be vigilant if you are contacted by an unknown party. UBS and Credit Suisse entities will never contact you by email, SMS or telephone with new bank account details or to ask you to login or reveal access or account details. We do not send emails with links to login pages such as e-banking and will never ask you for an e-banking contract number or pin. Before transferring money or sharing personal details, please contact only your usual UBS or Credit Suisse advisor or Client Services team; or if it is your first experience, contact UBS on 82-2-3702-8888.
