Change starts with clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene

Almost1in10
people don't have clean water close to home.

We're collaborating with local partners to find the best solution for getting clean water to every global community.

Almost 1 in 5
people don't have a decent toilet of their own.

We're working with partners to help install toilets and train local people to maintain them once we have gone.

 1 in 5
people don't have soap and/or water to wash their hands at home.

Good hygiene promotion is one of the most effective ways to improve global health. That's why we support hygiene education programmes across all our projects.

WaterAid began in 1981 because no charity like us existed. We’ll stop when no charity like us is needed. 

In the meantime, we’re focused on helping people break free from poverty and change their lives for good through the three essentials of clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene. With your support, we'll reach everyone, everywhere within a generation.

Changing lives across the world

We've reached 28.5 million with clean water and 29 million with toilets. Directly installing taps and toilets is vital, but we do much more. To make lasting change happen on a massive scale, we work together with communities, governments and service providers.
