Explore The Foundations Series FEATURING MUSIC FROM FAVORITES LIKE: CUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS What Others Are Saying About MakeMusic “The students really like the interactive side of 
being able to check fingerings and to double check
that they are playing everything correctly.
It really helped save time for me, 
especially since most weeks the students had 2 to 3 assignments.” Kimberly Beene Director of Bands, Arbor Creek Middle School “This program has helped encourage the students 
to practice more at home. If the students do not
understand a note or rhythm, MakeMusic provides the answer.
As one of my students put it: ‘Playing along with MakeMusic 
was like I was playing with others, not just myself 
alone in my room.’” Kelly Weddington Middle School Orchestra Director “We had an influx of students into the program 
and we realized very quickly that for us to be able
 to assess, hear, and provide tools for the students
 we needed something so we jumped in! 
We use MakeMusic for the kids on region music, 
import xml files on their marching music, 
we have them work on scales, technique, and solos so they can practice with accompaniment.
We’re really excited about it and look
forward to continuing to grow with it!” Brent Biskup and Jana Harvey Flower Mound High School, Texas Ready to take your musical journey to the next level? Get started for free Why Choose MakeMusic?
