Ev'rywhere you go,
Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in ev'ry store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben,
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen,
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go,
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

The reason is that his  words are very beautiful and I just cannot completey understand them but I'll try. In Hallelujah he seems to be saying that despite all the frailities and faults in his character there have been good and decent things in his life that would please whoever his higher power might be.  The minor fall  and major lift may mean that human mistakes are minor displeasures to his higher power but recovery from and repair of these faults are not only very difficult compared with the ease of the transgression but would also be a major uplifit to his higher power. That is just one of the symbols in this poem. It is surprizing that there is so much symbolism in these few, simple verses. more » Like Reply 7 years ago Olga Lazotaylor When I get Paul Mauriat song Lyrics will give my opinion.
