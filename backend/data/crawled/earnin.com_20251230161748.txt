EarnIn is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services are provided by our bank partners on certain products other than Cash Out.
EarnIn is a financial technology company, not a bank. The Cash Out product is provided exclusively by EarnIn. Certain bank products are provided by Evolve Bank & Trust and/or Lead Bank, Members FDIC. The FDIC insures deposits to protect your money in the event of a bank failure. More details about deposit insurance here. Additional services in the app are offered in partnership with trusted third parties.
1 EarnIn determines your daily and pay period limits ("Daily Max" and "Pay Period Max") based on your income and financial risk factors as outlined in the Cash Out User Agreement. EarnIn reserves the right to adjust the Daily Max and Pay Period Max at its discretion. Your actual Daily Max will be displayed in your EarnIn account before each Cash Out. For additional information about your Daily Max and Pay Period Max, please refer to our FAQ. Service may not be available in all states.

EarnIn does not charge interest on Cash Outs or mandatory fees for standard transfers, which usually take 1–2 business days. For faster transfers, you can choose the Lightning Speed option and pay a fee to receive funds within 30 minutes. Lightning Speed may not be available at all times and/or to all customers. See the Fee Table for details. Tips are optional and do not affect the quality or availability of services.
2 The EarnIn Card is issued by Evolve Bank & Trust (“Evolve”), pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A., Inc. Visa is a registered trademark of Visa International Service Association. All other trademarks, service marks, and other registered marks are the property of their respective owners. To obtain an EarnIn Card you must (i) open a Deposit Account and a Secured Account with one of our bank partners through the EarnIn app; (ii) update your direct deposit routing with your employer so that you receive at least $1,000 per month into your Deposit Account; and (iii) pre-authorize our bank partner to automatically transfer all funds from your Deposit Account to your Secured Account. The funds in your Secured Account will be used to cover the purchases you make with your EarnIn Card (the “Card Balances”). If the funds in your Secured Account are insufficient to fully cover the Card Balances, the remaining amount will be debited from the bank account you linked in the EarnIn app.
The “Available” amount shown in the EarnIn app reflects the total amount you can spend on the Card, this includes money in your Secured Account plus a portion of your unpaid earnings (up to $1,500 per pay period). You can use up to $1,500 per day for purchases and up to $300 per day for cash advances.
Applicable fees are listed here. The EarnIn Card is available to eligible EarnIn members in select states. Additional terms and restrictions may apply. For more information, please refer to our FAQs and the Cardholder Agreement and Security Agreements.
3 Early Pay is an optional feature that allows you to access your paycheck up to two days early. To use Early Pay, you must:
(i) Open a Deposit Account with one of our bank partners, Evolve Bank & Trust or Lead Bank, both Member FDIC. Funds held in the Deposit Account are held with our partner banks, and are insured up to $250,000 in the event the bank partner fails and if specific deposit insurance requirements are met. Learn more here; and
(ii) Update your direct deposit routing with your employer. This Deposit Account will receive your paycheck and will redirect it to the bank account linked to your EarnIn account. Before transferring, EarnIn will set aside the necessary funds from your paycheck to cover any tips, Lightning Speed fees, and Cash-Out balances from the previous pay period (the "Balances"). Any remaining funds will be transferred to your linked bank account. If your paycheck does not fully cover the Balances, EarnIn may debit the remaining amount from your linked external bank account, as allowed in the Transfer Out Payment Authorization.
Fees. If you opt for Lightning Speed transfers, our bank partner will charge you a $2.99 fee to transfer your paycheck to your linked bank account on the same day your employer processes payroll, which may be up to 2 days before your scheduled payday. If you do not opt for Lightning Speed transfers, our bank partner will automatically transfer your paycheck to your linked bank account for free, by your regular payday. Early Pay is available to eligible EarnIn members in select states. Additional restrictions may apply. For more information, please refer to our FAQ.

To qualify for a Pay Period Max increase, your direct deposits must be at least $250 if you get paid weekly, $500 if you get paid biweekly or semi-monthly, or $1000 if you get paid monthly. Pay Period Max is subject to a $1000 limit per pay period. The amount may vary based on your income and risk factors. EarnIn may adjust it at its discretion.
4 Balance Shield provides free alerts when your bank account balance drops below the threshold you set in your EarnIn account. You can also enable automatic transfers ($100/day-subject to your available earnings-with a limit of $1,000/pay period), if your bank account balance falls below your set threshold. If your available earnings are insufficient to transfer the $100, the transfer will not be completed. You choose the speed of these automatic transfers. Standard speed is available at no cost and the transfer typically takes 1-2 business days. Lightning Speed is available for a fee [see Lightning Speed Fee Table] and the transfer typically takes less than 30 minutes. You will also have the option to set a tip for automatic transfers. Tips are optional and can be $0; however, if you choose to set a tip, it will be applied to each Balance Shield transfer. Whether you tip, how much, and how often you tip does not impact the quality and availability of services. You can cancel the alerts and/or transfers at any time in your EarnIn account settings. See the Cash Out User Agreement for more details. While Balance Shield can help you avoid overdrafts, it does not guarantee protection from third-party fees, and its effectiveness depends on your usage and bank activity.
5 Tip Yourself Account funds and Tip Jars are held with Evolve Bank & Trust, Member FDIC and FDIC insured up to $250,000. Tip Yourself is a 0% Annual Percentage Yield and $0 monthly fee service deposit account. For more information/details visit Evolve Bank & Trust Customer Account Terms. The FDIC provides deposit insurance to protect your money in the event of a bank failure. More details about deposit insurance here.

7 Your VantageScore 3.0 from Experian® indicates your credit risk level and is not used by all lenders, so don't be surprised if your lender uses a score that's different from your VantageScore 3.0. Learn more.
8 Tips go to EarnIn and help us provide tools such as Credit Monitoring for free and keep Lightning Speed fees low. Your service quality and availability aren't affected by whether you tip or not.
9 Lightning Speed is an optional service that allows you to expedite the transfer of funds for a fee. Depending on the product, the fee may be charged by EarnIn or its banking partner. Lightning Speed may not be available to all customers. Actual transfer speeds depend on your bank. See the Lightning Speed Fee Table for details.
