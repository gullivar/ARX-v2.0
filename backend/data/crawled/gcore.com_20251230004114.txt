Futureproof DDoS defense: dataforest’s partnership with Gcore

Businesses face a challenge: the rise in DDoS attacks using bandwidths of 1&nbsp;terabit per second (Tbps) and above means they must continuously improve their protection. The latest Gcore Radar Report provides compelling evidence that threats are increasing and attacks are becoming bigger and more frequent every day. dataforest GmbH, which specializes in repelling complex, large-scale DDoS attacks, saw this situation as an opportunity to expand its own capacity.Infrastructure expansion: migrating to modern technologiesIn mid-2023, dataforest began its migration to a new edge-routing concept and upgraded its key transit ports to cutting-edge 400G technology. The company’s partnership with Gcore was decisive in effecting this change. Equipping dataforest with multiple 400&nbsp;Gbps ports enables it to meet high bandwidth requirements while ensuring the optimum traffic mix, maximum redundancy, and outstanding reliability.We know we can always count on Gcore and see them as a reliable partner. The provision of 400G ports and the excellent cooperation between the two companies’ network departments allow dataforest to continue developing its proprietary zero-loss anti-DDoS solution autonomously. It also means that dataforest can offer customized protection solutions for a wide range of customer needs.– Tim Hochmann, CEO, dataforestInnovation with zero-loss DDoS protectiondataforest uses Gcore’s modern infrastructure to implement innovative zero-loss DDoS protection. This technology gives customers uninterrupted access to their services even under extreme loads. Behind it is a high-performance backbone with a capacity of several Tbps, which provides a stable and reliable foundation for demanding applications.Efficient support: flexibility and fast response timesGcore wins customers over with its technical stability and top-level support, which is characterized by exceptional flexibility and fast response times. In the event of performance losses, networks can often be optimized within just a few minutes using rapid analyses and targeted measures. This agility plays a decisive role in ensuring stability and allowing continuous adaptation to the requirements of dynamic scenarios.Customer focus: specific solutions for dataforestdataforest also saw Gcore’s ability to respond to its specific requirements as key to the collaboration. One example of this is the establishment of a dedicated point of presence&nbsp;(PoP) on the Interxion campus in Frankfurt, Germany. This PoP was built especially for dataforest and fine-tuned to fulfill the company’s particular performance requirements perfectly. Despite the technical complexity, commissioning went smoothly and without any need to compromise on bandwidth, flexibility, or efficiency.&nbsp;“The fact that our edge routing takes place in such a central location on the same campus meant that we could further reduce costs and latencies,” says Tim Lauderbach, who is responsible for the dataforest network. “Our customers therefore benefit from even better and cheaper premium traffic.”Technological synergies: collaborating on BGP FlowspecAnother example of the close collaboration between Gcore and dataforest was the successful implementation of BGP Flowspec. This technology makes it possible to automatically contain volumetric DDoS attacks at network edges within just a few seconds. Thanks to Gcore’s global network of over 180&nbsp;PoPs, attacks can be limited at the source, creating additional protection for both networks.

How ProSieben scaled Germany’s Next Top Model TOPSHOT for real-time AI portraits with Gcore

To celebrate the 20th season of Germany’s Next Top Model (GNTM), ProSieben’s marketing team launched GNTM TOPSHOT, an AI-powered feature in the Joyn app that instantly transforms user photos into studio-grade, show-inspired portraits.At broadcast scale, the challenge was steep: handle massive primetime spikes, deliver results instantly, and guarantee strict EU privacy compliance. To make it possible, ProSieben turned to Gcore Everywhere AI.“We needed something that could scale on demand, deliver in seconds, and keep data local. Gcore’s infrastructure let us bring a creative idea to life - without breaking the user experience.”- Simon Hawe, Technical Lead, JoynThe challenge: broadcast-scale creativity in real timeTOPSHOT had to satisfy five tough, non-negotiable requirements:Primetime surges. Usage surged before, during, and after live broadcasts across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.Ultra-low latency. Fans expected results within 5 - 10 seconds per portrait, end-to-end.Privacy by design. Joyn deletes all photos immediately to keep user data truly private - no caching, no storage. Caching wasn’t an option; every request had to be generated fresh.High fidelity. Each portrait required a ~100-stage pipeline for segmentation, relighting, skin/pose preservation, and compositing, to match GNTM’s signature aesthetic.Frictionless UX. No login required. The feature had to “just work,” even on mobile connections.Turning fans into models in real timeProSieben needed an inference platform that was scalable, privacy-compliant, and easy to integrate. Gcore Everywhere AI delivered:One endpoint, nearest node. Smart Routing automatically sent each request to the closest GPU endpoint, minimizing jitter and wait times.Autoscaling GPUs. Serverless orchestration spun GPU capacity up or down in real time, handling unpredictable primetime peaks.EU-ready deployments. Hybrid support (on-prem, Gcore Cloud, public cloud) gave ProSieben full flexibility on data residency.Optimized for image workloads. Everywhere AI ran TOPSHOT’s complex pipelines on NVIDIA H100, A100, and L40S GPUs - excellent for generative image models.“Our biggest challenge was combining visual fidelity with real-time response. Gcore’s Smart Routing and auto-scaling made that possible at primetime scale.”- Benjamin Risom, Chief Product Officer, JoynThe architecture allowed ProSieben to:Route all traffic through a single inference endpoint, fronted by their own load balancerKeep portrait generation under 10 seconds - even during broadcast surgesMeet strict privacy guarantees: no logins, no storage of inputs or outputsDeliver a seamless experience inside the Joyn appTOPSHOT went live with five portrait scenes in April 2025, with three more added weeks later.“We could focus on the creative, knowing the infrastructure would scale with us. That made it possible to deliver something really special for our viewers.”— Sebastian v. Wyschetzki, Creative Lead, Seven.One Entertainment GroupReal-time engagement, broadcast scaleTOPSHOT launched into a season already driving cultural buzz.The GNTM Season 20 finale (June 19, 2025) drew 3.87M viewers with a 22.4% share in the 14 - 49 demo.Joyn saw 10M viewers in April 2025 (+80% YoY) and a 40% increase in watch time in Q1 2025 YoY.TV Total host Sebastian Pufpaff demoed TOPSHOT live on air, praising the visuals and sparking organic uptake.Trade press highlighted the “scalable Gcore infrastructure” behind the feature.“Gcore’s platform gave us regional performance, privacy control, and GPU scaling without the heavy lifting of building and managing infrastructure ourselves.”— Paolo Garri, Infrastructure Architect, JoynWhat’s next?Building on TOPSHOT’s success, ProSieben is playing with new potential fan-facing AI experiences: video portraits, real-time filters, or stylized animations. With Gcore’s flexible infrastructure, the team is free to keep experimenting without re-architecting.“The success of TOPSHOT showed us what’s possible. Now we’re asking: how far can we take this?”— Jutta Meyer, Executive VP Marketing &amp; Creation, Seven.One Entertainment Group
