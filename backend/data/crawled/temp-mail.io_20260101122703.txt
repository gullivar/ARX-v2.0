Without using a real address, cluttering your personal inbox, or managing multiple test accounts manually.

With a throwaway email, you can access these perks without getting stuck in a long-term marketing funnel. If you're downloading a free eBook, template, or plugin, there's no need to give your real email and risk being spammed for months.
