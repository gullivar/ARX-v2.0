ABOUT Hitachi Energy is a global technology company specializing in providing advanced energy solutions and services. USE CASE Hitachi Energy's global services needed a centralized solution that enabled compliance through last-mile software supply chain security. Jeremy Morgan from Hitachi Energy shares how OPSWAT's MetaDefender Core and MetaDefender K2100 Mobile Kiosks transformed their approach to supply chain cybersecurity. PRODUCTS USED: MetaDefender Core MetaDefender K2100 Mobile Kiosks ABOUT Ivanti specializes in IT management, security, and automation software solutions.

PRODUCTS USED: OESIS Framework ABOUT HiBob is a global, cloud-native, human resources tech company with an application responsible for managing the entire employee lifecycle—onboarding, time and attendance, compensation, performance review, tasks, and offboarding. USE CASE HiBob established a hiring model called 'Bob Hiring,' allowing external candidates to submit applications via a portal. This raised concerns about file sanitization and data integrity. They needed a solution that integrated seamlessly with their AWS S3 cloud infrastructure.

By implementing OPSWAT MetaDefender solutions, they revolutionized their file security, to detect and remove potential threats and expedite the validation process. PRODUCTS USED: MetaDefender Core , MetaDefender Kiosk , MetaDefender Drive , and MetaDefender Managed File Transfer (MFT) . ABOUT Genesis Energy, one of New Zealand’s largest electricity and natural gas providers, powers homes and businesses through a diverse mix of thermal, hydro, wind, solar, and battery assets—including the 240 MW Tokaanu Power Station—while driving the country’s shift to sustainable energy.
