"Today's groundbreaking experiment (we are charging professionals haha) So, are you ready for this, using the EcoFlow River Plus to charge our E-bike, while the solar hat heroically recharges the River 3 Plus. Is it efficient? No. Is it necessary? Absolutely not. But the sun’s out, and science must be done!"

"Well in less than 6 months I think I've definitely became obsessed with the solar and battery life hahaha found the perfect mobile shelf for the dp3's and now looking into which ev charger to buy"
John Northrop
"With the rumored Wave 3 on the horizon, was hoping that its EB has the very same dimension as the W2 extra batt so we could buy it for that LFP longetivity and hoping it would now be compatible with D2M as extra batt OR.. Just wait for the d2m extra batt to cut its price some more Wishful thinking but, Cheers! "
