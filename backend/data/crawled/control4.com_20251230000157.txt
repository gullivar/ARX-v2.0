THE BENEFITS ARE BUILT IN

Collaborating with a certified integrator allows you to personalize your space to reflect your unique lifestyle. You can easily update playlists, adjust scenes, and modify lighting. As your needs change, your Control4 system will adapt, allowing you to create a home or business space that suits your needs.

Customizable Systems

Your custom smart system is designed around your current needs while remaining flexible to scale for future growth. Your integrator will help you create scenes, set up automations and manage schedules based on your preferences, plus assist with any updates and adjustments.

Total Control

Keep your smart system at your fingertips with the Control4 app. You'll get push notifications, remote access, at-a-glance info, and control for your devices, all from your phone, tablet, touchscreen, or smart remote.

Professional Integrators

Our certified integration professionals ensure your project is correctly installed, reliable, scalable, and personalized to your life for a seamless, smart experience. They'll be there every step of the way, including service and support post-install.

WORKS  WITH CONTROL4

Your system will work with thousands of Control4 and third-party products to transform your favorite devices into one cohesive smart home system. Manage them all with a simple tap, a single voice command, or even allow things to happen automatically with no interaction at all.

Our professional integrators offer tailored solutions to perfectly match your needs.

“Our house always has music playing and we love it. The system is so easy to use that even my five-year-old can select in which rooms she would like to hear music.”

Chris B, Control4 Homeowner

“I have used Control 4 since 2009 and have it in several homes and businesses. The ease and adaptability of the system is great. I wouldn't use anything else.”

John S, Control4 Homeowner

“It's the go-to control system to integrate just about everything in my house and for automating repetitive tasks. Coupled with amazing media control, it's a no-brainer.”

Chris A, Control4 Homeowner

“The interface is SIMPLE and it's the same experience whether you use the Pad, the remote, or the app on a smart phone!”

Jeremiah W, Control4 Homeowner

“Control4 is one of those things you don't know that you need until you have it. I love the utility of it, having 'settings' in certain rooms & from a security standpoint it's an integral part of our house.”

Joe P, Control4 Homeowner

“We control all of our televisions and sound system either from our phones or the handheld remotes, no matter where we are in the house. It is heaven. It has made our hectic lives that much easier.”

Susan G, Control4 Homeowner
