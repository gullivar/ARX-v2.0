Surabhi Srivastava

Surabhi explores how media can be a lever to drive social impact at RNW Media in the Netherlands. She is focused on the intersection of media and AI ethics. She wants real impact for her community, where "diverse groups of people have a voice, and the decision-making power to co-design and co-create tech that serves public interest."
