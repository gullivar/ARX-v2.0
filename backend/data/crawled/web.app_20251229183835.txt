Fast and secure, out of the box

Deliver your content securely with built-in zero-configuration SSL certificates. Files are cached at CDN edges around the world, and served as gzip or Brotli for the smallest, best-compressed version of your content, based on what your user's client is able to handle.

Preview and share changes

Deploy to a shareable, temporary preview channel to preview your site with your team before going live.

Multiple frameworks, one command

Build static websites with popular frameworks like React, Vite, Vue and more. Deploy with a single command using the Firebase CLI: firebase deploy.

Start now, and pay as you go

Get started with 10 GB of storage and up to 360 MB/day of data transfer, free of charge. Custom domain, global CDN, and SSL certificate included.
