Important The Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (“IP Captioned Telephone Service” or “Captioning”) is available only to individuals who have a medically recognized hearing loss necessitating their use of the captioning service. The IP Captioned Telephone Service is supported through the Federal Interstate TRS Fund. All calls either made or received from a ClearCaptions Endpoint must include a hearing-impaired person who needs captions to fully utilize the telephone. If a non-hard-of-hearing person uses your ClearCaptions Endpoint or if the user does not need captions to fully utilize the telephone, captioning must be turned off. (See User Guide for directions.) A non-hard-of-hearing person may not use the ClearCaptions Endpoint to make or receive phone calls with Captions on or enabled. Only individuals, including you, who have registered and completed a Self-Certification Form with ClearCaptions may use your ClearCaptions Endpoint with Captions on or enabled. Failure to provide correct information when you register for ClearCaptions or use the IP Captioned Telephone Service can lead to termination of your Service and possible prosecution. This Agreement is between ClearCaptions LLC (referred to herein with its agents affiliates, subsidiaries and licensors as “ClearCaptions”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or the “Company”) and you, the user of the Service (you are referred to herein as either “you”, “your”, or as the “User”). By activating or using the Service or any part thereof in any way, or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this Agreement, you agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the terms related to 911 emergency services as described in Section 6. The Company provides IP Captioned Telephone Service. The Service provides near real-time call captions of phone conversations for English and Bilingual (English/Spanish) individuals who have hearing loss that necessitates the use of the IP Captioned Telephone Service. The Service may employ a communications assistant who, with the aid of speech recognition software, converts the other party’s spoken words into captioned text in an otherwise standard voice telephone environment. The Service also may employ speech recognition software alone, without a communications assistant. The basic specifications and functionality of the Service are further described on the Company’s website. The Company offers enabled Endpoints to access Captioning. Before using the Products or IP Captioned Telephone Services, you must complete a Registration Form and a Self-Certification form on which you certify under penalty of perjury, that (i) You have a hearing loss that necessitates the use of the IP Captioned Telephone Service; (ii) You understand that captioning may be provided by a live communications assistant who listens to the other party on the line and provides the text displayed on your phone or other Endpoints; (iii) You understand that the cost of the ClearCaptions calls is funded by the TRS Fund; and (iv) You will not permit persons who have not registered to use ClearCaptions captioned telephone service to make or receive captioned telephone calls using your registered IP Captioned Telephone Service or Endpoints (“Self-Certification Form”). As of this date, ClearCaptions only offers the Self-Certification Form in English. 1. DEFINITIONS AND DEFINED TERMS.

If a ClearCaptions Mobile Application customer deletes their Application, all stored voicemails will be lost. We are not liable for missed or deleted voicemails or other messages that gets lost or are delayed in delivery or for partial or total non-performance of any voicemail service. [Reserved] Government-Mandated Taxes, Fees and Surcharges and Elective Fees . The VoIP provider ClearCaptions obtains 10-digit phone numbers from may be assessed fees associated with contributions to the Universal Service Fund (“USF”) or other regulatory fees and government-mandated taxes, fees and surcharges including 911 surcharges. Additionally, the VoIP provider may impose elective fees on ClearCaptions associated with obtaining a 10-digit phone number and the services to support interconnecting the 10-digit phone number with the public telephone network. We reserve the right to recover (i) government mandated taxes, fees and surcharges that a VoIP provider imposes on ClearCaptions or directly imposed on ClearCaptions by a governmental or regulatory authority; (ii) any elective fees that a VoIP provider imposes on ClearCaptions; (iii) any fees as identified in Section 5(d) above; or (iv) any combination of the preceding, and, in each case, directly from you by billing you these charges consistent with relevant law. Should we choose to execute that right, you will be provided prior notice before any such charges are billed and/or collected except for recurring charges where you will receive notice prior to our imposition of the first recurring charge but not on each recurring charge thereafter. You can cancel your service at any time, with no charge, but if you fail to cancel after receiving prior notice of such charges, you agree to pay any charges imposed by us. Geographic Number.

DIALING 911 FROM A TTY OR TRADITIONAL PHONE REMAINS THE MOST RELIABLE AND FASTEST METHOD OF REACHING EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL. 911 CALLING USING THE SERVICES OR THE CLEARCAPTIONS PRODUCTS DIFFERS IN IMPORTANT WAYS FROM PLACING 911 CALLS FROM TRADITIONAL WIRELINE TELEPHONE OR TTY SERVICES. THIS SECTION PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS: GENERAL LIMITATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE SERVICES AND ALL CLEARCAPTIONS PRODUCTS: PLACING A 911 CALL USING THE SERVICES AND A CLEARCAPTIONS PRODUCT IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LIMITATIONS (A) WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT A CONNECTION WILL BE ESTABLISHED ENABLING THE PLACING OF EMERGENCY CALLS; (B) YOU NEED TO PROVIDE LOCATION OR OTHER INFORMATION TO CLEARCAPTIONS AND UPDATE THIS INFORMATION WHEN YOU CHANGE LOCATIONS FOR YOUR 911 SERVICE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY (C) 911 CALLING WILL NOT BE FUNCTIONAL IF YOUR BROADBAND CONNECTION IS NOT FUNCTIONAL FOR ANY REASON OR ANY OF YOUR ENDPOINTS CANNOT ACCESS A BROADBAND INTERNET CONNECTION AT THE TIME THE CALL IS ATTEMPTED; (D) 911 CALLING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IF THERE IS A POWER OUTAGE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR BROADBAND CONNECTION OR YOUR ENDPOINTS; (E) 911 CALLING WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IF YOUR SERVICES ARE CANCELLED, TERMINATED OR SUSPENDED BY CLEARCAPTIONS FOR ANY REASON; (F) YOUR 911 CALL MAY BE DELAYED OR NOT TRANSMITTED AS RAPIDLY AS THOSE TRANSMITTED USING A TRADITIONAL WIRELINE PHONE OR TTY SERVICE; (G) IF A CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED, SUCH CONNECTION MAY NOT BE TO THE GEOGRAPHICALLY APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (H) 911 CALLS MAY BE INCORRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE CALL CENTER’S ADMINISTRATIVE LINE, WHICH MAY NOT BE STAFFED AFTER HOURS OR BY TRAINED 911 OPERATORS ; (I) IF A CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED, YOUR ACTUAL LOCATION INFORMATION MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE EMERGENCY CALL TAKER; (J) IF A CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED, THE INCORRECT ADDRESS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDED TO THE EMERGENCY CALL TAKER; (K) IF A CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED, IP CAPTIONED TELEPHONE SERVICES MAY SLOW THE RESPONSE TIME OR THE RELAY OF EMERGENCY INFORMATION; (L) THE EMERGENCY CALL TAKER MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO RECEIVE EITHER REGISTERED 911 LOCATION (AS DEFINED BELOW) INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT OR AUTOMATIC LOCATION INFORMATION WHEN USING THE CLEARCAPTIONS PRODUCTS; (M) THE EMERGENCY CALL TAKER MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO REACH YOU ON THE ENDPOINT YOU USED TO DIAL 911 BECAUSE THE CLEARCAPTIONS TELEPHONE NUMBER COULD RING ALL OF YOUR CLEARCAPTIONS’ ENDPOINTS AT THE SAME TIME AND (N) IF YOUR ENDPOINTS USED TO PLACE 911 CALLS MALFUNCTION FOR ANY REASON, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PLACE 911 CALLS, YOUR REGISTERED 911 LOCATION (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR AUTOMATIC LOCATION INFORMATION MAY NOT TRANSMIT OR YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A CALL BACK FROM AN EMERGENCY CALL TAKER. User-Provided Registered 911 Location . To ensure your 911 call is routed to the proper Emergency Response Center and to ensure that the emergency response personnel can send help to your physical location in any of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, ClearCaptions needs to obtain the address from which you are placing the emergency call (“Registered 911 Location”). You are responsible for providing ClearCaptions an up-to-date Registered 911 Location. If you fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain your location information and route your call to the appropriate Emergency Response Center or provide your physical location. If you change your Registered 911 Location, you must update ClearCaptions with your new Registered 911 Location. If ClearCaptions is not able to validate the new Registered 911 Location, you will not be able to submit the provided address and it could take as long as up to several business days to activate 911 service at the provided address. If a 911 emergency call is made prior to activation, then your call and the Registered 911 Location information may not be automatically routed to the appropriate Emergency Response Center. You can inform ClearCaptions of your initial or new Registered 911 Location by calling 1 (866) 868-8695. You can also update your Registered 911 Location directly through either the ClearCaptions Mobile Application or directly through your ClearCaptions Phone. Single-number Feature may Interfere with 911 Call-back . ClearCaptions uses a single-number feature for the ClearCaptions Telephone Number associated with your Endpoints. The single-number feature is designed to ring on multiple Endpoints simultaneously, provided that such Endpoints are associated with your Service. Emergency personnel may not be able to reach you if one of your other Endpoints (that is utilizing the single-number feature) is answered prior to you answering the device from where the 911 call was placed. 911 Available Only in the U.S . Emergency calling functionality as described in this Section 6 for all ClearCaptions Products is available only for calls placed from a location in any of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. 911 Mobile Calling . By using the ClearCaptions Mobile Phone or the ClearCaptions Mobile Application on a mobile platform, or any part thereof in any way, you grant us permission to share your location with emergency response personnel. Your location may be automatically detected when you use the ClearCaptions Mobile Phone or your mobile platform is running the ClearCaptions Mobile Application and we may transmit that information to Emergency Response Center or we may transmit your Registered 911 Location information. We cannot know with certainty which location will be transmitted with such calls. We will attempt to route your call to the geographically appropriate Emergency Response Center based on your location information but if we rely on your Registered 911 Location and that is different than your actual location, your 911 call may be routed to the incorrect Emergency Response Center. It is also possible that your call may be routed to an Emergency Call Center. Such center will only have access to your Registered 911 Location which may not be your actual location and may not have access to your call-back telephone number. Additionally, such Emergency Call Centers will not be the geographically appropriate Emergency Response Center that will likely result in the delay of dispatching emergency first responders. Mobile Device Location Setting . Your location can only be detected when your device location setting is enabled. This allows us to determine your devices’ location using a combination of global positioning service (GPS), nearby wireless access points, cell towers, and/or your IP address. Depending on the capabilities of your device, the capabilities of the underlying wireline or wireless networks, and/or the Emergency Response Center, your device’s automatic location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy. NOTE THAT EVEN IF THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS ENABLED, WE MAY STILL ROUTE YOUR CALL BASED ON THE REGISTERED 911 LOCATION FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. Wi-Fi Only Mobile Devices. AUTOMATIC LOCATION INFORMATION MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN USING SUCH DEVICES OR THE LOCATION INFORMATION TRANSMITTED MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WI-FI ACCESS POINT RATHER THAN YOUR ACTUAL DEVICE. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LOCATION INFORMATION IS UNAVAILABLE WE WILL ONLY USE YOUR REGISTERED 911 LOCATION FOR ROUTING 911 CALLS AND FOR PROVIDING AUTOMATIC LOCATION INFORMATION TO EMERGENCY CALL TAKERS. Emergency Call Center. ClearCaptions reserves the right to route a 911 call to an Emergency Call Center when it cannot validate location information. An Emergency Call Center may require you to provide your current location orally to determine the geographically appropriate Emergency Response Center. You acknowledge and agree that ClearCaptions, when providing access to emergency communications services through any of ClearCaptions Products or Services, intends to limit its liability and immunize ClearCaptions from all liability of the same scope and extent that is equivalent to the scope and extent of immunity or other protection from liability afforded any local exchange carriers under federal and applicable state law (whether through statute, judicial decision, tariffs filed or posted by local exchange carriers, or otherwise). 7. TRANSMISSION OF FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA) EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM ClearCaptions offers Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Emergency Alert System (EAS) in certain geographic areas, on emergency alert capable devices, including ClearCaptions Phone and certain Endpoints. You may receive emergency alerts from FEMA and information on how to contact FEMA for more information. It is up to you to decide whether or not to contact FEMA for more information. When messages are transmitted, your Service may be interrupted and the message may be repeated twice. FEMA and ClearCaptions may also conduct EAS tests that may interrupt Service. If you use ClearCaptions’ single-number feature, the emergency alert may be transmitted on multiple Endpoints simultaneously. This service is available only in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Your User-Provided Registered 911 Location will be used to deliver emergency alerts that are relevant for your geographic location. In the event ClearCaptions does not have a User’s Registered 911 Location, ClearCaptions will use the User’s address provided in their Registration Form. You are responsible for providing ClearCaptions an up-to-date address if it changes from the Registration Form. Emergency alerts may not be available on all devices or in all geographic areas. In areas in which the emergency alerts are transmitted, such alerts may not be received by you even though you have a ClearCaptions Phone or Endpoint capable of receiving them. There is no additional charge for these emergency alerts. For details on the availability of this service and emergency alert capable devices, please ask a sales representative, or visit FEMA’s EAS web page for more information at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/emergency-alert-system . In transmitting emergency alerts pursuant to federal law, ClearCaptions, including its contractors and affiliates, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns, shall not be liable to any subscriber to, or user of, ClearCaptions’ Phone or Endpoints for any act or omission related to or any harm resulting from the transmission of, or the failure to transmit, an emergency alert; or the release to a government entity or agency, public safety, fire service, law enforcement official, emergency medical service, or emergency facility of subscriber information used in connection with delivering an emergency alert. 8. GENERAL DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. ALL SERVICES, CLEARCAPTIONS PRODUCTS AND CLEARCAPTIONS SYSTEMS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND CLEARCAPTIONS HEREBY DISCLAIMS, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 9 OF THIS AGREEMENT, ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHER, AND CLEARCAPTIONS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, CLEARCAPTIONS MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 911 OR OTHER EMERGENCY CALLING OR CALL-BACK FUNCTIONALITY, OR EAS, OR CLEARCAPTIONS’ MATERIALS, OR ANY PRODUCTS OR RESULTS OF THE USE THEREOF, WILL MEET USER’S OR ANY OTHER PERSON’S REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY SOFTWARE, SYSTEM OR OTHER SERVICES BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE OR ERROR FREE. ALL THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF OR CONCERNING ANY THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS IS STRICTLY BETWEEN USER AND THE THIRD-PARTY OWNER OR DISTRIBUTOR OF THE THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS. NO EMPLOYEE, AGENT, DEALER OR DISTRIBUTOR IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, OR TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES. IF WE CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES THEN TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD OF THIRTY (30) DAYS OR SUCH LONGER PERIOD IF REQUIRED BY RELEVANT LAW AND SHALL BE SUBJECT ONLY TO THE LIMITED REMEDIES REQUIRED BY RELEVANT LAW. THE SERVICES ARE BASED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDED FOR ACCESS AND USE ONLY BY PERSONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OR SOME OF THE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND THAT ACCESS THERETO MAY NOT BE LEGAL BY CERTAIN PERSONS OR IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. IF YOU ACCESS THE SERVICES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ALL LOCAL LAWS. 9. SATISFACTION GUARANTY AND LIMITED WARRANTY. We have complete confidence in the quality of the ClearCaptions Products and firmly believe that you will be more than delighted. However, we understand that sometimes things may not go as planned. That is why we offer limited remedies for ClearCaptions’ Products. For more information see the Limited Remedies in Section 13. Limited Warranty for ClearCaptions Phones . We warrant that for a period of one (1) year (“Warranty Period”) after delivery of the ClearCaptions Phone to you, and under normal use by the original end-user purchaser, that the ClearCaptions Phone shall be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, provided that ClearCaptions reserves the right to exclusively determine how to repair any defective phones during the Warranty Period which may include repair or replacement of the ClearCaptions Phone with a new or refurbished device. In the event there are FCC regulations which prevent ClearCaptions from issuing you a replacement ClearCaptions Phone, ClearCaptions may provide you with a different ClearCaptions model as a replacement. Scope of Limited Warranty for ClearCaptions Phones . This warranty applies only to defects in factory materials and factory workmanship. Any condition caused by accident, abuse, misuse or improper operation, violation of instructions furnished by ClearCaptions, destruction or alteration, improper electrical voltages or currents, or repair or maintenance attempted by anyone other than ClearCaptions or an authorized service center, is not a defect covered by this warranty. Telephone companies manufacture different types of equipment and ClearCaptions does not warrant that its equipment is compatible with the equipment of a particular phone company. This limited warranty applies only to the ClearCaptions Phone and not to any third-party products, even if the product is sold with or packaged with ClearCaptions branded products. In so far as permitted by law, the ClearCaptions Phone is provided “as is”. In the case of any inconsistencies between the phone warranty found in the box and this limited warranty, this limited warranty will control. We may update this limited warranty at any time, and we will post such updates. Using the ClearCaptions Phone after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the ClearCaptions Phone. 10.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE COLLECTIVE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CLEARCAPTIONS AND ITS AGENTS, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACTORS, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER, UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY AND OTHERWISE, EXCEED SIX (6) MONTHS OF THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES.

If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with the ClearCaptions Products, you may request a refund of amounts you actually paid (if any) for your ClearCaptions Phone (“Returned Product”) by notifying us in writing or by calling ClearCaptions’ Customer Support group within sixty (60) days from the date of delivery (“Refund Period”), which notice must provide the following: (a) your name; (b)   contact information; (c) the reason for the request for a refund; and (d) the serial number for the Returned Product. The date of delivery will be the date a ClearCaptions employee or contractor delivers and installs the ClearCaptions Phone or, in the case of shipping, five days after the ClearCaptions Phone is shipped to you. In order to receive the refund, you first must return the ClearCaptions Phone, undamaged and in good condition. The refund will only be issued once ClearCaptions receives the Phone. Upon refund of your payment (if any) for the Returned Product, you acknowledge and agree that this Agreement will be deemed to have automatically terminated as applied to the Returned Product. Replacement Phone .

Our entire liability and your exclusive remedy with respect to the ClearCaptions Phone warranty shall be: the repair or replacement of any non-conforming ClearCaptions Phone not meeting our Limited Warranty which is returned to our customer support department within the Warranty Period; and we may replace any non-conforming ClearCaptions Phone with a new or refurbished ClearCaptions Phone similar in functionality or user capabilities, the selection of which replacement ClearCaptions Phone to issue will be at our discretion and based upon our available ClearCaptions Phone replacement inventory. In the event there are FCC regulations which prevent ClearCaptions from issuing you a replacement ClearCaptions Phone, ClearCaptions may provide you with a different ClearCaptions model as a replacement. The replacement ClearCaptions Phone or replacement part(s) are subject to the remaining warranty term for the original ClearCaptions Phone. The original ClearCaptions Phone, as well as any replacement ClearCaptions Phone or parts, will remain our property. Any repairs attempted or made to the ClearCaptions Phone by someone other than us may void all applicable ClearCaptions Phone warranties. Termination of Service. If we are unable to repair or deliver a replacement ClearCaptions Phone that is free of defects in materials or workmanship, you may terminate this Agreement by returning the ClearCaptions Phone and the Services will be terminated so long as the account holder does not possess a second ClearCaptions Phone or Application. Any Services terminated pursuant to this section will result in ClearCaptions reclaiming the ClearCaptions Telephone Number and the ClearCaptions Telephone Number assigned by the company for your use with the Services will no longer be associated with you or your account. 14.

In the course of providing our IP Captioned Telephone Services to you through an Endpoint, we collect and maintain certain customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”) in accordance with the rules and regulations of the FCC and any applicable requirements of the CCPA/CPRA/DOPPA when necessary. CPNI includes information which relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of the IP CTS services. Your telephone number, name, email address, and address are not CPNI. We value our relationships with our Users and are committed to respecting and protecting your CPNI. Accordingly, we have developed safeguards for the use of your CPNI. ClearCaptions may use or disclose your CPNI without further authorization from you under the following circumstances: To provide you with captioned relay services and phones; To process 911 calls; For installation, maintenance and repair of our products and services, including through the help of third parties; To offer you additional caption features and services of the type you already registered for with ClearCaptions; In response to legal requirements such as subpoena or court order; Upon request from the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) Telecommunications Relay Service (“TRS”) Fund, and for TRS program administration purposes; and To prevent fraud, abuse, or misuse of the service(s) and to protect the rights and property of ClearCaptions. We may use or disclose your CPNI to third parties to offer you products and services that may be different from the types of services you already use. We ask for your consent to do this during your registration process. At any time you may choose to opt out of this use of your CPNI for marketing purposes. You have the right to deny any TRS provider the right to use, disclose or permit access to your CPNI for certain marketing purposes, and TRS providers have a duty under federal law to honor your right to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. If you wish to restrict our use of your CPNI for marketing purposes, you may do the following: Log in at portal.clearcaptions.com go to the ‘CPNI Opt In’ section of your user profile (My Account), and uncheck the CPNI Opt-in checkbox; or On the ClearCaptions Phone (excluding the Ensemble) navigate to the ‘My Account’ section in Settings, log in, and unchecking or toggling off CPNI from the CPNI section. Call ClearCaptions Customer Support at 1 (866) 868-8695. Your approval or denial of our use of your CPNI for marketing purposes will not affect the provision of IP Captioned Telephone Services to you; however, the lack of access to your CPNI may prohibit ClearCaptions and its affiliates or authorized companies from offering you new or different services that may be of interest to you and tailored to your needs. Your approval or denial of our use of your CPNI for marketing purposes will stay in place until you change it. 18. TERM AND TERMINATION. This Agreement takes effect upon your operation of the ClearCaptions Products or Services and remains effective until termination of the same. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by returning to us the ClearCaptions Phone and destroying all copies of the Firmware and Documentation in your possession (if not returned with the ClearCaptions Phone) or by uninstalling the ClearCaptions Application.

WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY. No waiver by us of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of us to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. 21. FORCE MAJEURE. In no event will ClearCaptions be liable or responsible to you, or be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement, (except for any payment obligation), when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond ClearCaptions’ reasonable control (a “Force Majeure Event”), including acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake or explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this Agreement, national or regional emergency, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo, export or import restriction, quota or other restriction or prohibition or any complete or partial government shutdown, or national or regional shortage of adequate power or telecommunications or transportation. 22.

Based on the legal requirements applicable to your jurisdiction, and subject to any legal restrictions or exceptions, you may have the choices and rights described below. Right to Access. You may request access to the personal information we hold about you. This may include the right to be informed about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected, the sources from which we collected it, the purposes for collecting it, and the third parties with whom we have shared it. Right to Correct . You may request that we correct any inaccurate personal information relating to you without undue delay. In this context, taking into account the purposes of the processing, you may also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal information. Right to Delete . You may request the deletion of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions. In certain circumstances, it may not be possible for us to accept your request, for example, when the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, or if the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. Right to Portability . You may request that we provide you with a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer this information to another data controller, where technically feasible. Right to Opt Out of Sale. You may direct us not to sell or share your personal information with third parties. Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising . You may request that we not disclose, disseminate, or transfer your personal information to a third party for targeted advertising (also known as “cross-context behavioral advertising”).

You may request that we restrict processing of your personal information. In certain circumstances, it may not be possible for us to accept your request, for example, when the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, or if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds otherwise. Right to Opt Out of Certain Data Processing . You may withdraw your consent that you have previously provided for ClearCaptions’ collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, subject to reasonable notice and any contractual or legal exceptions. Note that this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing of your personal information based on consent before its withdrawal. Right to Opt Out of Automated Individual Decision-Making . You may have the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. Note that this right shall not apply if such a decision is necessary as part of a contract we have with or want to conclude with you, we have your consent, or we are permitted by law to engage in such automated decision making. In these cases, we will implement measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, and you may contest the decision by contacting us as set forth below. Right Against Discrimination. You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of your data protection rights. This means that we will not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services based solely on your exercise of these rights. Right to Appeal. Depending on your residency, you may have the right to appeal if we decline to act regarding your privacy request. To do so, please follow the instructions for exercising your privacy rights below, or use the contact information provided in this Policy. Residents of California may also have additional rights pertaining to their personal information, as described in "California Privacy Rights.” 8.2. Exercising Your Privacy Rights To exercise any of the rights outlined above, please visit our web form . To ensure the security and confidentiality of your personal information, we have established verification measures that must be completed prior to fulfilling certain requests to exercise your data rights. These measures may involve confirming your identity through a series of questions or requiring documentation that substantiates your identity or authority to make the request. Should we be unable to verify your identity or authority adequately, we reserve the right to decline the request and will provide an explanation for our decision. Upon receiving a verified request to exercise your data rights, where applicable, we will acknowledge receipt of the request. We will aim to respond substantively to your request within time permitted under the applicable law. If we require more time to process your request, we will inform you of the reason and extend the period by the notified number of days. Please note that not all requests will be granted. Certain legal exceptions may apply, such as if we are unable to verify your identity, or if there are legal or contractual reasons that prevent us from fulfilling a deletion request. Regardless of the outcome, you will receive a written response that either details the actions we took or explains why no action was possible. If you are dissatisfied with our initial response, you may seek further review. To initiate an appeal, please contact us within 30 days of receiving our initial response using the method provided in the response.

SECURITY We implement recognized physical, technical, and organizational safeguards tailored to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data we collect and process. These safeguards are designed to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of personal data. However, despite our best efforts, no security measures can provide absolute protection against all security threats, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access or loss will never occur. We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify the appropriate person and/or any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so. 10. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY Our websites are not directed to children and are intended for use by individuals who have reached the age of majority in their jurisdiction, or the age of digital consent where applicable. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without the appropriate consent required by law. We may offer certain services that can be used by children. In those cases, a parent or legal guardian must provide any required consent before a child may use the service. We collect, use, and disclose a child’s information only as permitted by applicable law, including any limits on targeted advertising, profiling, and data sharing. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected personal information from your child without the required consent, contact us at compliance@clearcaptions.com . We will take reasonable steps to verify your request and delete the information unless we are required to retain it for legal, safety, or security reasons. California residents: we do not sell or share personal information of consumers under 16 years of age without the required opt in. United States residents: when a service is intended for use by children under 13, we obtain verifiable parental consent consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. 11.

Any modifications will be effective upon the date specified in the updated Policy. If we make material changes to this Policy that significantly affect your rights or the way we use your personal information, we will notify you through the most appropriate channels.

However, other notification methods may include sending an email to the address you have provided, posting a notice on our Services, or other methods as required by law.

We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting your personal information. 12. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS This section is tailored to meet the specific requirements imposed by California law. While this section outlines state-specific rights for California residents, the preceding sections of this Policy also apply to them. 12.1.

Notice of Financial Incentive . We may offer our customers loyalty and other incentive programs that provide certain benefits, such as rewards and exclusive offers. We may also provide other promotional campaigns, such as sweepstakes, contests, or limited-time promotions (collectively, the “Programs”). When you sign up for one of these Programs, we typically ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and/or telephone number). Because our Programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under the CCPA. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable Program, less the expense related to offering those products, services, and benefits to Program participants. Participation in a Program is governed by the applicable terms and conditions (including the Official Rules for any sweepstakes or contest or the promotional terms for any short-term promotion), which will also describe the financial incentives associated with the promotion and how to participate. You are not obligated to participate in any contest, sweepstakes, or short-term promotion and may terminate your participation at any time (as described in the Program terms and conditions). You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program terms and conditions. Shine the Light Disclosure . California Civil Code Section § 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, permits California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed. To make such a request, please send an email with the subject “Shine the Light Request” to the email address in our Contact Information. 12.2. California-specific Privacy Rights California law grants specific rights to California consumers regarding their personal information. Note that these may be duplicative of the rights described above in “Your Privacy Rights”. They are as follows: Right to Know . You can request, up to two times each year, that we disclose the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information that we collect, use, disclose, and may sell, the sources from which we collected it, the purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing it, as applicable, and the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed it. Right to Correction of Personal Information . You have the right to have inaccurate personal information corrected. Right to Deletion of Personal Information . You can ask us to delete the personal information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions such as to complete a transaction for you, to exercise our rights, or to comply with a legal obligation. Right to Opt out of Sales of Personal Information . You have the right opt out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. In the preceding twelve (12) months, ClearCaptions has not “sold” personal information as this term is defined in the CCPA. Therefore, we do not offer such a right. Right to Opt Out of Sharing of Personal Information . The CCPA defines “sharing” as disclosing or making a consumer’s personal information available to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising. In the preceding twelve (12) months, ClearCaptions has shared certain categories of personal information (identified in the above table) with third-party advertisers to tailor ads to consumers’ interests. You have the right to opt out of your personal information being shared for targeted advertising, and you may exercise this right by clicking “Cookie Settings” in the website footer and opting out of Targeted Advertising Cookies. Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information . You have the right to direct us to limit our use of your sensitive personal information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer. ClearCaptions does not use sensitive personal information beyond the CCPA’s permissible purposes. Right against Discrimination . You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from retaliation as prohibited by the CCPA. Right to Appeal . If we deny your request to exercise a right, you have the right to appeal our decision. To exercise your California privacy rights, please visit this web form or use the contact methods described below. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and your rights. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period (if properly submitted) and in accordance with applicable law. If we need more time to verify your identity, process and respond to your request, we will notify you of that fact along with the reason for the delay. If we decline to act regarding your request, we will inform you of our decision and the reason for it, and, if applicable, with instructions on how you may appeal our decision. You have the option to designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf for exercising your data rights. An authorized agent can be either a person or a business entity that you have formally authorized to act on your behalf. To use an authorized agent: Signed Authorization : You must provide the authorized agent with a signed written authorization to act on your behalf. This document should clearly indicate that you grant them the authority to submit requests for you. Agent Submission : The authorized agent can then submit a request via the methods outlined above. The agent should attach a copy of the written authorization you provided. Identity Verification : We may contact you directly to confirm that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf. This is a security measure designed to protect your personal information. Please note that we reserve the right to deny requests from agents who do not provide proof of authorization or if we cannot verify the agent’s identity. 13.
