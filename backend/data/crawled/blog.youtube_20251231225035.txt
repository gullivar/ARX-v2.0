In fact, viewers watched over 700 million hours of podcasts on living room devices in October 2025 , up from 400 million hours from just a year prior. To support this shift to the big screen, we updated the living room interface with the Creator Shows experience to help you find your next binge-worthy podcast. We also announced 1 billion monthly active podcast viewers and launched a Podcast chart in the US to celebrate your top podcasts and make it easier to discover your next favorite. If video is the new way to listen, then YouTube is the best place for podcasts. As we develop more ways to enjoy podcasts on YouTube next year, keep checking out youtube.com/podcasts for even more podcasts to enjoy.
