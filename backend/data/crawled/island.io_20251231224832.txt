BYOD Workforce Bring-your-own-device is a dream for end users, but a nightmare for security teams. The Enterprise Browser delivers the ideal work environment—full flexibility and total data protection. 3rd Party Onboarding Full granular control and visibility for you. Complete security for your data. Simple, native access for contractors. All with the Enterprise Browser. SaaS and Web Apps SaaS and web apps gave us unprecedented flexibility, but took away control over our own data. The Enterprise Browser gives you both. Privileged User Access Eliminate human error and insider threats by adding a layer of visibility and control to any admin interaction. All without writing a single line of source code. Zero Trust Imagine your zero trust architecture powered by the browser itself. Safe Browsing The Enterprise Browser naturally protects organizations from the full scope of web threats, without distracting, delaying, or intruding on users. Say Yes at Work Give your users the ability to use the tools, apps, and services they work with best, so they can innovate freely without opening the door to risk.
