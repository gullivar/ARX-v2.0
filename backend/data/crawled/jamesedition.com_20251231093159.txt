I joined JamesEdition as a way to market to buyers that were previously out of reach. For us, this platform works as an outlet where we can meet a relevant global audience. Having used it for years myself, I personally have seen the reach – from a consumer standpoint – and decided it was what our current and future buyers and sellers deserve.
Talbot Sutter, Sutter & Nugent Inc, Palm Beach Gardens, FL
Excellent customer service
Fernando, Portugal
We advertise with JamesEdition as it offers an unparalleled reach into international markets for our exotic cars. We have some of the rarest vehicles in the world and the JamesEdition platform has proven to be incredibly effective for us.
James Huntley, SuperVettura, London, UK
We as a seller of Luxury-, Sports-, and Hypercars, wanted to increase our network of potential clients and partners. Since we joined JamesEdition we experienced a massive amount of potential and reputable buyers. JamesEdition is a must have platform for Business owners who want to sell and buy luxury goods.
Konstantin Hollmann, Hollmann, Stuhr, Germany
JamesEdition offers access to a premium target demographic and maximizes exposure for our high-end listings. Since our initial interactions with the platform, our advisors have experienced immense success, both locally and abroad, effectively raising the profile of our business and expanding our core client base.
Christa Huffstickler, Engel & Völkers Atlanta, GA
Marketplace platforms have a huge potential in terms of multicultural and qualified buyer reach. We opted into the JamesEdition platform, and presently it’s one of our leading partners in the luxury field.
Angel Belanche, Andorra Sotheby's International Realty
I have been assisting private owners with buying and selling exotics through my brokerage service since 2004 when I departed from Lamborghini franchised dealer. I have known about JamesEdition for many years, although I continued to use the old sources of advertising. I recently started advertising with JamesEdition, and I have just sold a low mileage Fayence Yellow CGT and also a very special Lexus LFA Nurburgring for a couple good clients.
Brian Albertson, Exotic Car Search, Billings, MO
The only site in the world where you should be marketing and selling your luxury products. JamesEdition is the Rolls Royce of selling websites and should be treated that way. 
Nathaniel, Canada
We joined JamesEdition as it provides us with an opportunity to present our bespoke classic car craftsmanship to an internationally targeted market of luxury purchasers. The platform has created that link on a global scale, all while maintaining the key message of our brand - something that is extremely important to our business.
Shawn Eastman, Hemmels, Cardiff, UK
High quality pictures, all the information you need, and a number to contact in case of interest. Also a very user-friendly and easy site to navigate.
Antonio, Brazil
Truly the best of the best when it comes to the Luxury Marketplace. Also an amazing platform to market all things luxury.
Chris Mitchel, Bluegrass Sotheby's International Realty, Lexington, KY
Been on the website for at least 7-8 years and I love it!
Henry, United Kingdom
Excellent listings and very user friendly, both for mobile and desktop
Hans, Germany
I love the ease of searching amazing properties from around the world
Tom, United States
I have been a fanatic of this site since it was called JamesList. It’s like craigslist meets offerup for the wealthy. Excellent place to find the unique gift for a loved one. It’s where I found a rare 1960 Silver Cloud. That car that I spend nearly half of my life to find in pristine condition.
Mike, United States
Best cars around with high quality pics and legit info!
