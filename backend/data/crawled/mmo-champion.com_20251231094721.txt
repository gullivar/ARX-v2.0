While Blizzard recently outlined some achievements tied to the pre-patch, there was little mention of Delves, Mythic+ and Horrific Visions. For example, as covered last week, the Let Me Solo Her: Nexus-Princess Ky'veza achievement is likely becoming unavailable with the Midnight pre-patch. The Feats of Strength from Horrific Visions Revisited may also be going away (similar to what happened at the end of Battle for Azeroth), which could be the case since the content was originally advertised on the Battle.net launcher as a limited-time event. Players interested in these rewards should complete any remaining achievements before the pre-patch to be on the safe side. Manaforge Omega Raid The War Within Season 3 Mythic+ The War Within Season 3 PvP The War Within Season 3 Delves The War Within Season 3 Gear System Horrific Visions Revisited Legion Remix Manaforge Omega Raid Name Reward Ahead of the Curve: Dimensius, the All-Devouring Defeat Dimensius, the All-Devouring in Manaforge Omega on Heroic difficulty or higher, before the release of the next raid tier.

How it Works Get Tender Every Month At the beginning of each month, players with an active account in good standing will receive 500 Trader’s Tender automatically every month from a chest called the Collector’s Cache. If you don’t have active game time on your account or aren’t a subscriber at the start of a new month, don’t worry. Your Tender will be awarded on the first day of the month when you do have game time or an active subscription. This will be the same amount for everyone, regardless of how you pay for your game time. The Traveler's Log Complete monthly activities listed in the new Traveler’s Log. Each month features a rotating, themed set of activities. These activities provide the opportunity to earn up to 500 additional Trader’s Tender. There’s only a set amount of Tender you can earn each month through completing activities, so you won’t need to complete all the ones in the log each month. You’ll be able to pick and choose from a variety of fun in-game activities to easily earn Tender. Players can choose to earn by continuing to play the game as they already do, such as completing quests, competing in battlegrounds, participating in holiday activities, and even running Mythic+ dungeons. But you can also choose to take part in activities uniquely designed for the month. Freeze an Item Before the month comes to an end, if you haven’t purchased that one “must-have” item yet, don’t worry. You can “freeze” an item so you can purchase it later. When you freeze an item, it will stay available month over month until it is purchased or replaced. If this month’s offerings didn’t have the items you wanted, you can hang on to your Trader’s Tender to spend later. It won’t go anywhere, and unspent Tender will continue to accumulate each month. Learn more about the Trading Post from the news post on the official site. *The Trading Post feature is not available in WoW Classic titles. **Requires World of Warcraft Subscription or Game Time ***Requires Level 10 to access the Adventure Guide.
