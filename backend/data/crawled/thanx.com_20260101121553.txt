Here’s why: Why Thanx 01 Don’t reach enough guests Appeal to highly engaged groups only; they ignore the majority of your guests. 1 02 Rely on costly discounts Train guests to wait for a deal instead of building genuine loyalty. 2 03 Look like everyone else Using generic templates that fail to reflect what makes your brand unique 3 04 Marketing tools are clunky Too complex to personalize at scale, so brands fall back on generic, one-size-fits-all campaigns. 4 We measure success in outcomes 223% Growth in loyalty capture rate (% of sales from loyalty) 5x Average growth in engaged guests in first year on Thanx 2.4% Average discount rate, reduced from 10% Our platform was purpose-built to drive frequency profitably.
