My site had a terrible problem but Alex kept working to solve it despite the fact that it went on till well after 6pm. I was so relieved to have it back & working again!

Great support by the team as always, even go that extra mile and provide advice on services that are not delivered by 34sp themselves.

Comment from my colleague: \The man on the telephone was very helpful and so has got me back into the email on my computer and helped me set it up on my iphone! Excellent!\" """

The support member quickly helped me sort a problem I was having migrating a copy of the the DB from live to localhost. Technically, they could have said it wasn’t a 34SP problem but they gave friendly assistance (it was siteurl setting) and helped me get the site working on local. Fantastic!

James dealt with my plea for help in quickly and efficiently. I almost never do feedback, but he deserved it - many thanks to all at 34SP for your continued support.
