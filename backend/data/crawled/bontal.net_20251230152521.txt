Bon's Home on the internet! Have some COOKIES, or Biscuits if you're BRITISH,
Please grab a seat, enjoy a cup of teh tarik ice and Scroll Down.

Oh yes, I forgot to introduce myself - I'm Kai, All my friends know me as Bon but yupp I want to be called Kai from now on. So if you don't know me as Bon already, call me Kai!

Here's my portfolio page, if you care. I also have a poorly written blog. FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM!!

So what's my story? I'm currently completing my final year in computer science at the University of Newcastle here in Singapore, and yes I'm in my final year so that would be great if you care to give me a job haha.

I've built a whole ass fucking shell from scratch, written my own mini C standard library, created a 2D game without a game engine, developed an AI-powered learning assistant that makes course materials searchable (Hiraku), and even a mobile app to help students find their classrooms. Oh, and I made this meditation app called Bing Chilling that's on Google Play Store.

Currently looking for roles as a system engineer, backend dev, or full stack roles in Singapore or Japan.
