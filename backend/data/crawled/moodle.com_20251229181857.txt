"I like Moodle’s architecture for the learning management system. It offers multiple options to upload videos, and audio, and provide assignments to students. It also has quiz options and many more features. I don’t need much time to develop and deploy the learning management system. I can install Moodle in 5-10 minutes on my server. The installation process is also easy for non-tech persons."

The various publication sectors are well organised and easily accessible, and if you want to download content to your mobile phone or computer, it is immediate with no intermediate steps."

"Moodle makes my mood(le). Moodle is a learning platform that has provided me with many qualitative opportunities during hours of studying and preparing for university exams. It recently had an update, and now even personal organization of the dashboard is possible through the selection of preferred tools and their order. Everything I need for lectures is there."

"I have 15 years of success using Moodle. Moodle is equipped with all the tools I need to provide online instruction in my Microsoft 365 online courses. With Moodle, I was able to develop and implement an online training methodology that has proven successful from the beginning, thanks to Moodle’s infrastructure. I always check the students’ results, update course content, and update didactics. The overall results are exceptional: student retention is ~100%, and student satisfaction is ~98% and improving."
