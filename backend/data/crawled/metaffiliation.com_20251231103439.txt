HTTP redirection is a method used to take visitors from one URL to another. This can be beneficial in a variety of situations: Page has moved: Redirects ensure visitors can find what they're looking for, even if the content has moved to a new URL. Domain Change: When changing the domain of a website, redirects help take visitors from the old domain to the new one. URL Shortening: Short URLs can be created for easier sharing, with redirects taking visitors to the correct, longer URL. Load Balancing: Traffic can be distributed across multiple servers to balance the load, using redirects.
