CUSTOMER CARE THAT ACTUALLY CARES

We understand the importance of having great customer service. Which is why some of the best people in the biz are ready to help you out with all things Mint.

Super short wait times (typically under 2-3 minutes)

Easy to speak with an actual human (unlike every other wireless company)

Self-service options (videos, FAQs, 24/7 chat feature)

Our prices may be low, but you'll never get anything less than the highest level of service.
