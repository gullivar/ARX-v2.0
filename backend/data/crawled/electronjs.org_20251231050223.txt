Why Electron?
Powered by the web

Electron embeds Chromium and Node.js to bring JavaScript to the desktop.

Cross-platform

Electron apps run natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux across all supported architectures.

Open to all

Electron is an open-source project under the OpenJS Foundation maintained by an active community of contributors.

Stable

Electron's bundled Chromium build ensures that your app has a stable rendering target with all the newest web platform features.

Secure

Electron releases major versions in lockstep with Chromium so you get security fixes as soon as they are available.

Extensible

Use any package from the rich npm ecosystem, or write your own native add-on code to extend Electron.

Trusted by best-in-class apps

Popular consumer and rock-solid enterprise apps use Electron to power their desktop experiences.

Desktop development made easy

Electron takes care of the hard parts so you can focus on the core of your application.

Native graphical user interfaces

Interact with your operating system's interfaces with Electron's main process APIs. Customize your application window appearance, control application menus, or alert users through dialogs or notifications.

Automatic software updates

Send out software updates to your macOS and Windows users whenever you release a new version with Electron's autoUpdater module, powered by Squirrel.

Application installers

Use community-supported tooling to generate platform-specific tooling like Apple Disk Image (.dmg) on macOS, Windows Installer (.msi) on Windows, or RPM Package Manager (.rpm) on Linux.

App store distribution

Distribute your application to more users. Electron has first-class support for the Mac App Store (macOS), the Microsoft Store (Windows), or the Snap Store (Linux).

Crash reporting

Automatically collect JavaScript and native crash data from your users with the crashReporter module. Use a third-party service to collect this data or set up your own on-premise Crashpad server.

Use the tools you love

With the power of modern Chromium, Electron gives you an unopinionated blank slate to build your app. Choose to integrate your favourite libraries and frameworks from the front-end ecosystem, or carve your own path with bespoke HTML code.

EXPERIMENT WITH THE API
Electron Fiddle

Electron Fiddle lets you create and play with small Electron experiments. It greets you with a quick-start template after opening — change a few things, choose the version of Electron you want to run it with, and play around.

Save your Fiddle either as a GitHub Gist or to a local folder. Once pushed to GitHub, anyone can quickly try your Fiddle out by just entering it in the address bar.
