Terry Mattingly Every now and then, someone sends me a URL pointing to some kind of abomination with a butchered movie running somewhere on basic cable or hidden deep inside the bowels of a streaming service website. It’s easy to mutter, “We live in a sinful, fallen world.” Frankly, it’s amazing that bored people handling off-hour broadcasts don’t fall asleep at key switches more often... Keeping the Heat On: How Finances Work in the Diocese of Fairbanks... Jack Figge It takes a lot of money to run a parish or diocese. Personnel, property, and insurance costs quickly add up, no matter where you live. But few dioceses have a budget line for snowmobiles and bush plane flights, or operating costs for remote parishes that cannot be accessed by road. The Diocese of Fairbanks has that. Spanning the northern 409,849 square miles of Alaska... 4 Habits to Help You Get Along Better With Others... Dr. Ray Guarendi Have you ever met someone and immediately liked them? Why such a good first impression? Afterward you realized: She was interested in you. She genuinely liked hearing about the bits and pieces of who you are. Your mother-in-law believes your parenting could use some adjustment. She comments and corrects, each time you listen slower and argue faster... The Day Our Daughter Disappeared... Patrick Madrid After being out of town for several days doing back-to-back speaking events, I arrived home exhausted. Needing sleep, I lay down on my bed for a nap. The next thing I knew, my wife was shaking me awake, saying something urgent about our five-year-old daughter, Rebecca. “What?” I asked groggily. “What’s going on?” “We can’t find Rebecca!” Nancy said, in a tone...

Paul Scalia The collect for today’s feast prays, “O God, who were pleased to give us the example of the Holy Family, graciously grant that we may imitate them.” Now, that’s a tall order. After all, the Holy Family was exceptional. Inimitable, one might say. Joseph and Mary were indeed married. But their marriage was unlike any other...

When does Christmas really end? God Became a Burden to Take Away Our Burden... Clement Harrold An aspect of the Christmas story we often fail to notice is the way that God, through the Incarnation, became a burden to Mary and Joseph and the people around them. From Luke’s Gospel we know that Jesus’s parents were not wealthy, yet that didn’t stop God from asking them to have a child sooner than they had anticipated... Which of these aerial masterpieces should win the Great Grinch Sky Art Showdown? Pope Leo XIV’s Angelus on Feast of St. Stephen: ‘Christians Have No Enemies, Only Brothers and Sisters’... How Feminism Has Escaped Public Scrutiny... Carrie Gress There are a growing number of scholars today who can be considered anti-feminists. These men and women are starting to look under the hood of the feminist ideology. What is surprising is that more people haven’t done so before. Most people have blithefully believed that it is simply a movement about helping women. In my forthcoming book... Why the Birth of Jesus Matters...

Jan. 1 Mass Readings: Follow Mary, Mother of God, and Mary of ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’... Tom Hoopes January 1 is the Octave Day of Christmas, eight days after the celebration of the Nativity of Our Lord, a second Christmas Solemnity, Christmas Day II. But it isn’t called that. Instead it is the Solemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God. That fact alone shows the singularity of Mary. The Octave of Easter Sunday is Easter Sunday II, a second day to celebrate what Jesus did... US Executions Rise in 2025 Amid Shifting Public Opinion... Secularism, Security, and ‘Civilizational Erasure’... George Weigel Twenty years ago, I published a small book, The Cube and the Cathedral: Europe, America, and Politics Without God. It enjoyed a fair sale, got translated into French, Spanish, Polish, Italian, Portuguese, and Hungarian, and was named a Foreign Affairs Bestseller. In it, I argued that Europe was experiencing a crisis of “civilizational morale,” evident in sclerotic governmental bureaucracies... South Korea is choosing self-destruction — and the world should learn its lesson... Surviving Your Current Chaos With Confidence... Chris Stefanick One of the most comforting truths of our faith is also one of the hardest to accept. You’re not living the whole story — you’re living your current page. One of the most powerful (and overlooked) truths of the Bible is typology—the way God weaves the same story across centuries, fulfilling promises in ways no human author could plan... Dick Van Dyke at 100... David Deavel Dick Van Dyke’s new memoir puts it out front: he’s no genius. Instead, he’s been lucky personally and professionally. On the professional side this book is flawless: no soft-pedaling failures or 20-20 hindsight about his prospects; no easy vengeance on long-dead nemeses; no pedantic hints for aspiring performers; and no (thank God!) explanations about what makes jokes funny. This Sunday: Mary and Joseph Reveal the High Purpose and Hard Work of Family Life... Architect Frank Gehry and the Cathedral That Might Have Been... Fr. Raymond de Souza The Catholic world is preparing for the centenary next year of the death of Antoni Gaudí, the Spanish architect who imagined the Sagrada Família church in Barcelona, a striking 20th-century conception of all creation singing the praises of God, in forms and shapes taken from the natural world... What are plenary indulgences and how can I get TWO this New Year’s? Catholics Pray for Speaker Paul Kim’s 5-Year-Old Son, Now On Life Support, Calling on Ven. Fulton Sheen... Alyssa Murphy Catholics across the globe are lifting up 5-year old Micah Kim in prayer this Christmas season. His father, Paul Kim, a popular Catholic speaker and comedian, husband and father to six children, shared on Dec. 22, that Micah had suffered a “medical emergency” and was in an ambulance heading to the hospital... ‘As You Wish’: Truth and True Love in Rob Reiner’s ‘The Princess Bride’... God wants to give you two great gifts for Christmas: Himself, and His mission... Fr. Roger Landry There are many ways we can approach the nearly inexhaustible mystery of Christmas. We can meditate on the divine humility of God’s becoming one of us, on his deliberate choice to become a helpless baby, and to number himself among the poor. We can focus on the holiness of those gathered around a manger, especially Mary and Joseph, and on the quiet strength of the domestic church that shelters the baby Savior of the world.
