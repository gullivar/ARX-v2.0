The Story So Far
Ultimate Edition
New to Diablo IV?
Become Sanctuary’s Holy Warrior

Stand against the darkness as the Paladin, Diablo IV’s newest playable class. Sworn by sacred oath and armed with hammers, shields, and radiant Light, the Paladin brings righteous strength to every battlefield.

Pre-purchase Lord of Hatred and unlock Paladin Early Access and lead the charge before the expansion arrives. Master holy techniques, shape your build, and confront Mephisto’s growing influence with divine might at your side.

Road to Lord of Hatred

Sanctuary has weathered horrors, but none without cost. Lilith’s return shattered fragile alliances and left the world scarred; her fall only deepened the fractures running through the lands. In the wilds of Nahantu, new truths surfaced—whispers of a deeper, older malice stirring beyond the veil.

As the faithful, the desperate, and the corrupted clash, one presence threads through every tragedy: Mephisto. His influence coils through the world, guiding events toward Skovos and the coming reckoning. The story of Diablo IV has been building to this climactic moment.
