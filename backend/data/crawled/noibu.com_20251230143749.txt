“If you’re doing any reasonable volume on an ecommerce site, having the ability to get recordings for checkout errors with Noibu is a no brainer.”

John Merris
CEO

"The biggest win for us has been saving critical development hours. We were spending a lot of time replicating issues and we have been able to cut down on that with Noibu."

Carrie McMahon
Ecommerce Product Manager

“As you can imagine, it’s really hard to track down issues when you don’t know what browser the customer was using, which device they were on, what they had in their basket, or any of their other session details at all. It’s often really hard to replicate an issue that a random customer has, and Noibu has definitely helped in that aspect.”

Daniel Collier
Head of IT

“From a PAT and UAT perspective, Noibu was something that was critical to the success of fixing ongoing issues that would arise.“

Anique Ahmed
Manager of Digital Platform Health & Data Management

“I see Noibu as a security initiative. I know that when we revise code, add new features, or make any big changes to our site, we have Noibu providing a regular health check. The platform helps keep everything more well-maintained and avoids the need for any security audits at our end."

Jessie Kressen
Director of Marketing

"Replicability has been a huge win. Noibu takes the guesswork out of replicability by ensuring that our development agency doesn’t have to spend hours investigating issues.”

Matthew Medlyn
Head of Ecommerce

"I think about Noibu as a virtual 24/7 tech support agent that lives on all of our pages and is looking for issues and bubbling them to us proactively, allowing us to deliver the best customer experience. When customers are not having a delightful experience, it brings up those issues to us and tells us exactly what to do to solve them."

Nathan Armstrong
Director, Customer Solutions

“With Noibu, we are able to turn that customer conversation around to. ‘I’m so sorry that was an inconvenience to you. I believe you. I have everything I need to replicate the error and I’m going to share it with my developers.’ Noibu has helped bring about a really big change in how we receive and process customer complaints.”

Kathryn Hutchison
VP of Ecommerce

“Noibu is like an insurance policy [that] gives you peace of mind. It gives you the confidence to make new releases knowing that you’ve got something to make sure that things don’t go wrong.”

Marcel Mundt
Web Development Team Lead

“We're trying to be more consumer focused. And the fact that we can put a dollar value next to an issue allows us to have a business case to justify the work. It’s not just about what’s broken—it’s about what we can improve. Noibu helps us uncover what’s costing us money, even if no one’s reporting it.”

Eric Kelsey
Senior Technical Product Manager

“Noibu's script helped us uncover the true nature of bugs on our site. It really opened our eyes to start being more proactive.”

Corinne Julien
Director of Ecommerce

“The value for Ribble is at multiple levels: visibility, speed, accuracy, priority—all things combined, results in incredible value.”

Matthew Lawson
Chief Digital Office

“I’m sure every retailer is facing the same problem. It’s hard to make sure that we as a business are operating at 100% on every browser and device known to man.”

Fiona Brown
Head of Ecommerce and Digital Marketing

“The value of this tool is honestly impressive. It provides a lot more data and visibility than anything that we've had before, and I think it's actually going to dramatically increase conversion and improve our customers visits on the website so that they don't get annoyed and rage click and leave.”

Jen Pearson
VP of Information Technology & Ecommerce

“The alignment of errors to profit has been game-changing for me. Noibu’s ability to pinpoint the financial impact of errors is not something I’ve seen before. Because it’s so helpful to know which error we’re losing money on and whether it’s worthy of doing a hotfix.”

Todd Purcell
Senior Director Ecommerce Engineering

“Being able to quantify errors resolved based on revenue saved is irreplaceable for me. I love being able to put a dollar amount to errors, so we actually know what level of priority it is.”

Martine Knight
Director of Digital Commerce

“We’ve been using Noibu for two years, across five storefronts. It gives us a lot of visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes in areas that we would not catch. We’re able to fix issues quickly, with little downtime.”

Joe Bona
Senior Software Engineer

“Noibu is something I definitely would recommend to anybody who is having that frustration with identifying and trying to correlate these different points of information with identifying what the root cause of an issue is within your customers' user experience.”

Jared Poole
Technical Support Manager for Digital Commerce

“We brought Noibu in, and it has been a huge success. Not only has it helped detect bugs prior to customers calling in and telling us about them, but it has also really helped me and our engineers to smoothen out our processes.”

“As you can imagine, it’s really hard to track down issues when you don’t know what browser the customer was using, which device they were on, what they had in their basket, or any of their other session details at all. It’s often really hard to replicate an issue that a random customer has, and Noibu has definitely helped in that aspect.”

Daniel Collier
Head of IT

"The biggest win for us has been saving critical development hours. We were spending a lot of time replicating issues and we have been able to cut down on that with Noibu."

Carrie McMahon
Ecommerce Product Manager

“If you’re doing any reasonable volume on an ecommerce site, having the ability to get recordings for checkout errors with Noibu is a no brainer.”

John Merris
CEO

“We brought Noibu in, and it has been a huge success. Not only has it helped detect bugs prior to customers calling in and telling us about them, but it has also really helped me and our engineers to smoothen out our processes.”

Jennifer Rodriguez
Ecommerce Operations Analyst

“Noibu is something I definitely would recommend to anybody who is having that frustration with identifying and trying to correlate these different points of information with identifying what the root cause of an issue is within your customers' user experience.”

Jared Poole
Technical Support Manager for Digital Commerce

“We’ve been using Noibu for two years, across five storefronts. It gives us a lot of visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes in areas that we would not catch. We’re able to fix issues quickly, with little downtime.”

Joe Bona
Senior Software Engineer

“Being able to quantify errors resolved based on revenue saved is irreplaceable for me. I love being able to put a dollar amount to errors, so we actually know what level of priority it is.”

Martine Knight
Director of Digital Commerce

“The alignment of errors to profit has been game-changing for me. Noibu’s ability to pinpoint the financial impact of errors is not something I’ve seen before. Because it’s so helpful to know which error we’re losing money on and whether it’s worthy of doing a hotfix.”

Todd Purcell
Senior Director Ecommerce Engineering

“The value of this tool is honestly impressive. It provides a lot more data and visibility than anything that we've had before, and I think it's actually going to dramatically increase conversion and improve our customers visits on the website so that they don't get annoyed and rage click and leave.”

Jen Pearson
VP of Information Technology & Ecommerce

“I’m sure every retailer is facing the same problem. It’s hard to make sure that we as a business are operating at 100% on every browser and device known to man.”

Fiona Brown
Head of Ecommerce and Digital Marketing

“The value for Ribble is at multiple levels: visibility, speed, accuracy, priority—all things combined, results in incredible value.”

Matthew Lawson
Chief Digital Office

“Noibu's script helped us uncover the true nature of bugs on our site. It really opened our eyes to start being more proactive.”

Corinne Julien
Director of Ecommerce

“We're trying to be more consumer focused. And the fact that we can put a dollar value next to an issue allows us to have a business case to justify the work. It’s not just about what’s broken—it’s about what we can improve. Noibu helps us uncover what’s costing us money, even if no one’s reporting it.”

Eric Kelsey
Senior Technical Product Manager

“Noibu is like an insurance policy [that] gives you peace of mind. It gives you the confidence to make new releases knowing that you’ve got something to make sure that things don’t go wrong.”

Marcel Mundt
Web Development Team Lead

“With Noibu, we are able to turn that customer conversation around to. ‘I’m so sorry that was an inconvenience to you. I believe you. I have everything I need to replicate the error and I’m going to share it with my developers.’ Noibu has helped bring about a really big change in how we receive and process customer complaints.”

Kathryn Hutchison
VP of Ecommerce

"I think about Noibu as a virtual 24/7 tech support agent that lives on all of our pages and is looking for issues and bubbling them to us proactively, allowing us to deliver the best customer experience. When customers are not having a delightful experience, it brings up those issues to us and tells us exactly what to do to solve them."

Nathan Armstrong
Director, Customer Solutions

"Replicability has been a huge win. Noibu takes the guesswork out of replicability by ensuring that our development agency doesn’t have to spend hours investigating issues.”

Matthew Medlyn
Head of Ecommerce

“I see Noibu as a security initiative. I know that when we revise code, add new features, or make any big changes to our site, we have Noibu providing a regular health check. The platform helps keep everything more well-maintained and avoids the need for any security audits at our end."

Jessie Kressen
Director of Marketing

“From a PAT and UAT perspective, Noibu was something that was critical to the success of fixing ongoing issues that would arise.“
