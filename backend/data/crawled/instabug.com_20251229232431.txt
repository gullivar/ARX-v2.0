Why agentic observability now?
The mobile market is fragmented, reactive, and manual. Teams need a smarter, autonomous approach to deliver exceptional experiences at scale.
Move Beyond Monitoring
Most tools stop at alerts, leaving teams stuck in manual fixes. Platforms should act, turning alerts into autonomous resolution.
End-to-End Automation
Detection, diagnosis, and resolution are fragmented. A unified system closes the loop, removing context switching and guesswork.
Business Impact
App performance drives revenue and loyalty. Linking quality to outcomes frees teams to focus on innovation and growth.
Not just AI. Agentic AI - built to act, not just analyze.
Traditional observability only flags issues after they disrupt users. Luciq’s agentic AI proactively detects and resolves problems, preventing failures before they occur to deliver seamless mobile experiences.

Because of Luciq, we are now 99.9% crash-free on Android. And on iOS we dropped by a factor of five. And this was the first go around. The application became very stable and quite robust because it has Luciq to track and measure and manage crash data.
