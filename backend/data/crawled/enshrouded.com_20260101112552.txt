Enshrouded is a light survival Action RPG set in a vast, hand-crafted world, where every mountain, desert, and water hold a secret. Shape the land itself through voxel terraforming, build sanctuaries amid the ruins, and uncover the echoes of a fallen age. Beneath the surface, the Flame still burns — waiting for those who dare to kindle it once more. HEART POUNDING ACTION COMBAT As the Shroud consumes the land it corrupts, mutates and guides all life it encounters. Cleave your way through ravaging factions and formidable bosses, battling Scavengers in the forests, Vukah in the mountains, and Fell creatures in the mist. Duck, parry, and surprise your foes with unexpected fighting skills and powerful spells. Exploit the weaknesses of your enemies as you develop your own unique playstyle with an in-depth skill tree system.
