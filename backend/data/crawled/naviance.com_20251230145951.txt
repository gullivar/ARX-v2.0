One of our district’s strategic goals is to create environments that foster student success with equity and access by improving student mastery of learning standards and generating key outcomes such as an improved graduation rate. PowerSchool, specifically Naviance CCLR, affords our students the opportunity to attain success by providing equitable access to college and career information and resources.

DENA MCTYRE
Counseling Coordinator
Dekalb County School

Our counselors think it’s a great product. It looks great. When we did the training, they love the reports. We love that we’re going to be able to collect data. As the CTE supervisor, I love that.

JACKIE VESTER
CTE Program Supervisor

I feel that Naviance is the best opportunity for meeting the goal of having students be college and career ready and offering them information that they can really absorb and be successful with.

ERIC LOCKHART
District Educational Testing Coordinator
Torrance Unified School District

I think students are ready for something fresh and new, something different, something that really meets their demands while exploring various careers and actually finding careers that fit them really well. We’re looking forward to Naviance CCLR being that platform that really connects our students to the careers they are deeply interested in.
