It provides the communication method and data models that allow eLearning content and LMSs to work together. It tells programmers how to write code so that what they build will “play well” with other eLearning software. SCORM is the most widely used eLearning standard available. Learn more Why should I use SCORM? The biggest benefit of SCORM is interoperability. If you create content, your client will need to upload that content into their LMS. If you are an LMS or Learning Platform provider, a client will want to import content from other sources. SCORM takes care of making sure content is compatible with an LMS and that an LMS can import, launch and track content. Learn more What are the technical details? SCORM is composed of three sub-specifications. Content packaging specifies how content should be packaged and described. Run-Time specifies how content should be launched, how data communicates with the LMS and includes the spec for the data model of that communication. Lastly, Sequencing specifies how a learner can navigate between parts of a course (SCOs).
