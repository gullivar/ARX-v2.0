                    We do not just reduce image quality from 80% to 40% like others do. The result is images that are either under-optimized or over-optimized. ShortPixel takes a totally different approach.
                    Our goal is to deliver the original-looking images at the smallest possible size. And to achieve that, we take each image and optimize it multiple times with our proprietary algorithms until we have the perfect, smallest possible image. Next-gen WebP and AVIF formats While JPEG is still the most popular format, new formats like WebP and AVIF offer better image quality at smaller file sizes. And that means faster websites and therefore better SEO rankings. Who does not want that?! ShortPixel takes all the complexity away from you and makes everything simple: with just a few clicks you can convert all your JPG/PNG images to WebP/AVIF and make them available to the right browsers.
