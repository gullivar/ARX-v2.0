CARDI B WILL SPEND JANUARY REHEARSING ’10 TO 12 HOURS A DAY’ FOR HER LONG-AWAITED 2026 TOUR
A couple weeks ago, Cardi B shared that's she's been on the treadmill preparing for her upcoming tour, which launches in February 2026. Now she has revealed just what her workload will look like in the coming weeks. In a video shared today (December 29), Cardi starts with a message for some of her more combative followers, who she says have "been dragging me for three or four days." She notes, "Y'all been a little bit too mean," before continuing: "2026 is in a couple of days. I have so much work to do once January starts that is stressing…

UPROXX’S BAYLEE LEFTON HIGHLIGHTS AMAZING GUITAR MOMENTS WITH HER LATEST PLAYLIST
Keeping up with music news and resources like Spotify's giant and regularly updated New Music Friday playlist are great ways to keep your listening habits from getting stale. Sometimes, though, you need a deeper dive. That's where Uproxx's Baylee Lefton comes in as she routinely offers quick-hit lists of songs you need to add into your rotation this week. She just delivered a fresh mix and it features tracks that have amazing guitar moments. https://www.instagram.com/p/DSvZJS0EiUg/ The set kicks off with a live rendition of Gary Clark Jr.'s "Our Love," of which Baylee notes, "I saw Gary Clark Jr. in concert…

SELENA GOMEZ, BENNY BLANCO, AND TAYLOR SWIFT HAD SOME OF 2025’S MOST-LIKED INSTAGRAM POSTS
2025 was full of huge music stories: the Oasis reunion, AI music, Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl Halftime Show, and so on. As far as what was popping off on social media, that falls more in the pop sphere. Per data collected on Wikipedia and accurate as of December 24, the most-like Instagram post from an American musician shared in 2025 comes from Taylor Swift, as her and Travis Kelce's engagement announcement has over 37.6 million likes. Also on the list are photos from Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's wedding, which garnered 24.6 million likes. The year's most-liked post overall comes…

UPROXX’S JOYPOCALYPSE DECLARES VIAGRA BOYS ARE POST-PUNK AT ITS MOST FUN
When hearing their band name, it's immediately clear that Viagra Boys are here to have a good time. They offered further evidence of that earlier this year with the title of their 2025 album, the more email-spam-filter-friendly Viagr Aboys. Silliness aside, though, Viagra Boys are also just pumping out the jams in a strong way, delivering a handful of well-received albums since their 2018 debut Street Worms. As Uproxx's Joypocalypse puts it in a new video, post-punk can be fun and humorous, and Viagra Boys do a great job at demonstrating this by not taking themselves too seriously. https://www.instagram.com/p/DSvcj6AEit8/ She…

THE BEST EMO ALBUMS OF 2025
This year's Best Friends Forever festival featured a reunited Texas Is The Reason and Knapsack, Burning Airlines, Rival Schools, Jawbreaker, Mineral's final show, and a Jimmy Eat World headlining set that featured as many songs from Static Prevails as Bleed American; Even then, "Sweetness" and "The Middle" were tacked on last as a veritable encore, existing outside of the spirit of the preceding weekend where Jim Adkins reminisced about his days of dragging bass cabs up staircases and having slept on floors with everyone on the lineup over the age of 40. And yet, while I left Las Vegas inevitably…

SABRINA CARPENTER’S HOLIDAY GIFT IS THE STREAMING RELEASE OF ‘SUCH A FUNNY WAY’
Sabrina Carpenter superfans are already aware of "Such A Funny Way." This summer, she released the song as a vinyl-only bonus track on Man's Best Friend. In September, she briefly made the track available for digital download, writing at the time, "'Such a Funny Way' is a song i am so proud of. the sentiment is one i always thought could really be the end of Man’s Best Friend in another universe!" Now, she has decided to re-purpose the song as a holiday gift for her fans: On Christmas Eve (December 24), she finally made the song available on streaming…

THE BEST MOVIES OF 2025
Presents, food, friends, and family are what this next stretch of the calendar is all about. But for those hours in-between having to go out and turn on, the best films from 2025 are here for you, most of them available to stream, but a few calling you to the theater for buttery popcorn and the less damaging kind of holiday season drama. While you may have seen a lot of these films throughout the year, we tip our cap if you've seen everything here. If you haven't, though, consider this one last holiday season to-do list.

WHAT THE TOP MUSIC VIDEOS OF 2025 SAY ABOUT THE YEAR AHEAD
Few formats drive fan engagement like a great music video. That was true in 2025 and it'll be true in 2026, too. Looking at Warner Music Group's top-performing videos of 2025 offers insight into both what the year in music looked like and how next year is shaping up. Of the year's top ten videos, two of them fall in the Latin music category, proving that the genre's constellation of stars is a part of a cultural juggernaut that brands simply can't afford to miss out on in 2026 and beyond. The other major takeaway is just how much 2024…

HIP-HOP FLIPS THE NARRATIVE IN OUR BREAKDOWN OF 2025’S TOP PERFORMING GENRES
If this year taught us anything, it’s that fans have the final say on which artists, albums, and genres owned the culture in 2025. The conversations they were having on social media and in group chats mattered just as much as any critic-approved list. As you can see from the chart below, artists under the Warner Music Umbrella drove massive audience interest, no matter the genre. But one stands out above the rest despite some in the establishment fretting over more outdated snapshots of the industry. UPROXX Studios Senior Director, Editorial and Content Strategy Philip Cosores has a clear message…

2025’S TOP ARTISTS DIDN’T RELY ON RELEASES ALONE
As we continue to unpack year-end YouTube data around Warner Music Group artists (who UPROXX exclusively represent in deals for channel sponsorships), we wanted to take a look at the top-performing artists and explore the narratives that help explain their dominance. In 2025, the artists who established themselves as top performers on the year-end charts didn’t rely on releases alone; they built experiential ecosystems around their projects. For Benson Boone and NBA YoungBoy, viral festival performances and large-scale tours transformed successful projects into immersive universes that lived beyond release day and the typical half-life for buzz. Who can forget Boone’s…

Few people have been as busy as Fred Again.. lately. In September, he started a rollout of new songs for his ever-evolving USB project, releasing fresh tracks and delivering high-energy live shows on a weekly basis. Even when the initial run finished, Fred went ahead and announced another one, set for early 2026. Even amid all that, he still found an hour to sit down with Instagram for a recent episode of their new long-form interview series "Ask It Anyway." It launched with Tyler, The Creator earlier this year and now Fred is the second-ever guest. In a chat hosted…

Turks and Caicos is the #1 private destination in the Caribbean, which says a lot about the destination and the luxury you can experience there.

ASAP ROCKY WANTS TO ‘MAKE BEING A DAD COOL AGAIN,’ TIM BURTON SAYS
It has been a long, long, long road to ASAP Rocky's upcoming album Don't Be Dumb. In 2022, he said the project was finished. In July 2023, he indicated it'd be out soon. It was later given a summer 2024 release date before getting pushed back to the fall. Towards the end of 2024, it was given an approximate release window of early 2025. That brings us to late 2025 and the album is still not out yet. Finally, though, it appears it'll be here soon. Last week, Rocky took to Instagram to reveal the cover art, created by Tim…

UPROXX’S JOYPOCALYPSE BREAKS DOWN WHY MINOR THREAT’S DIRECTNESS MADE THEM DIY HARDCORE HEROES
Minor Threat were active for a mere three years in the 1980s, and yet, in that short window, they had an indelible influence on hardcore music. The band's Out Of Step and self-titled EPs are considered landmark works in the genre, and the group's song "Straight Edge" was even part of the inspiration for the "straight edge" movement that promotes refraining from drugs, alcohol, and other vices. As Uproxx's Joypocalypse explains in a new video, the band also set the foundation for the DIY aspects of the hardcare genre. https://www.instagram.com/p/DSa2Ac1knbR/ She says: "Hardcore through the lens of Minor Threat: fast,…

KALI UCHIS RESPONDS TO HIGH DEMAND BY RELEASING ‘MUÉVELO,’ A LEAK THAT BECAME A FAN FAVORITE
With just days left until Christmas, we're officially in the annual dry season of new music releases. For the most part, artists are taking the last few weeks of the year off, laying low and relaxing. Kali Uchis had one more thing to say before bidding farewell to 2025, though, as today (December 19), she shared "Muévelo." The song is actually a fan favorite. It stems from the Orquídeas era and fans first heard it as a leak, but recently, there have been calls on social media for Uchis to officially share the full track. Uchis listened and here we…

SZA AND KENDRICK LAMAR HAD A SURPRISE REUNION AT TDE’S CHRISTMAS CONCERT
Kendrick Lamar and SZA spent a lot of time together this year on the Grand National Tour, with SZA co-headlining the North American and European shows, while Kendrick then handled a handful of South American and Australian concerts himself. The two just couldn't end the year without getting together one more time, though.

SHABOOZEY, LUDACRIS, AND CORTIS ARE HEADLINING A SERIES OF 2026 NBA ALL-STAR WEEKEND CONCERTS
It might seem a little early to start thinking about the NBA All-Star game, but actually, voting just opened on December 17. While we wait to see which players will be participating in 2026, the NBA is already starting to reveal what All-Star Weekend is going to look like.

THE BEST TV SHOWS OF 2025
Best-of lists are inherently relative -- we all have our tastes, and we’re sticking to them -- but 2025’s TV felt unusually communal. We were all watching The White Lotus and altering our pronounciation of the word "Lorazepam" just a few months ago, piecing together the mind-bending mysteries of Severance, and desperately googling medical terms to keep up with the relentless life-saving measures of The Pitt. Even as the year kept throwing us curveballs, these shows created a kind of shared experience, a fleeting sense that maybe we were all in this bizarre, screen-addled world together. (It's funny how simply…

‘GIRLS LIKE GIRLS’: EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT HAYLEY KIYOKO’S SONG-TURNED-BOOK-TURNED-MOVIE
It's been a long journey for "Girls Like Girls." First there was the Hayley Kiyoko song in 2015, then a viral music video. Then, Kiyoko wrote a 2023 novel with the same title. Now, that book has been adapted into a movie. Focus Features picked up the worldwide rights to the film and now it's on its way. Kiyoko co-wrote the movie alongside Stefanie Scott, which is a full-circle moment as Scott starred in the original music video. Ahead of the movie's release, keep reading for everything you need to know before it hits theaters. Plot An official logline reads,…

YOUNG THUG AND MARIAH THE SCIENTIST ARE ENGAGED AFTER A GRAND ON-STAGE PROPOSAL IN ATLANTA
Young Thug and Mariah The Scientist have been together for a while, and now some congratulations are in order, as the couple just got engaged. Thug decided to go very, very public with his proposal. It went down last night (December 16), on stage during Thug's Hometown Hero benefit concert at Atlanta's State Farm Arena. As fan-shot footage like this and this shows, the big screen on stage read "will you marry me?" as Thug was down on one knee. The two hugged and Thug gave Mariah a ring, then she told the cheering audience, "Guess I'm getting married!" Thug…

LORDE HAS SOME BOLD ADVICE FOR HER FANS: ‘SWIM NAKED, HAVE CRAZY SEX, DO DRUGS’
There's just about two weeks left of 2025. So, it's the time of year to start considering any resolutions you might want to implement in the new year. If you're looking for advice there, Lorde has your back, but her advice should definitely be taken alongside some caution. During a concert at Brooklyn last night (December 16), Lorde took a few minutes to give a heartfelt speech, reflecting on how her year has been, how she's been feeling, and things she's been grateful for (here's a video). Towards the end, she offered a series of rapid-fire recommendations: "Don't be afraid…

ROCK FOR PEOPLE’S 2026 LINEUP BOASTS HALSEY, GORILLAZ, IRON MAIDEN, AND MORE AS HEADLINERS
For over three decades now, rock fans in Europe have had the Rock For People festival, which has routinely brought top-tier guitar slingers to the Czech Republic.
