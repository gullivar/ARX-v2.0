A URL shortener is a tool that turns long, complex URLs into short, clean links. When someone clicks a shortened URL, their browser sends a request to the shortener and is redirected via a 301/302 redirect to the original address. Short links are easier to share on social media, in emails, SMS, printed materials and inside QR codes. Cuttly adds analytics, branded domains, Link-in-bio pages, surveys and QR codes on top of basic URL shortening. Is a URL shortener safe to use? Yes, URL shorteners are safe when you use a trusted provider. Cuttly uses secure HTTPS redirects, does not inject ads or scripts and does not modify your destination pages. All analytics are anonymized and you always stay in control of your links. As long as you trust the brand or person who shares the short link, using a URL shortener is as safe as using a regular URL. As with any link online, it’s always good practice to check the final destination page. If a page looks suspicious, asks for sensitive data or feels untrustworthy, simply close it. Staying cautious ensures safe browsing no matter which service you use. Why should I use a URL shortener? Long URLs look messy, break easily in chats and emails and can reduce trust. A URL shortener makes your links short, readable and professional. Short links improve click-through rates, are easier to remember and work better in SMS, social media posts, QR codes, podcasts, printed materials and ads. With Cuttly you also gain detailed analytics and branded link options, so each short URL becomes a measurable asset in your marketing. What is a branded short link? A branded short link uses your own domain (for example yourbrnd.link/promo ) instead of a generic one. This makes your links instantly recognizable, increases trust and typically improves click-through rates. With Cuttly you can connect custom domains, create branded slugs, generate QR codes and track analytics for every branded link you share. Is Cuttly a free URL shortener? Yes. Cuttly offers a Free plan that lets you shorten URLs, generate basic analytics, create QR codes, use Link-in-bio pages and build simple surveys. Paid plans unlock higher limits, branded domains, extended analytics history, hourly heat maps, Campaigns aggregation, TRAI SMS tools and Team features. You can start for free and upgrade later as your needs grow. How long do short URLs created with Cuttly last? Short URLs created with Cuttly do not expire automatically. They remain active as long as the link is not deleted. For branded short links, your custom domain must stay registered and correctly connected. The generic cutt.ly domain is maintained by Cuttly, so those links remain active unless you choose to remove them from your account. Does using a URL shortener affect SEO? No. Modern search engines handle short URLs correctly. Cuttly uses standard 301 redirects, which preserve SEO value and signal that the short URL is a permanent redirect to the original page. You can safely shorten long URLs, landing pages, blog posts and product links without harming rankings. For campaign tracking, you can combine Cuttly with UTM parameters and Google Analytics. What makes Cuttly different from other URL shorteners? Cuttly is more than a simple URL shortener. It combines short links, branded domains, QR codes, Link-in-bio pages, surveys, advanced analytics, hourly heat maps, TRAI SMS tools, Campaign aggregation and Team collaboration in one platform. This makes it suitable for individuals, creators, marketers, agencies and companies that need professional link management rather than just basic shortening.
