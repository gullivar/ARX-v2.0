David Picciuto Hobby Photographer | Master Creator I set out to prove that a desktop laser cutter can make more than coasters and keychains — it can make real furniture. Using the brand-new xTool P3 80W CO2 laser cutter, I designed and built a full-size Danish modern chair entirely from plywood, without touching a table saw or router. Jeannine Small Business Owner I've been running a small business for 8 years, where I create handmade products from Raysin and wood. Through detailed engravings and precise cuts, I can now offer unique items that my customers love. My little shop, "Indivijual," has become even more attractive thanks to xTool. Josh AnglingAI.com Founder Making tiny metal parts for our fishing lures was difficult with our old CNCs. Now with MetalFab, I can easily make 1,000+ parts in-house and no more outsourcing vendors. It's a game-changer, giving me a quick ROI and making my business much more profitable.
