Fast, reliable access to
FDA-approved GLP-1 medications

Expert clinicians assess your goals and, when appropriate, prescribe treatments like Wegovy® and Zepbound®, paired with a structured support program for better results. After one month, Med+ members on GLP-1s who engaged in the GLP-1 Success Program lost 61.3% more body weight than those who didn’t.*

*Based on an internal analysis of 6,191 members who requested at least 1 GLP-1 medication refill through Weight Watchers Med+ and self-reported both a starting weight and weight at week 4. On average, members who logged in to the GLP-1 Success Program at least 4 days each week (n=2,349) lost 4.29% body weight, and members who never logged in to the app (n=3,842) lost 2.66% body weight in 4 weeks. Not a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Self-reported outcomes have not been independently verified. Individual results may vary.

How is your program different from others?

We help you lose weight and build healthy habits, one small step at a time. Fad weight-loss diets can be restrictive, and rarely work long term. We have more than 140 publications that show WeightWatchers’ efficacy to help members lose weight and keep it off. See how WeightWatchers stacks up against the competition.

I've tried Weight Watchers before. What's new?

Our program is now easier to follow, easier to stick with, and more effective than ever before. Here’s how we’re making your journey better:

Meet with a Registered Dietitian for easier, tailored meal planning

Use your camera to track meals and their Points® value

350+ ZeroPoint, no-track foods

Automatic macro tracking of any food you eat

Generate Points® value totals for any recipe on the internet

Access to more affordable weight-loss meds

What foods will I eat on the program?

What you eat is up to you—and we’ll show you how to enjoy your favorite foods in a way that gets you to your goals. With WeightWatchers, there are no “good” or “bad” foods—just nutritious and less nutritious ones.

Who are Weight Watchers experts?

Our team includes nutrition and behavioral scientists, registered dieticians, clinical researchers, and more. Together they help you overcome common weight-loss hurdles—like stress-eating or late-night snacking—while our exclusive Points system makes nutrition easier—so easy that healthier eating will feel like second nature. After you sign up, you’ll answer a few questions to get a plan customized for you, and build healthy habits with proven behavior change techniques.

Will I have access to Coaches?

Always! Weight Watchers coaches are experts specially trained in our nutrition and behavior change science. You can chat with them right in the app. They also lead our in-person and virtual Workshops, teaching weight-loss techniques and providing live coaching to you and other members in the Workshop with you.

Members accessing weight-loss medication through Weight Watchers also get a dedicated Care Team consisting of clinicians, fitness coaches, and registered dietitians.

Does Weight Watchers offer in-person guidance?

Our Workshops (or Meetings, back in the day) are coach-led group sessions held in studio location a or online. You don’t need to go, but the extra support can ramp up your results: WeightWatchers Workshops members lose two times more weight than those who DIY.^ Workshops offer unlimited accountability from coaches and members who really get the weight-loss journey. In-person and virtual Workshops are also now available to WeightWatchers members on our medication plan. Get expert-led nutrition guidance and connect with others on similar journeys for even more success.
