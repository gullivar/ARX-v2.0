What our customers say

Rawlplug, a global manufacturer of anchoring, fixing systems and power tools achieved marketing clarity with Piwik PRO.

“Since implementing Piwik PRO, nearly 100% of our online transactions can be attributed to specific sources. The consulting audit confirmed that 98-99% of our data matches accounting records, compared to just 30% accuracy with Google Analytics.”

Wojciech Telecki

Head of Digital Marketing at Rawlplug

DKMS, an international non-profit organization, optimizes online campaigns and donor registration funnels with GDPR-compliant analytics.

“The general feel of the platform quickly convinced us to use Piwik PRO. After some demo sessions, we got really comfortable with the platform. It was similar to what we’ve known from Google Analytics and, as we looked deeper, we discovered everything we were looking for – in-depth UTM tracking, an easy-to-use Tag Manager, Consent Manager, and all the types of reports we needed. We knew we would be able to introduce Piwik PRO in all our entities without any big issues.”

Digital Project Manager at DKMS

Wien Energie, Austria’s largest regional energy provider, enhanced its customer engagement and loyalty with the Piwik PRO data activation module.

Shepherd Center, a neurorehabilitation hospital from the USA increased patient referrals by 40% with Piwik PRO as their HIPAA-compliant analytics platform.

“Piwik PRO was a privacy-first analytics platform and we really appreciated it. Even without the rules established by HIPAA, we’d still be looking for a platform like Piwik PRO because (…) the practice and the philosophy around privacy mattered to us.”

Chris Walker

Director of Digital Strategy and Marketing at Shepherd Center

Bank Ochrony Środowiska (BOŚ), one of Poland’s 20 largest banks optimized its business, product and marketing strategies with insights gathered through Piwik PRO.

“Implementing Piwik PRO meant a complete shift in our approach to managing analytics. With Piwik PRO, we entered a new era of getting true value with analytics insights. Piwik PRO showed us the potential of using analytics in banking.“

Maja Kosobucka

User Experience Specialist at BOŚ
