Snaps are easy to discover and install. Millions of users can browse and install snaps graphically in the Snap Store or from the command-line. Snaps install and run the same across Linux. They bundle the exact versions of your app’s dependencies. Snaps automatically update to the latest version. Four times a day, users’ systems will check for new versions and upgrade in the background. Upgrades are not disruptive. Because upgrades are not in-place, users can keep your app open as it’s upgraded in the background. Upgrades are safe. If your app fails to upgrade, users automatically roll back to the previous revision. In just a few steps, you’ll have an example C/C++ app in the Snap Store.

Simplify installation instructions, regardless of distribution, to snap install myjavaapp. Directly control the delivery of automatic application updates. Distributing a Java application for Linux and reaching the widest possible audience is complicated.

Therefore, having them done seamlessly in the background makes life for our users so much easier. It’s great to see snaps as the first serious attempt to try and unify the community. Jeff Dickey CLI engineer, Heroku “Starting with snaps is easy” We definitely find Snapcraft easier as it is yaml based and provides details of what artifacts are needed. Debian packaging has things that need to be followed which can be distribution specific, which creates complication. The modular containment is what appealed about snaps and [we] can see it will be a lot more flexible. Starting with snaps is easy and the resources that are provided are clean and structured which aids adoption. Lee Coward and Rakesh Singh .NET (Microsoft) “A major software discovery tool” The Snap store provides additional exposure to our tools for many of our existing and potential users. The decision to use it came quite naturally. We believe the store will be a major software discovery tool on Linux, so the more people find out about our tools naturally and install them more easily, the better for everyone. Aleksey Rostovskiy Engineer, JetBrains Showcase to millions Reach beyond your existing audience with a listing on the Snap Store, the front page for app discovery on Ubuntu and other popular distros. Browse the Snap Store Measure user growth Make data-driven decisions with active install metrics. Watch as automatic updates migrate users to your latest release.
