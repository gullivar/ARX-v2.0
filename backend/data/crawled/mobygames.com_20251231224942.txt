        · 15 comments It's been a little while since the last news post, but we've been hard at work! There are too many updates to list everything, but here are a few: Updates and additions: MobyPlus members can now update the number of results displayed for saved searches on the homepage. You can now jump to any page of Most Wanted. Developer Interview videos will now show up on the pages for the people being interviewed. For example, Eric Osborne . When a soundtrack is displayed on a person's page, if they are credited with an Audio role in the game, this role will be displayed. Now you can tell if the person was the composer, lyricist, or something else. The itch.io scraper will now detect the Browser platform. The GOG and iTunes scrapers can now add Upcoming games. Groups and series are now moved back above media on game overview pages. Error messages like "role name required" when submitting credits will now give more details about where the error is located. Improved error messages when an invalid YouTube URL is submitted. Adding developer sites now requires proof. The automatically gathered YouTube videos and Articles should now be much more accurately categorized and matched with games. This is an area of ongoing improvement. We now hide promo images on the game overview if the game has screenshots. Product codes are now sorted by code type on game releases. The Moby Score column will display by default on the game browser v2, even when not sorting by score. Dark mode toggle has been added to the mobile UI. Approvers: The number of credits in a credit submission will now be displayed in the approval list view. Fixes: Fix: Media pages for people on soundtracks now work correctly even if the person isn't credited on the game. Fix: Scraped covers and promo images will now be added after existing images. Fix: The lists of user contributions to Platform Descriptions and Critic Sources now display correctly. Fix: Soundtracks on Spotify will now work correctly when using the back button in the browser. Fix: The Most Wanted tool will work correctly for recent games missing Moby Score. Fix: Price charts will now correctly indicate that the most recent price is still valid. Fix: The number of games displayed in a filtered collection will now be reported more clearly. Fix: Nintendo.com prices will be updated again. Fix: The Nintendo.com scraper now works again. Fix: Long text without spaces will now wrap in the visual markdown editor rather than making the page scroll to the right. Fix: PlayStation store identifiers will now properly show up on the 'contribute additional content' screen when adding a new game. Fix (approvers): The expired upcoming queue had several misbehaviors that have been corrected. Fix (approvers): Various misbehaviors when moving a platform to a new game (MobyScore being hidden, etc.) have now been corrected. Fix (approvers): Canned responses for covers that have been selected to approve separately from a new game submission will no longer all get checked or unchecked at once.

        · 6 comments We've had a lot of updates since last time! The 'more videos' MobyPlus preview feature has received numerous updates, and now shows a much better selection of videos, with a cleaner interface. We've released another, somewhat similar feature for MobyPlus users to test: a listing of recent articles published by selected gaming news sources. As before, feedback on the selection of articles and how well they're categorized would be very helpful. MobyPlus : The Game Browser v2 now allows you to filter the game list to show only games that have already been released, only upcoming games, or only canceled games. Other updates : Did you know that MobyGames can show you games that were created by the same people? We've had this feature for a long time, hidden away on the credits page. Now, you can find it on the main page for each game. Check it out! Game series groups are now displayed more prominently on game pages, including links to the next and previous main entries in the series. We've released an update to our mobile interface. It makes things a bit less crowded on narrow screens. The PlayStation scraper has been updated. It should now work for all PlayStation games, including upcoming games. Companies and countries are now alphabetized on releases. The 'More Videos' section can now be folded up. The Most Wanted can now be sorted by Moby Score. Want to add missing screenshots for good games? Now you can. Fix: credits on game overview pages won't break the page structure any more. Fix: when adding credits from images, the credit wizard will no longer show a blank page if you've previously added credits using images. Fix: Approvers: 'change status' links on approver edit pages for revisions now go to the right place. Fix: A better error message will be reported when adding critic reviews without selecting a platform. Fix: The expired upcoming games queue will now show expired games that previously were missed.

        · 15 comments This week, we've got two new features in testing for MobyPlus members: The first is Saved Searches . The game browser will now have a button to allow you to save your chosen filters for quick access. You can also pick one of these saved searches to be displayed on the homepage. Want to see the latest games in your favorite series? Keep up with any new puzzle games that have been added? Upcoming games for Switch 2? You can see the top 10 results of any game browser search right on the homepage. Second, some game pages may now display more videos , such as video reviews or development updates from select sources. We'd love to hear from you about the interface, the selection of videos--anything that comes to mind. Since this is a limited test, only a handful of games are included. Check out Hollow Knight: Silksong or Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth to see what it looks like. MobyPlus : Saved searches: you can now save searches in the game browser, and save one to the homepage. More videos: we're testing a new way to display videos on (some) game pages. You can now hide the 'quick links' section on the new homepage design. More small tweaks to the new homepage design. Larger updates, especially for mobile, coming soon. Others : Now upcoming games will be displayed prominently on company pages. Fix: searching for companies with underscores in their names (when adding releases) now works properly.
