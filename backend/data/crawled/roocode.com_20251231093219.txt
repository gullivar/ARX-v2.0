Install VS Code Extension Free and Open Source Try Cloud for Free No credit card needed Helping teams ship more at To trust an agent, you have to do it on your own terms. Roo is designed from the ground up to give you the confidence to do ever more with AI. Model-agnostic by design Flexible and future-proof. "The best model in the world" changes every other week. Providers throttle models with no warning. 1st-party coding agents only work with their own models. Roo doesn't care. It works great with 10s of models, from frontier to open weight. Choose from the curated selection we offer at-cost or bring your own key. Compatible with dozens of providers Role-specific Modes On-task and under control. As capable as they are, when let loose, LLMs hallucinate, cheat and can cause real damage. Roo's Modes keep models focused on a given task and limit their access to tools which are relevant to their role, keeping the context window clearer and avoiding surprises. Modes are even smart enough to ask to switch to another when stepping outside their responsibilities. Some examples Architect Plans complex changes without making changes. Code Implements, refactors and optimizes code. Ask Explains functionality and program behavior. Debug Diagnoses issues, traces failures, and proposes targeted, reliable fixes. Test Creates and improves performant tests without changing the actual functionality. Highly configurable Make it fit your workflow. Developer tools need to fit like gloves. Highly tweakable, keyboard-shortcut-heavy gloves. We made Roo thoughtfully configurable to fit your workflow as best it can. Secure and transparent Open source from the get go. The Roo Code Extension is open source so you can see for yourself exactly what it's doing and we don't use your data for training. Plus we're fully SOC2 Type 2 compliant and follow industry-standard security practices. Different form factors for different ways of working. Roo's always there to help you get stuff done.

Roo Code is an absolute game-changer! 🚀 It makes coding faster, easier, and more intuitive with its smart AI-powered suggestions, real-time debugging, and automation features. The seamless integration with VS Code is a huge plus, and the constant updates ensure it keeps getting better Luca Easily the best AI code editor. Roo Code has the best features and capabilities, along with the best development team. I swear, they're the fastest to support new models and implement useful functionality whenever users mention it... simply amazing. Taro Woollett-Chiba AI Product Lead at Vendidit Roo Code is one of the most inspiring projects I have seen for a long time. It shapes the way I think and deal with software development. Can Nuri I switched from Windsurf to Roo Code in January and honestly, it's been a huge upgrade. Windsurf kept making mistakes and being dumb when I ask it for things. Roo just gets it. Projects that used to take a full day now wrap up before lunch. Michael By far the best coding tool I have used. Looking forward to where this goes in the future. Also, their Discord is an excellent resource with many knowledgeable users sharing their discoveries. Darien Hardin I've tried Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Trae and others, and although using RooCode with OpenRouter is more expensive, it is also far more effective. Its agents and initial setup, and learning how to use Code/Architect/Orchestrator, help a great deal in developing quality projects. Wiliam Azzam Definitely the best AI coding agent extension. Matěj Zapletal We tried the rest, now we are using the best.  The alternatives are more restrictive.  I didn't use competitors for a reason.  This team is killing it. Ali Davachi I work inside Roo about 60+ hours a week and usually roo is building something at all hours of the day. An amazing tool by an amazing team! Ryan Booth i spent a fortune trying to dial in various tools to get them to work the way i want, and then i found roocode.  customizable for your flavors on your terms.  this is what i always wanted. Matthew Martin The BEST. Super fast, no-nonsense, UI that makes sense, many API provider choices, responsive, helpful developer community. Edwin Jacques Roo Code is impressively capable while staying refreshingly simple. It integrates seamlessly into VS Code and handles everything from generating code to refactoring with accuracy and speed. It feels like a natural part of the workflow—no clutter, just results. Extra points for the flexibility of the different agents and the ability to customize them to fit the job. Sean McCann Absolutely amazing extension. I had tried Cursor previously, and this just beats it hands down. I've used it for several large projects now, and it is now my go-to for creating things that would normally take weeks or months. Highly recommended. Colin Tate I've used all the IDEs and all the assistants - Roo Code is hands down the best of them. It's also one of the few that lets you bring your own API keys - no subscriptions required, just pay as you need/go! Fantastic team and support as well! Michael Scott Frequently Asked Questions Everything you need to know about Roo Code and how it can transform your development workflow. What exactly is Roo Code? Roo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding assistant that runs in VS Code. It goes beyond simple autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, and adapting to your workflow—like having a whole dev team right inside your editor. How does Roo Code differ from Copilot, Cursor, or Windsurf? Roo Code is open-source and fully customizable , letting you integrate any AI model you choose (e.g, OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, etc.). It's built for multi-file edits , so it can read, refactor, and update multiple files at once for holistic code changes. Its agentic abilities go beyond a typical AI autocomplete, enabling it to run tests, open a browser, and handle deeper tasks. And you're always in control: Roo Code is permission-based , meaning you can control and approve any file changes or command executions. Is Roo Code really free? Yes! Roo Code is completely free and open-source. You'll only pay for the AI model usage if you use a paid API (like OpenAI). If you choose free or self-hosted models, there's no cost at all. Will my code stay private? Yes. Because Roo Code is an extension in your local VS Code, your code never leaves your machine unless you connect to an external AI API. Even then, you control exactly what is sent to the AI model. You can use tools like .rooignore to exclude sensitive files, and you can also run Roo Code with offline/local models for full privacy. Which AI models does Roo Code support? Roo Code is fully model-agnostic, giving you the flexibility to work with whatever AI models you prefer. It supports OpenAI models (like GPT-4o, GPT-4, and o1), Anthropic's Claude (including Claude 3.5 Sonnet), Google's Gemini models, and local LLMs via APIs or specialized plugins. You can even connect any other model that follows Roo Code's Model Context Protocol (MCP). Does Roo Code support my programming language? Likely yes! Roo Code supports a wide range of languages—Python, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc. Since it leverages the AI model's understanding, new or lesser-known languages may also work, depending on model support. How do I install and get started? Install Roo Code from the VS Code Marketplace (or GitHub). Add your AI keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, or other) in the extension settings. Open the Roo panel (the rocket icon) in VS Code, and start typing commands in plain English! Watch our tutorial to help you get started. Can it handle large, enterprise-scale projects? Absolutely. Roo Code uses efficient strategies (like partial-file analysis, summarization, or user-specified context) to handle large codebases. Enterprises especially appreciate the on-prem or self-hosted model option for compliance and security needs. Learn more about Roo Code for enterprise. Is it safe for enterprise use? Yes. Roo Code was built for enterprise environments. You can self-host AI models or use your own trusted provider. All file changes and commands go through permission gating, so nothing runs without your approval. And because Roo Code is fully open-source, it's auditable—you can review exactly how it works before deploying it. Learn more about Roo Code for enterprise. Can Roo Code run commands and tests automatically? Yes! One of Roo Code's biggest strengths is its ability to execute commands—always optional and fully permission-based. It can run terminal commands like npm install, execute your test suites, and even open a web browser for integration testing when you approve it. What if I just want a casual coding 'vibe'? Roo Code shines for both serious enterprise development and casual "vibe coding." You can ask it to quickly prototype ideas, refactor on the fly, or provide design suggestions—without a rigid, step-by-step process. Can I contribute to Roo Code? Yes, please do! Roo Code is open-source on GitHub . Submit issues, suggest features, or open a pull request. There's also an active community on Discord and Reddit if you want to share feedback or help others. Where can I learn more or get help? Check out our official documentation for both a quick-start set up and advanced guides. You can also get community support on Discord and Reddit .
