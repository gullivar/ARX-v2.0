Learn Math. Know Math. ST Math is the only PreK-8 supplemental program built on the science of how the brain learns–inviting students to explore, make sense of, and build lasting confidence in math through visual problem solving. More than a practice tool, ST Math offers a fundamentally different learning experience—removing barriers, sparking curiosity, and helping all students develop strong conceptual foundations before formal instruction. Complementing any core curriculum, ST Math meets students where they are—and moves them forward. Watch ST Math in Action How Can a Game Change the Way Students Learn Math? By tapping into how the brain naturally learns— visually, through exploration and interaction —ST Math turns math into a meaningful, memorable experience. Students build understanding before symbols, discover patterns through play, and gain confidence through productive struggle. With JiJi ® , as their visual guide, students test ideas, get immediate feedback, and develop the mindset of a mathematical thinker. They’re not just solving problems—they’re making sense of them. Why ST Math Works: A Patented, Proven Approach ST Math is more than a program. It’s a science-backed learning model that consistently delivers results across districts, demographics, and grade levels. Deep Conceptual Understanding Students build mastery by engaging with visual puzzles before being introduced to symbols or equations. Real-Time Formative Feedback Animated responses reveal the why behind answers, helping students reflect and adjust in the moment. Mastery-Based Progression No guessing. Students must solve each puzzle before progressing—ensuring true comprehension at every step. Learning Gains that Stick and Scale Independent studies confirm consistent, significant growth in math proficiency—driven by a neuroscience-based approach proven to work across all learner groups. Equity-Driven by Design By engaging the brain’s natural learning process, ST Math blends spatial-temporal reasoning with the Perception-Action Cycle to remove barriers and support access for all learners—regardless of language, background, or learning differences. Equity is built into how students experience math from the start. Collaborative Learning Math Puzzle Talks encourage students to verbalize thinking, explore strategies, and solve problems together—deepening understanding through discourse. A year later, students still remember how they solved their ST Math puzzles. That is powerful.
