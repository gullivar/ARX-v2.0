About Demonii Tracker

Demonii.com is a bittorrent tracker free for anyone to use. You don't need to register, upload or index a torrent anywhere, all you have to do is to include the Demonii.com tracker URL in your torrent.

How to use

When you create a torrent file the application will ask you for a tracker address, then simply type in one of the Demonii.com tracker URLs:

Why use the Demonii tracker?

There are only a few open independent stable trackers out there, most of the trackers that can be used openly are either unstable or in some way connected to a bittorrent indexing site. We felt there was a need for a free, no strings attached, stable bittorrent tracker.

Other open bittorrent trackers

We encourage you to use multiple trackers, this will increase your torrents accessibility. OpenTrackr and Cyberia.is are other free, no strings attached, stable bittorrent set of trackers.

I already have .torrent files, how can I add your tracker?

For one or a few torrent files you can use a simple torrent editing service like Torrent Editor.
