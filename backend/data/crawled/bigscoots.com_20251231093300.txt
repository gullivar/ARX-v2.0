THANKS AGAIN! Cathy Glowinski These guys are SO good. I moved over from a cheap hosting service years ago that had my sight down for over a week and I had to spend hours on the phone with different tech people trying to get it fixed. After that, I left immediately, found BigScoots and have been with them ever since. Their biggest plus? Their customer service. Any time I have any issue with my website, I feel so safe knowing I can contact them and will get support within minutes. 🙂 Paridhi Jain SkilledSmart Perfect service!! keep it up. Buddhi Prasad Bhatta www.himalayasguide.com The team at Big Scoots has gone above and beyond the service, I expected to receive when I first signed up. I have been building my first WordPress website for my personal professional brand. After our company’s website guy left, I have been largely on my own creating and managing the sites. Scott and Justin are quick to respond to all of my issues and provide a level of care toward solving those issues beyond what I would expect to receive elsewhere. If you are looking for a hands-on approach with your managed host, then Big Scoots is the best team for you! Harrison Wicker The team at BigScoots do a great job at the two things I care about most: keeping my site online and responding quickly (and kindly!) to support requests. They go above and beyond and I can’t recommend them enough. I’ve been with them for years and I’m a fan! LaTisha D Styles latishastyles.com I moved to @BigScoots at your recommendation when my site started crashing with over 1000 visitors per day. They are the best!

Luke Bream, Valentte “Scott helped me believe and understand that you can scale a business and stay on WordPress and WooCommerce, and I’m so glad he did!” View the case study Casey Markee, Media Wyse “BigScoots is not a set-it-and-forget-it hosting provider. If something is not working as expected for clients, the team gets in there and provides me solutions without a runaround and often, without prompting. That’s sorely lacking with many other hosting providers these days.” View the case study The Coaching Toolbox, The Coaching Toolbox “Hosting with BigScoots is the best money I spend every month!” View the case study Cassidy Tuttle, Succulents and Sunshine “It was almost too good to be true.

I want to thank your support for there awesome services. Yesterday i became a client and within 2,5 hours i was ready to go… where it took me more then 1,5 week with an other hosting company. So thank you very much! Maurice Flinterman dierbewust.nl I absolutely LOVE BigScoots.  I switched hosts a while back because I wanted to be able to set a staging site for changes without downtime. ☺️ Their staff is so helpful and do all the hard stuff.  Making life so much easier for someone who isn’t very tech savvy.  I am pretty tech savvy, but some backend stuff is just so time consuming.  BigScoots solves all those problems with ease.  Thank you! 😃 Tasha Margette Stardust Gold Crochet The level of customer service is through the roof. Fantastic company. Christine Adrian Miller Season Two Taste The more practical hosting with better Cloudflare edge cache setups would be 
@BigScoots Ankit Chugh Best customer service of any host, ever! The performance of our site is amazing on Big Scoots as well. We’ve moved through 3-4 different hosts after the last several years and have always had negative experiences with our hosting (especially customer service on setup and if issues arise) until now. Scott & Justin worked on a Saturday and Sunday to make sure they met their commitment to us to get our site transitioned within 48 hours because they had quite a few transitions to do. Other hosts (including our previous one) would have just said, sorry we’re busy it’s going to take us a long time. Big Scoots is THE BEST! Russell Monson PrePear.com Hands down, the best hosting company I’ve ever worked with. Customer service is second to none. I recently had an issue with two websites and Justin was immediately able to find out what was going on and fix everything. If you’re looking for fast, reliable hosting and top-notch customer service, then I definitely recommend Big Scoots. Ashli Dawn I use @BigScoots and adore them! I moved to them from another host and they transferred my whole site for me in under an hour! My site got faster too and I pay under £10 per month. ImovedtoLDN Can easily recommend @BigScoots for easy managed hosting. We’ve been with them happily for years now.
