Just set up my umami.is self-hosted analytics page. It took me less than 10 min to set up! Super simple!

Great Google Analytics alternative from @umami_software!

Umami (@umami_software) is my new go-to platform for analytics!

Fantastic open source product, privacy-focused, and they just released the most attractive pricing model out there for hosted analytics!

Umami should deserve more visibility

It's open source, GDPR compliant, and better than Google Analytics

Install it on @vercel, host database on @supabase and you have a complete analytics solution for your apps, for FREE.

Tried Umami today for a change. The simplicity is addictive 🙃. Good enough for me. Can't wait to integrate into my project.

Oh, and the API is as simple as the UI. Bye bye 46kb Google analytics script 😤🏃🏃 @umami_software 🤟🤟

On the weekend I set up umami.is to enable tracking that is not based on Google Analytics. It took only an hour. 👏

Thanks @umami_software for building it! 🙇‍♂️
