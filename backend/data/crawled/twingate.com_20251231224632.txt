They make zero trust easy and our users are loving the experience.” Luis Zaldivar SRE Manager “We got set up in literally 30 minutes and Twingate has easily scaled to manage our most complex workflows. Even our engineers love it - and that's a high bar.” Emery Wells CEO “Our old VPN was giving us serious issues and causing flaky Zoom calls with everyone working remotely. It drove me and my team crazy. Twingate couldn't come soon enough.” Christian Trummer CTO “We evaluated several competing vendors for zero trust and Twingate was clearly the easiest to deploy. We got Twingate up in minutes.” Paul Guthrie Information Security Officer “We've invested heavily in automation at Blend and Twingate is a powerful platform that allows us to programmatically deploy and maintain a zero trust approach to our infrastructure.” Cameron Perry Staff Site Reliability Engineer “I was waiting for the ball to drop, it was almost too easy. Twingate just worked like magic.” Neel Palrecha CTO “WFH made it clear that our old solution wasn't going to scale. We were surprised at how easy it was to get Twingate up, and we're excited to roll it out to the whole company.“ Joey Benamy Senior SRE Implementing and managing Twingate is a DevOps engineer's dream. From highly relevant and technical documentation to solid IaC providers… the team at Twingate have made it so easy to deploy and automate Twingate at any scale. Stuart Robinson CTO & Co-founder “When a product works, you don’t notice it — it just works. In the past, I’ve always known about when I’m on VPN because it’s annoying.

We got Twingate up in minutes.” andrew-fong CEO at Prodvana Twingate solved our production access problems in less than a day. We were able to get access to different k8s clusters in different VPCs without complex configurations. Getting that time back to focus on development was amazing. Twingate helped us set up least privilege access controls in a much more streamlined way than any of us were used to. The sigh of relief when we realized we didn’t need to configure anything else in GCP was palpable. :) They need to work on their marketing, but their product is phenomenal. If you are looking to ditch VPNs, check out Twingate. mang-git-ng CEO at Anvil Anvil just implemented Twingate to manage our remote access controls. Best / easiest 15min spent securing our systems. ian-calderbank Network Architecture Consultant Outbound tunnels only, no incoming attack surface exposed, tunnel stitching in their cloud, per device, per user and per application authorisation, integration with common major Identity providers, what's not to like. It took me 20 minutes to get it working for a sample SME (myself). Docker to deploy the connector to an on-prem box (a NAS), all autoconfigured once the necessary authorisation keys were pasted in. Microsoft 365 for the identity, Linux packages for the endpoint. Job done! u-nimajalali r/sysadmin contributor Twingate has massive flexibility when it comes to routing. You can route by IP or DNS. They even let you get down to the protocol and port level. Mostly overkill but could be useful in a bind with older networks and older systems. a-k-singh @itsatulkumar VPNs were good until Twingate arrived.

OncoLens is looking forward to getting more users and resources on Twingate and trying out the upcoming features on the roadmap! #devops #sase #zerotrust alex-bovee CEO at ConductorOne Push Verification and TOTP just aren’t good enough anymore. Webauthn / FIDO2 authenticators such as Yubikeys ( Yubico ) are the solve for phishing as they’re cryptographically verified against the issuing domain. They’re pretty close to perfect authenticators. The problem is that many existing tools, like VPNs, control the credential verification and depend on protocols such as RADIUS to authenticate users. This means Push and TOTP are the “best” multi-factor verification methods we have – but they are clearly vulnerable to at-scale phishing and social engineering attacks. There are companies that are solving this problem – Twingate and Tailscale are two great examples. They let you embrace both better credential verification natively and IdP led flows for authenticating users. All up, it’s scary to see the impact of the Uber hack, but I am optimistic that we’re making the right investments as an industry to help companies be more secure. robbert-r @RobbertR1971 Experimenting with Twingate in combination with a Pi clone. First impression is very good. What a relief compared to the setup of a regular VPN. erik-caligo ErikCaligo I've tried Twingate in my home lab, since I was fed up with the abysmal performance of VPN, and I must say, I was more than positively surprised by the performance. Even with a sketchy connection, I could work with Remote Desktop set at full quality. Furthermore, you can create security policies and device checks (e.g. only allow Windows machines that with enabled firewall, hard drive encryption, and antivirus installed), 2FA for every connection attempt, etc. You don't even have to open a port in your firewall for this, since you'll install a connector within your network that opens a secure outbound connection for which then is matched with the client outside your network. frank @CompWizard18219 Twingate works amazing.
