Dear cherished Vinglers,

First and foremost, we extend my heartfelt gratitude for the unwavering love and support you have given to Vingle over an extended period.

We announce a temporary suspension of Vingle's services effective from August 25, 2023, at 00:00 hours. During our preparation for the service transition, various issues arose. Instead of delivering a service that might not meet the expectations of our beloved Vinglers, we've decided to temporarily halt operations to reassess our situation and seek better solutions.

Please understand this is not a permanent farewell. Think of this period as Vingle's hibernation, a time for us to rejuvenate and return in a healthier and improved form.

Rest assured, every card you've lovingly crafted is safely stored. If you wish to back up the cards you've created, kindly reach out to support@vingle.net.

Backup request period: Until August 31, 2023
Backup request procedure: Send a request email to support@vingle.net using the email address registered with Vingle.

The Vingle team still holds dear the community we've built together. With hopes that when the frosty economic climate improves, we wish to preserve the possibility of awakening from this hibernation and eagerly resuming our journey. We ardently hope to overcome these challenging times together and await the day we reunite with each one of you.

Once again, dear Vinglers, thank you sincerely for your love and support for Vingle.

Warm regards,
Vingle Team.
