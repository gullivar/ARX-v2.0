Featured Ministry Compassion Works Ministry CWM is a "Forgiveness Advocacy" ministry. We believe that ALL are sinners (ROMANS- 3:23) & each of us are in need of God's complete and undeserved forgiveness. As Christians, yet sinners saved only by the sacrficial blood of our Savior Jesus Christ, we are obligated not to refuse others that very forgiveness  which is vital to renewed hope and in turn essential to overcoming a shameful past and opportunities for life change possibilities(Mark 11:26 kjv).

Prayer Request of the Hour Please pray for my husband Doug, he is in an alabama prison and we got word that he will be going to work release soon and this would be closer to home, his release date is in 2009, but we are praying for it sooner.
