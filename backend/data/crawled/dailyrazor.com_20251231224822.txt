I recently started using the opencart e-commerce application. PHP is new to me and I ran into numerous configuration issues getting the application up and running. I have been a happy Dailyrazor subscriber since 2007. My domain was located on a server that presented problems for the new PHP application. Christopher K, along with other team members including Max, Steve and Joseph S, migrated the entire domain to an updated server and walked me through the process of getting the app to configure correctly. Christopher K also set up my SSL certificate. I can't thank you guys enough. I know just enough code to get in trouble. You bailed me out every time. Thanks again, here's to the next 13 years! Christopher Tierney thevinylcanteen.com (formerly sciencelabwarehouse.com) Response from the owner: Hi Christopher, thank you for your wonderful review and for being with us since 2007! 🙏 We’re thrilled to hear that our technical team, including Christopher K, Max, Steve, and Joseph S, could assist with your OpenCart hosting, PHP setup, and SSL certificate.

When I first found about Dailyrazor, I was a bit skeptic about the cheap price/good quality combination.

Ibragim Hazred Dailyrazor is great and good web hosting provider. Thank to this web site I was able to created so nice web pages. Its very easy to use it and add pages, photos, articles... The servers are fast. I was put on a shared server with lots of load. I ask them if they would move my account to another server and they did it. You wan to see how fast their servers are? Just sign up and see how fast you get FTP and admin credentials sent to you. It's almost instantly. Since being with them I have found Dailyrazor to be a host I can recommend without reservation.

At DailyRazor LLC in Lanham, Maryland, we strive to provide reliable hosting and professional local support to all our clients. We truly appreciate your recommendation! Fritz Walter Compared to the others, Dailyrazor give more bang for the buck in their different hosting packages. Other companies limit how many domains you can use and then give you great amount of bandwidth... and everyone know that with most domains you won't be able to use that much bandwidth. It's like a popular internet provider offering 2000 hours of free use in a month. Sounds impressive but is unrealistic. Just as important Dailyrazor have good customer service. They are quick to resolve issues and patient when things are not easily understood. I really enjoy my hosting experience dealing with them. Response from the owner: Hi Fritz, thank you for your kind words! 🌟 We’re glad our flexible hosting packages and attentive support have made your experience seamless.
