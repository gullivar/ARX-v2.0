These agents were compared to all Zillow agent profiles for not subscribed to Zillow Showcase (“Non-Showcase Agents”) and matched during the "Matching Period", as defined below, based on the following attribute: (i) same team role; (ii) operate within the same market area; (iii) have similar average listing prices; (iv) similar listing count prior to Showcase Agents subscribing to Zillow Showcase; and (vi) similar listing trends prior to Showcase Agents subscribing to Zillow Showcase. These agents were also compared to "Less Frequent Showcase Agents", meaning agents with a Zillow Showcase subscription with less than fifty percent of all their listings on Zillow during the “Showcase Period”. The Matching Period consists of the year prior to an agent subscribing to Zillow Showcase. The Showcase Period consists of the sixty day period after an agent subscribes to Zillow Showcase. During the Showcase Period, agents with more than fifty percent of their listings on Zillow were then compared to both (i) Non-Showcase agent listings during the Matching Period, and (ii) Less Frequent Showcase Agents, at the time the listings went live in the MLS. *The data is from April 20th, 2025, and includes analysis on all Showcase agent subscribers that have been subscribers for sixty days. The data excludes all Showcase agents and Non-Showcase agents with significant change in market share. Additional tools for real estate heroes ShowingTime+ technology empowers you to be a hero.
