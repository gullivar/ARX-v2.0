“CrashPlan is a great solution for organizations with upwards of 100 users, that require granular control and detailed backup information, to ensure adherence with regulatory or compliance standards. A standout feature of CrashPlan is its ability to either backup data to CrashPlans’ Azure storage or for the customer to utilise their own storage and backup to AWS, Google or an on-premise server. “

Truly Enterprise-Class

“Being a Microsoft 365 customer, we were looking for an alternative that would help us leverage the petabytes of OneDrive storage we had at our disposal. Apart from allowing the usage of OneDrive as a backup vault, [CrashPlan] also solved several other issues that we were unable to get addressed with our previous solution. It is truly an enterprise-class product.”
