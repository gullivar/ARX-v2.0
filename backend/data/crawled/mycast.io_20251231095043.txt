This is called “fan casting” and allows movie buffs to use their creativity to choose who they’d like to see in a film adaptation of a story they’re already familiar with. There’s always that “next big movie” coming out in a couple years that hasn’t been cast yet. Everyone has their opinion on who would be the perfect person to play each character. myCast gives you a platform to make your voice heard! Make your suggestions, cast your vote, and see what others think! Dream Casting So maybe the film has already been made, but you think you could have cast it better. Wonder who would play each role in The Goonies if it was made today? Or who would play The Avengers if it was filmed thirty years ago? Or maybe you want to pick the cast of your favorite TV show if the genders were swapped. Use myCast to “dream” and assemble your dream cast for your favorite stories, even if they likely won’t be made. Imagine Casting Are you an author or screenwriter? We all like to imagine what our own stories would look like on the big screen. Use myCast to tell the world your story and who you think would play each character best. Or if you’d like, keep the story private and use it just for personal brainstorming. How to Use myCast First, find a story you’re familiar with. Start with something easy like Star Wars, or go directly to an obscure title with a niche fan base. If you can’t find the story you’re looking for (right now there’s 500,000+ and counting), don’t worry - you can add a new story. Just type in the title, upload a poster image, and let us know who the original creator of the story is. Next, browse the roles for the story. This includes all the characters in the story, but also crew positions like Director, Producer, and Writer. If you don’t see the role you’re looking for, you can add it. If you have an image or drawing of the character, upload that also! Finally, make some casting suggestions. Start typing the name of the actor or person you think is best for the role, and select their profile from the dropdown list. Once you make a suggestion, it’s open for other users to vote or comment on. May the best suggestion win! What is myCast? myCast is a platform that allows fans to suggest actors to play each role in their favorite stories. This is called “fan casting” and allows movie buffs to use their creativity to choose who they’d like to see in a film adaptation of a story they’re already familiar with. Is this for real? Fan casting is just for fun. The Hollywood studios are ultimately responsible for casting their films, but who knows? Maybe they’ll listen to what the fans want. It’s not uncommon for an actor to be officially cast for a role that was the top suggestion on myCast. How can I contribute? The myCast database is completely user-populated. That means everything - stories, characters, actors, and casting suggestions - are contributed by users. You can create a new story, populate it with characters, and make casting suggestions for each role. Then open it up to voting and comments! Do I have to create an account? You’re free to browse the database without an account. If you’d like to add any content or vote, you’ll need to create a FREE account. You can login using your Facebook or Google account if that’s easier. Can I edit my contributions? Yes, once you add a story, role, or suggestion, you’re free to edit it in the future. You can even archive the story to make it private or start from scratch if you’d like. What kind of content is allowed? We do not allow any content that contains hate speech or anything sexual or profane. Find something inaccurate? If you see something that needs fixing - like an outdated actor image or misspelling - let us know by clicking “Report an Error” at the bottom of the page. How can I advertise on myCast?
