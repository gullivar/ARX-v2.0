News, personal experiences, rumors and speculations about layoffs at your company

TheLayoff.com is live since January 31, 2009!

TheLayoff.com is a simple discussion board for all of us who would like to learn more about the rumors or possibility of job cuts in our company.

The workforce reduction process is inherently secretive and plagued with rumors. Companies release little or no details while planning such resource actions. On the other hand, the lives of each of us may be greatly impacted by these top-secret decisions - hence all the anxiety that workers may experience.

Enter TheLayoff.com - The purpose of this site is to provide a space for anyone who'd like to discuss the possibility, likelihood or impacts of layoffs in a company of interest.

To find your company's layoff discussion board please use the search tool. Alternatively you can drill down to each individual board via the A-B-C Index pages or popular links listed below.
