With fewer new features than introduced in previous updates, will Pigments 7 bring new colors to your productions? Written test Behringer Wave review Published on 12/18/25 The Wave is positioned as a faithful imitation of the PPG Wave 2.2 and 2.3 from the early 80s, at a very attractive price. While it copies their color codes and overall presentation, has it managed to retain their distinctive sound while improving on the uninviting ergonomics of the originals? Written test Native Instruments Absynth 6 review Published on 12/11/25 It's the archetype of virtual synths. More than 25 years after the first version and more than 16 years after the debut of version 5, Absynth finally returns with version 6. All the while, the competition has been busy. Does Absynth still have a place in a market that's more saturated than ever? Written test Roland TR-1000 review Published on 12/04/25 Roland drum machines have benefitted generations of musicians and producers. After years dominated by all-digital models, the TR-1000 marks a return to analog and has sent the small world of electronic music into a tizzy. Written test Arturia AstroLab 37 review Published on 11/27/25 Following the 61- and 88-key versions, Arturia now offers a 37-key version of its AstroLab performance keyboard. More compact, but just as smart, this new model promises to retain the strengths and philosophy of its predecessors in a format designed for the stage and on-the-go creation. Written test Cubase Pro 15 review Published on 11/21/25 Not a year goes by without a new version of Cubase, and it's only logical that v15 of Steinberg's flagship software should arrive. A beacon to light our night? Written test Yamaha MODX M review Published on 11/14/25 After the Montage M series was released at the end of 2023 through selected distributors, here comes a very affordable variation of Yamaha's big synth/workstation. Has the new MODX M retained most of its big brother's strengths? Written test Harley Benton DNAfx AmP20 review Published on 11/06/25 DNAfx products from German manufacturer Harley Benton include multi-effects and amp modelers. Up until now, the manufacturer has released pedalboards and headphone amps in this line (the DNAfx GiT, GiT Pro, GiT Core, and GiT Mobile), but has now added a small 20-watt combo, the DNAfx AmP 20, as well. Written test HEDD Type 20 MK2 review Published on 10/31/25 The HEDD brand is currently hitting the studio monitor market hard. With a bold design and high-precision technology in both speaker acoustics and DSP, the manufacturer is launching a new, highly promising version of the Type 20. Written test Mooer GS1000 multi-effects review Published on 10/24/25 The Mooer brand seems determined to make its mark in the arena of digital multieffects capable of cloning the gear of guitarists and bassists. In this review, we’ll find out what the GS1000 has to offer compared to its well-established competition.
