    The Parabola project is a community-driven, "labour-of-love" effort to maintain a 100% free
    ( as in: freedom ) operating
    system distribution that is lean, clean, and hackable. Based on the Arch distribution, Parabola is a complete, user-friendly operating system,
    suitable for general "everyday" use, while retaining Arch's "power-user" charm.
    Parabola adheres to the GNU Free
    System Distribution Guidelines (FSDG) ; which requires source code for every part of
    the system to be freely available, modifyable, and re-distributable.  All Parabola packages
    are built from source, in clean chroots, and with networking disabled, in order to replace
    any software and artworks in the standard Arch system which fall outside the GNU guidelines.
    LiveISOs, installers, and packages are provided for the armv7h, i686, and x86_64 CPU architectures. Our community is friendly and helpful.  Feel free to hop on the IRC channel , join the web forum , or subscribe to the mailing lists ,
    to get your feet wet. Once you are ready to begin your adventures through Fosstopia, the wiki will guide you well
    toward learning to install and use Parabola comfortably and confidently. Learn more... Latest News dovecot >= 2.4 requires manual intervention 2025-11-01 From Arch: The dovecot 2.4 release branch has made breaking changes which result
in it being incompatible with any <= 2.3 configuration file. Thus, the dovecot service will no longer be able to start until the
configuration file was migrated, requiring manual intervention. For guidance on the 2.3-to-2.4 migration, please refer to the
following upstream documentation: Upgrading Dovecot CE from 2.3 to 2.4 Furthermore, the dovecot 2.4 branch no longer supports their
replication feature, it was removed.
For users relying on the replication feature or who are unable to
perform the 2.4 migration right now, we provide alternative packages
available in [extra]: dovecot23 pigeonhole23 dovecot23-fts-elastic dovecot23-fts-xapian The dovecot 2.3 release branch is going to receive critical security
fixes from upstream until stated otherwise. 'zabbix' users: manual intervention may be required 2025-08-04 From Arch: Starting with 7.4.1-2 , the following Zabbix system user accounts (previously shipped by their related packages) will no longer be used. Instead, all Zabbix components will now rely on a shared zabbix user account (as originally intended by upstream and done by other distributions): zabbix-server zabbix-proxy zabbix-agent (also used by the zabbix-agent2 package) zabbix-web-service This shared zabbix user account is provided by the newly introduced zabbix-common split package, which is now a dependency for all relevant zabbix-* packages. The switch to the new user account is handled automatically for the corresponding main configuration files and systemd service … Manual intervention required for OpenRC 2025-07-15 OpenRC now requires services local , localmount and netmount to be added to runlevel default . This can be done with commands: rc-update add local default

Our wiki page has been updated to include information about it. i686 users - manual intervention required 2024-11-28 i686 users will probably be unable to upgrade, due to a problem with the latest archlinux32-keyring 20241114-1 the solution is posted on the bug tracker https://labs.parabola.nu/issues/3679 manual intervention required for local pacman repositories 2024-10-24 NOTE: pacman v7 is currently in [libre-testing]; but it will be promoted to libre soon from arch: With the release of [version 7.0.0] pacman has added support for
downloading packages as a separate user with dropped privileges. For users with local repos however this might imply that the download
user does not have access to the files in question, which can be fixed
by assigning the files and folder to the alpm group and ensuring the
executable bit ( +x ) is set on the folders in question. $ chown :alpm -R /path/to/local/repo Remember to [merge the .pacnew … Older News 2024-07-01 restart sshd immediately after upgrade 2024-05-24 pacman.conf and makepkg.conf changes 2024-03-29 [arch-announce] The xz package has been backdoored 2023-08-11 [From Arch]: budgie-desktop >= 10.7.2-6 update requires manual intervention 2023-06-19 OpenBLAS >= 0.3.23-2 update requires manual  intervention 2023-02-12 [From Arch] Switch to the base-devel meta package requires manual intervention 2022-11-06 systemd encrypted boot may be broken by upgrade to openssl v3 (systemd-cryptsetup), and various libcrypto.so.1.1 errors - suggest to postpone upgrading 2022-09-25 [From Arch] Removing python2 from the repositories 2022-08-30 Grub bootloader upgrade and configuration incompatibilities 2022-07-20 elogind requires manual intervention Package Search: Recent Updates ( more ) tmuxp 1.62.0-1 x86_64 qtile 0.34.1-1 x86_64 python-libtmux 0.53.0-1 x86_64 python-johnnycanencrypt 0.18.0-1 x86_64 freerdp 2:3.20.0-1 x86_64 faust 2.83.1-1 x86_64 dot-language-server 3.0.2-1 x86_64 desync 1.0.0-1 x86_64 deltachat-rpc-server 2.35.0-1 x86_64 alsa-utils 1.2.15.1-1 x86_64 alsa-ucm-conf 1.2.15.1-1 x86_64 alsa-tools 1.2.15-1 x86_64 alsa-lib 1.2.15.1-1 x86_64 lib32-alsa-lib 1.2.15.1-1 x86_64 zathura-pdf-poppler 0.3.4-1.0 i686 Documentation Wiki Installation Guide ARM Installation Guide Migration from other distros Support Bug Tracker Assist Mailing List IRC Channels Community Community Forum Reddit forum Free Culture Multimedia Comics Wallpapers Development Donate Development Mailing List Projects in Git Package Groups Todo Lists ISO Release List Visualizations Differences Reports People Hackers Support Staff Hacker Fellows Artists Signing Master Keys Mirror Network Mirror Status Mirrorlist Updater Mirror List More Resources Press Coverage News Archives RSS Feeds Friends of Freedom Copyright © 2009-2026 Parabola Project.
