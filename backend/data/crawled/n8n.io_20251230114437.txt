Build complex workflows that other tools can't. I used other tools before. I got to know the N8N and I say it properly: it is better to do everything on the n8n! Congratulations on your work, you are a star!

Igor Fediczko

@igordisco

Thank you to the n8n community. I did the beginners course and promptly took an automation WAY beyond my skill level.

Robin Tindall

@robm

n8n is a beast for automation. self-hosting and low-code make it a dev’s dream. if you’re not automating yet, you’re working too hard.

Anderoav

@Anderoav

I've said it many times. But I'll say it again. n8n is the GOAT. Anything is possible with n8n. You just need some technical knowledge + imagination. I'm actually looking to start a side project. Just to have an excuse to use n8n more 😅

Maxim Poulsen

@maximpoulsen

It blows my mind. I was hating on no-code tools my whole life, but n8n changed everything. Made a Slack agent that can basically do everything, in half an hour.

Felix Leber

@felixleber

I just have to say, n8n's integration with third-party services is absolutely mind-blowing. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for automation. So many tasks become a breeze, and I can quickly validate and implement my ideas without any hassle.

Nanbing

@1ronben

Found the holy grail of automation yesterday... Yesterday I tried n8n and it blew my mind 🤯 What would've taken me 3 days to code from scratch? Done in 2 hours. The best part? If you still want to get your hands dirty with code (because let's be honest, we developers can't help ourselves 😅), you can just drop in custom code nodes. Zero restrictions.

Francois Laßl

@francois-laßl

Anything is possible with n8n. I think @n8n_io Cloud version is great, they are doing amazing stuff and I love that everything is available to look at on Github.
