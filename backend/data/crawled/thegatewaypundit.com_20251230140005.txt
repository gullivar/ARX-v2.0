Proactive - Interviews for investors
ProPhase Labs announces LOI for reverse merger with Advanced Biological
ProPhase Labs CEO Ted Karkus joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce that the company has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) regarding a proposed reverse merger transaction with Advanced Biological Laboratories (ABL), a European biotechnology and MedTech group. Under the proposed structure, Advanced Biological would become the majority owner of the combined public entity, while ProPhase’s existing operations would continue as sister companies to a newly formed U.S. subsidiary expected to remain under ProPhase’s current management team. Karkus emphasized that the transaction remains subject to the execution of definitive agreements, regulatory approvals, and board authorization. However, the parties have discussed a preliminary, non-binding valuation framework that could imply an enterprise value of up to approximately US$30 million for ProPhase’s legacy business. This framework is intended to provide a basis for ongoing negotiations rather than a final valuation. As outlined in the LOI, and subject to applicable law and final documentation, ProPhase Labs may declare a special cash dividend of up to US$10 million payable to shareholders of record on a date to be determined. Importantly, any such dividend would be distributed separately and would not be part of the merged operating company. In addition, all Crown Medical Collections receivables are expected to be carved out and retained exclusively for the benefit of current ProPhase shareholders, further preserving value for existing investors. Advanced Biological Laboratories would contribute its global biotechnology and MedTech infrastructure to the combined company, including advanced health data processing platforms, cloud-based computing capabilities, and access to international financing resources. The combination is intended to create a more diversified healthcare technology platform with expanded global reach, while allowing ProPhase to unlock value for shareholders through pote

DNC Won’t Release 2024 Election Losses Analysis
Andrew Walworth, Tom Bevan, and Carl Cannon discuss the decision by the Democratic National Committee to not release the long-awaited autopsy report on the 2024 election, and Judge Hanna C. Dugan of Wisconsin is convicted of obstructing federal immigration agents and helping a Mexican immigrant avoid capture outside her courtroom. Then, Presidential historian Tevi Troy joins the guys to remember the life and contribution of writer and editor Norman Podhoretz, the influential neoconservative who died this week at the age of 95. Then, they look at a new survey by the Manhattan Institute which looks at the change and continuity of attitudes within the Republican Party. Next, they discuss President Donald Trump’s announcement of plans to celebrate “Freedom 250” next year, including a state fair on the national mall, a UFC match on the grounds of the White House, and “The Patriot Games,” a sporting event which features the best two high school athletes from all 50 states and US territories. Then finally, the guys give up their “You Cannot Be Serious” stories for the week. Hosted by Simplecast, an AdsWizz company.

Turning Point USA’s America Fest
Andrew Walworth, Tom Bevan, and RCP White House Correspondent Phil Wegmann discuss Turning Point USA’s America Fest which wrapped up on Sunday, Vice President JD Vance’s comments this morning regarding Nick Fuentes, and whether Vance can hold together the Republican coalition. Also singer/songwriter Nicki Manaj addressed the Turning Point USA audience on the importance of free speech, while Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) told ABC News on Sunday that he does not believe Vance stands for the traditional Republican values of free trade, lower taxes and limited government. Next, they discuss Larry Kudlow’s remarks that the US economy could experience five percent growth rate in 2026, and whether such an improvement in the country’s economic fortunes could help the GOP retain control of the House in the midterms. And, they discuss the political fortunes of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), who announced her withdrawal from the New York governors race after President Trump did not endorse her. Also, CBS Editor in Chief Bari Weiss this weekend pulled a segment from 60 Minutes at the last minute, saying it lacked context. The reporter on the story, Sharyn Alfonsi has protested – saying that the segment was screened five times internally. Hosted by Simplecast, an AdsWizz company.
