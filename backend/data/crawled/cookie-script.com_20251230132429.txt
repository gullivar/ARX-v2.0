Charanjit S.
The product is easy to use. The flexibility provided by this tool's platform is excellent because it can be tailored to the needs of the organization.
Very useful!
Fabien A.
I use CookieScript for my website, and it works great. Especially with the new European regulations, which are more and more complicated, and difficult to set up and develop by coding.
Must have tool!
Freo B.
Very easy and spot-on, and I like how they give examples or templates of policies. The product is very easy to use and easy to create a template for different projects that needs cookie or gdpr settings.
Great Service
Serhii K.
CookieScript service is amazing! They have automatic cookie scanning with predefined cookie descriptions. It facilitates life in times! All my requests to the Support team were successfully solved.
