Make sure to add some reasonable content to your new page. 2 Now you should determine your js.org subdomain: either choose your username or the name of your repo according to the existing GitHub Pages URL (for http://foo.github.io/bar, either "foo.js.org" or "bar.js.org" would be possible). More details in the wiki . 3 Add a file named "CNAME" to your repo (in the "gh-pages" branch for project pages) with a single line matching the domain you have chosen (e.g. "foo.js.org" without quotes). If you face any problems, check out the section about Custom URLs at GitHub Pages Help. 4 To finish the procedure, make a pull request in our GitHub repository that adds your subdomain to the list of existing JS.ORG domains.
