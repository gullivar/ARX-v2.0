It will end the weekend with roughly $218 million at the domestic box office, and with another $542.7 million internationally, has amassed $760.4 million globally to date. With six other movies earning more than $10 million this weekend, this a strong weekend for the industry. More... Weekend predictions: Avatar stays top as Marty Supreme looks at surprise second place December 26, 2025 Avatar: Fire and Ash will continue its strong run at the box office this weekend, easily topping the chart, and amassing another $60 million or so—enough to take its domestic total to somewhere between $220 million and $230 million by the end of the weekend, according to our model. Marty Supreme is currently favorite to finish in a surprise second place. More... Holiday theater counts: Avatar fends off midweek newcomers to maintain its hold on the top spot December 24, 2025 As expected, Avatar: Fire and Ash dominated the weekend box office, igniting with more than $89 million in its opening outing. The film is poised to claim another weekend victory, even as a pair of newcomers arrive looking to chip away at Avatar’s box office haul. More... The Odyssey trailer December 22, 2025 Christopher Nolan ’s historical epic opens in theaters July 17. Full movie details. Odysseus, the legendary Greek king of Ithaca, has a long and perilous journey home following the Trojan War, including encounters with mythical beings such as the Cyclops Polyphemus, sirens, and the witch-goddess Circe, while attempting to reunite with his wife, Penelope. More... Weekend projections: Avatar delivers firepower on blockbuster weekend for new releases December 21, 2025 Avatar: Fire and Ash is delivering huge box office at premium sites this weekend as moviegoers arrive in droves for James Cameron ’s latest cinematic marvel. It’s hardly the only game in town though, as three other new wide releases make up the rest of the top 4, and Marty Sumpreme makes the top 10 while playing in just six theaters. More... The Numbers Business Report: the economics of a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal December 19, 2025 There’s no way to seasonally candy-coat this: 2025 has been a grueling year for the film business. Between the wildfires in January and the WBD/Netflix/Paramount showdown in December, we’ve faced a wave of uncertainty over nearly all aspects of the industry. Widespread layoffs have occurred as the studios seek to shore up their balance sheets. Business and politics have become inextricably linked. Advances in AI create headlines on a daily basis, with studios variously suing over alleged copyright infringement, licensing content for training, charging forward with bold AI plans, then retreating when those proved oversold. In turbulent times, we believe the kind of analysis we provide is more important than ever. This year in the Business Report , we’ve analyzed the challenges posed by changing theatrical windows, and looked at why feature film production has moved overseas, and what it would really take to bring it back, among many other things. This month, we look at what a Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. could cost movie theaters, depending on Netflix’s business priorities. More... Weekend predictions: Avatar fires up theaters with weekend headed to the 90s or 100s December 19, 2025 Avatar: Fire and Ash storms into theaters this weekend, and is a lock on top spot at the box office through the Holidays. With an emphasis on spectacle, we’re seeing huge sales of premium tickets for the movie, and the seasonal timing and lack of FOMO around potential spoilers or dramatic surprises means many people aren’t in a huge hurry to see the movie on opening weekend. What we’re seeing so far points towards a weekend between $90 million and $110 million, with our model landing on $95 million as of this morning. That will suit Fox/Disney just fine. With three other major releases— David , The Housemaid , and The SpongeBob Movie: Search for Squarepants —all likely to produce good opening numbers, it’ll be a busy weekend in movie theaters. More... Theater counts: Avatar: Fire and Ash ignites the big screen, launching in 3,800 theaters December 18, 2025 Zootopia 2 reclaimed the top spot at the weekend box office after yielding it to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 the previous weekend, outpacing the horror sequel by $6 million and surpassing $250 million domestically. Both films are expected to exit first-place contention this weekend, however, as a trio of new releases enters theaters—including the long-awaited Avatar: Fire and Ash . More... Weekend projections: Zootopia returns to the top of the chart as Ella McCay disappoints December 14, 2025 With Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 taking a predictably steep drop from its opening weekend, Zootopia 2 returns to top billing this weekend, in spite of a 39% drop of its own on its third weekend in theaters. Zootopia now stands at $259 million domestically, and a mighty $877.7 million internationally, for a global total of $1.136 billiion. That makes it the top global performer of the year for a US studio movie. More... Weekend predictions: Zootopia likely winner in last weekend before the Holiday rush December 12, 2025 Zootopia 2 is the clear favorite to come top at the box office this weekend, with Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 likely to take a steep fall from its $64-million opening last weekend. Wicked: For Good should land third, with Ella McCay (the only new release playing in over 2,000 theaters) and the re-released How the Grinch Stole Christmas looking likely to battle for fourth and fifth places.
