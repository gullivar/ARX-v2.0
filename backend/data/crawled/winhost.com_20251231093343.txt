I have yet to experience any significant down-time or problems. As soon as I saw that you custom built your control panel, I was like "oh yeah, these dudes know what the hell they are doing!" Matt P. I am super pleased with the ASP.net hosting service Winhost provides. It is exactly what I hoped it would be. If anything, it exceeds what is promised. The few times I have used the Winhost Support Department, the response has been both highly responsive and actually provided solutions to my problems. Lionell G. I am absolutely amazed by the level of customer service at Winhost. Your email replies are lightning fast and helpful, the website deployment worked almost immediately, the database restore was intuitive and easy, I can access the database through SQL Management Studio (which I really like), site speed is fast, and the price is as cheap as Linux hosting. Volker R. I really am impressed with Winhost services and will eventually move all my clients to your ASP.net hosting service. Thanks and GREAT JOB WELL DONE! Gregory P.
