How dns4me works Well that's simple, every device that connects to the internet has an IP address this is a set of numbers that tells other devices how to get hold of you, much like a postal address. All we do is tell other devices/websites that your IP address is one of ours making them think you're in a different location like a PO Box Is it fast? We only deal with some of the requests unlike a VPN So it's as fast as your internet can handle Is it legal? Yes using a Proxy or VPN service is perfectly legal. Is it safe? Because our proxy servers only proxy a very limited number of domains most of your data travels directly to your computer. We also don't log or track any requests your privacy is important to us.
