Our people-powered journalism cannot survive without you.
Our End-of-Year Campaign, our most important fundraiser of the year, is underway. Without your support, we simply won’t have the funding we need to maintain the level of reporting required to take on everything coming at us in 2026.




We cover stories and amplify voices that the corporate media never will. There’s only one reason we can do that: the financial support and stability provided by our readers. No ads. No paywall. No billionaires. We are beholden only to the common good. That’s what makes Common Dreams different.

Please make a tax-deductible year-end gift today and help us reach our make-or-break goal by December 31.

The Least Among Us: The Elemental Heart of the Story

This holiday season, writes John Pavlovitz, "it’s a Herculean task to let our hearts be light." Daily, we confront the afflictions of an impossibly dark time - the cruelties wrought by a vile assemblage of hacks, liars, racists, and sadists who delight in Christmas-decked thugs menacing brown people with, "YOU'RE GOING HO HO HOME." Instead, we celebrate the judges, artists, pastors, organizers, brave pols, and regular people, aka "Radical Left Scum," refusing to bow to fascism. Go towards the light, and fuck these people.
