Design Interactive Maps

Maps are great, but you know what's really cool? Linking your worldbuilding directly to a map! Or even linking maps to other maps, going from your world map all the way down to a city or a dungeon!

The maps feature will inspire you during the worldbuilding process, allowing you to quickly create articles you can flesh out later. Then, your readers and players can explore your world in an interactive way like never before!
