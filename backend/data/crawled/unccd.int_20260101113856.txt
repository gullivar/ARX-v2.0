The agreement was formalised at the seventh session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-7) during a signing ceremony between IUCN Director General, Grethel Aguilar, and UNCCD Executive Secretary, Yasmine Fouad.The MoU highlights the shared commitment of both organisations to accelerate action on land degradation, restoration of terrestrial ecosystems and drought, support Parties in achieving LDN, and advance NbS as central to sustainable development. The MoU will guide joint action on technical cooperation, policy dialogues, and knowledge exchange, while leveraging IUCN’s scientific expertise and global membership alongside UNCCD’s mandate as the sole legally binding international agreement on land. It also paves the way for joint initiatives around the upcoming 17th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP17), set to take place in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in late 2026. Dr. Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Director General, said: “This agreement reaffirms the strong partnership between IUCN and the UNCCD Secretariat at a critical moment for global land and climate action. By joining forces, we can better support governments, communities, and civil society in restoring degraded land, strengthening drought resilience, and safeguarding biodiversity. Together, we will ensure that Nature-based Solutions remain at the heart of global strategies to combat desertification and deliver benefits for people and nature alike.” Dr. Yasmine Fouad, UNCCD Executive Secretary, said: “This agreement comes at a pivotal moment for global land and climate action. As we move towards UNCCD COP17, countries need stronger partnerships to accelerate restoration, build drought resilience and achieve Land Degradation Neutrality. By deepening our collaboration with IUCN, we are bringing together science, policy expertise and community – driven knowledge to support Parties turn commitments into real progress on the ground. Together, we can scale solutions that restore degraded land, strengthen communities and safeguard the natural systems that sustain us all.“  Established in 1994, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is the sole legally binding international agreement linking environment and development to sustainable land management. It is the driving force behind Sustainable Development Goal 15 and Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). The UNCCD Secretariat acts as an advocate for land, ensuring land-related issues like LDN and drought resilience are put front and centre on the development agenda. The Secretariat champions healthy, productive and accessible land around the world by acting as a bridge between science and policy, providing access to the latest data and knowledge, and assisting the Conference of Parties (COP) and its subsidiary bodies. As a partner to the Convention since 2011, IUCN supports progress towards policies and programmes that deliver LDN through the application of Nature-based Solutions (NbS). IUCN has actively influenced the evolution of the Convention, including the development, adoption, and implementation of LDN. IUCN is also an institutional observer of the Science-Policy Interface (SPI) and was recently an observer on the Intergovernmental Working Group for the Midterm Evaluation of the UNCCD 2018–2030 Strategic Framework.  Guided by its Resolutions and Recommendations and consistent with its Programme, IUCN engages with the UNCCD by providing inputs on a variety of topics and priorities including restoration, grasslands and rangelands, governance and rights, gender mainstreaming, NbS, sustainable agriculture, water management, and drought. The UNCCD recognises NbS as one important  approach to achieving the Convention’s aims as well as the SGDs, as NbS can offer co-benefits including poverty reduction, food security, women's empowerment, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable management of natural resources, while also contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation by transforming degraded lands into carbon sinks.  Notes to editors For more information or to set up interviews, please contact: IUCN: press@iucn.org  UNCCD: press@unccd.int About IUCN IUCN is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations.

We unite governments, scientists, policymakers, private sector and communities around a shared vision and global action to restore and manage the world’s land for the sustainability of humanity and the planet. Much more than an international treaty signed by 197 Parties, UNCCD is a multilateral commitment to mitigating today’s impacts of land degradation and advancing tomorrow’s land stewardship in order to provide food, water, shelter and economic opportunity to all people in an equitable and inclusive manner. www.unccd.int A Moment of Recognition: UNCCD Executive Secretary Dr. Yasmine Fouad Awarded the Nobel Sustainability Medal 2025 The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is proud to celebrate a historic moment as its Executive Secretary, Dr. Yasmine Fouad, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Sustainability Medal by the Nobel Sustainability Trust, one of the world’s most distinguished recognitions for leadership in sustainability.This honor reflects more than two decades of Dr. Fouad’s contributions to environmental governance, climate resilience, and community-centered development across Africa, the Arab region, and the world. It also underscores the growing international appreciation for the work of the UNCCD, as land restoration, drought resilience, and sustainable livelihoods become increasingly central to global environmental and development agendas.From the beginning of her career, Dr. Fouad has been driven by a simple but powerful belief: sustainability must begin with people. Her journey has taken her from scientific research in Egypt’s most vulnerable communities, to leading global negotiations, to shaping national environmental policy as Egypt’s Minister of Environment. Throughout this path, she has consistently emphasized that land is not only an ecological asset, but the foundation of human dignity, stability, and opportunity.Her leadership has always been shaped by her human story as much as her professional achievements. She often recalls a moment at the 2018 UN Biodiversity Conference when one of her sons walked into the negotiation hall, approached the podium, and placed his hands on the gavel as delegates applauded. It was, she says, a reminder that while leaders negotiate for agreements, children negotiate for their future. This intergenerational sense of responsibility continues to define her approach to sustainability and diplomacy.Today, the world faces unprecedented pressures on land and water. A quarter of the planet’s land is degraded, droughts are intensifying, and millions of people are losing the resources they depend on. Under Dr. Fouad’s leadership, UNCCD has strengthened its efforts to reverse these trends by elevating land restoration as a pathway to resilience, by advancing more inclusive approaches to drought preparedness, and by ensuring that the voices of women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, and rural communities shape global action.Her tenure has also ushered in renewed momentum toward key global milestones. The Tafa’ul Process, inspired by the spirit of constructive optimism, is guiding a fresh dialogue on drought resilience. The upcoming COP17 in Mongolia is expected to deepen commitments to land stewardship, particularly as the world observes the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists in 2026.As she accepted the award, Dr. Fouad dedicated it to the women who rebuild their communities in silence, to the young people who refuse to inherit despair, to the workers who transform scarcity into creativity, and to the families who choose hope every day. Her words capture the heart of the UNCCD’s mission: that sustainability is not purely technical work, but work grounded in humanity, in livelihoods, in cultural heritage, and in the right of every person to thrive on healthy, productive land.Her recognition arrives at a pivotal moment for global environmental action. As the world seeks solutions that are equitable, resilient, and just, Dr. Fouad’s leadership offers a model of diplomacy that is principled, compassionate, and grounded in real-world experience. Her story is a reminder that environmental stewardship is not solely about restoring ecosystems, but about restoring hope and opportunity for communities everywhere.UNCCD extends its warmest congratulations to Dr. Yasmine Fouad for this extraordinary achievement. The Convention looks forward to continuing its work under her guidance as it supports countries and communities in building a more resilient, humane, and sustainable future.
