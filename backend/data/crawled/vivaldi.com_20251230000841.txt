Fighting for a better web

We’re not working at Vivaldi, we’re fighting.

Fighting for a better web than we have now.

We are fighting for an end to the stranglehold the tech giants have on the web.

We are fighting to end incessant pollution of the web, and civil discourse, for profit.

We are making Vivaldi because we love the web. And because we love the web, we fight to keep it for everyone.

Command Chains

Save time and boost productivity by building your own shortcuts, workflows and browser modes. Trigger a custom sequence of commands with a single keystroke or gesture.

Proton VPN for Vivaldi

With one-click activation, you get enhanced privacy protections and all the VPN functionality you need. Because privacy should always be simple.

Ad Blocker

Skip all those annoying ads that also slow you down. No ads, more speed.

I continue to be a happy @Vivaldi user, and this is a big reason why: they've committed to keeping generative AI out of the browser.

I am really happy with @vivaldibrowser. The new UI, icon looks great. The flexibility and customization options are infinite. You can literally make it your own replacing/repositioning each part of the content. The vivaldi community is top notch.

Your browser affects productivity! 🚀 Tried many, but Vivaldi wins.

✅ Workspaces + keybindings

I can't believe I didn't switch to @vivaldibrowser sooner 🤦‍♂️.

My overwhelmed tab brain has completely disappeared. 😌

How is anyone still using Chrome? Why?
