Today, everyone needs a website to find new customers, so I was also looking how I can have an own website. For me it was very important that it is affordable. I got offers from agencies for several thousand Euros, but that was just too expensive. I tried out different services and found hPage to be the best one. - Friedrich K., Freelancer I'm responsible for the website of our company and I found the hPage system great and easy to use. I hope they will implement more templates for our industry (chemical supplies) soon. The software itself is very efficient. - Yui S., Webmaster For our business, a reliable service is extremely important. We found that partner in hPage who were able to scale quickly to our growing demands. We are looking forward to continue working together with hPage. - Henric F., CEO I thought I'm already too old to create my own website, but it was really easy with hPage. At first it was all new to me but I got used to it very quickly. Now, I really enjoy working on my website. I'm proud I made it myself. - Anastasia S., Private Customer I'm Liz, a travel blogger.
