To facilitate diversion of cross-boundary passenger and vehicular movements during New Year's Eve and the New Year holidays, a consensus was reached by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government with the relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality to make the following special arrangements on New Year's Eve (December 31, 2025):

(1) Passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually close at 12 midnight, will operate overnight, providing round-the-clock services; and

(2) Passenger clearance service at the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at 12 midnight, will be extended to 2am the next day.

Residents affected by the Tai Po fire can attend any Immigration Office for application of relevant personal documents without the need of making an appointment. For the service scope, addresses and office hours of the offices, please click here.
