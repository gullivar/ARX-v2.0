Politics

In the wake of tragedy, it’s still business as usual for politicians and the media. And Albanese, most of all

It was inevitable that the Bondi atrocity would be exploited by the Coalition and the media. But that doesn’t mean the hitherto-dominant Anthony Albanese doesn’t have weaknesses.

Data centres are coming for what’s left of Australia’s green export superpower dream

Government, regulators tell charities to be ‘transparent’ when using data to target donors

Australia’s privacy regulator is ‘very concerned’ about findings from a Crikey investigation that charities are making it exceedingly difficult for individuals to know how their data is being used.

Andrew Hastie — Howard’s true heir — is the future of the LNP (sadly)

Political responses to the Port Arthur and Bondi massacres are wildly different — but unity is still possible

After the Port Arthur massacre, politicians of all stripes worked together — and fast. The ideological element of the Bondi shooting makes the need for collaboration even more urgent.

Australian media’s movers and shakers on the best journalism of the year, and savviest industry move

To round out the year, we asked 250 of the biggest names in media what stuck with them, whether it was the best journalism they’d consumed or the smartest move they’d seen.

Police scrutinise the movements of alleged Bondi Beach gunmen in lead-up to the attack

The accused gunmen of the Bondi Beach terror attack allegedly made pipe bombs, did tactical training in a rural area, and completed reconnaissance of their proposed attack site, according to information from a previously suppressed police statement.

Politics

Albanese’s ‘review’ of Bondi failings is straight from the Abbott playbook

A review by a security insider within the government isn’t good enough in the wake of the Bondi atrocity. Like Tony Abbott after the Lindt Cafe siege, Anthony Albanese just wants the issue to go away.

While news media shouts hate and anger, the community offers courage and care

‘Part of what the media has got wrong this time is the same thing it gets wrong every time: the elbowing demand to push cameras and microphones into a still-shocked community, insisting on being the mediator of their grief.’

 Christopher Warren

I’m a data scientist. Even I was surprised about how charities are using AI to ‘predict’ how Australians will act

13 million Australians donate to charities each year. Most of them have no idea they are being scored, labelled and targeted by the organisations to which they give.

Yes, there should be Bondi royal commission. It must focus on Home Affairs, our worst department

The Coalition is correct: we need a royal commission in the wake of the Bondi atrocity. And Home Affairs should be its main target — its constant failings may have contributed to this nightmare.
