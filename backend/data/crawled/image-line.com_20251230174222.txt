The new AI stem separation feature on FL Studio is fucking mind blowing. I can import any song and isolate it down to vocals, drum, guitar and bass with minimal digital artefacts.

FL Studio means everything to my production, from how I draw my notes in, how it sounds, how I layer my drums, how I mix everything, and most importantly, the finished product.
