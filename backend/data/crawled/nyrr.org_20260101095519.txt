Category STORIES Comfort Foods for Winter Running We have fully entered into the winter running season, with temperatures dipping well below freezing, and gloves and beanies becoming essential pieces for every training run. Winter can often zap motivation with early sunsets, icy conditions, and face-numbingly cold wind. But, as in all cases, food makes things feel better, so we asked NYRR staff members what they like to eat when the New York City winters are, in fact, bleeding them—à la Paul Simon.
