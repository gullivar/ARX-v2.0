Almost 25 years later, in 1895, two hunting buddies got the idea for magazine and soon published the first issue of Northwestern Field & Stream: A Journal of the Rifle, Gun, Rod and Camera. Two years, later the title was shorted simply to Field & Stream. The most recent chapter to the F&S story came in 2023, when, for the first time in the brand’s history, the media rights and licensing rights were all under one roof. While the magazine is still the heart and soul of the company, there are plenty of exciting things going on at F&S, including a line of fan merchandise, an upcoming country music festival, and a chain of hotels designed for hunters and anglers.
