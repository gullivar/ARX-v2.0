Here's what they said: L2 Lina, 23 I used to hop around random video chat sites just for fun, but it was always the same story. Spam, rude people, or just plain chaos. Thundr was different from the first chat. It felt safe and chill, like everyone there actually wanted to talk.

I’ve met people from all over. One night I was chatting with someone in Seoul about art, another time with a student in Italy practicing English. Now I actually have a few friends I check in with every week.

It’s refreshing to find an app that brings back the fun of meeting new people without all the toxic stuff that ruined the others. M1 Maddie, 19 Hi my name is Maddie, and I go to school at ASU. I’ve always been super private, so dating apps made me anxious. Thundr felt completely different. Just people who actually act like adults. The calm energy made it easy to open up.

I’m really into anime and usually nobody gets it, but on Thundr I met people who seriously know their stuff. We started chatting about soundtracks and favorite arcs, and now a few of us talk every day about life, school, and whatever show we’re watching. It feels like a real little community.

It’s not about swiping or performing, it’s just real conversations. Thundr feels safe, natural, and honestly better than any social app I’ve used. E2 Evan, 28 I honestly didn’t expect much when I tried Thundr. Every “safe chat” app promises the same thing but usually disappoints. This one actually works. The people feel real, and the conversations don’t feel forced.

I’ve met travelers, artists, and people just chilling late at night. One time I spent hours talking with someone about movie soundtracks, and it reminded me of what the internet used to feel like. Just open, random, but still respectful.

If you want to meet strangers without dealing with all the weirdness of other apps, Thundr is it. It just feels human. A2 Amy, 25 I’ve tried way too many random chat apps over the years. Most of them felt sketchy or full of people who clearly shouldn’t be there. Thundr was the first one that actually felt calm and safe. My first chat went smoothly, like talking to someone who actually wanted to connect.

I met James, this British guy who was funny, thoughtful, and just easy to talk to. We started with random topics, then ended up talking for hours about books, family, and travel. It didn’t feel like some forced app conversation.

What I loved most is that I never once felt uneasy. The app keeps things safe without ruining the vibe. It’s not even a dating app, but somehow I ended up with one of the best connections I’ve ever had online. R3 Ryan, 32 I’ve tried every random video chat app there is. Most of them are just filled with bots or people being weird. Thundr was honestly the first one that made me relax. It’s clean, quick, and the people are actually interesting.

It’s become my go-to way to unwind after work. I’ll grab a drink, open the app, and somehow always end up in a great chat with someone new. There’s no pressure and no nonsense.

Thundr makes talking to new people online feel fun again. It’s simple but it works, and that’s why I keep coming back.
