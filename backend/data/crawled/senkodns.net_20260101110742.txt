More than four years on the market Frequently Asked Questions They were asked most often from our new users 0 1 🔥 What services do you offer? + We specialize in providing first-class virtual , game and dedicated server hosting in leading data centers around the world. We also offer other helpful services, such as domain registration and DNS hosting . Our virtual servers are versatile and suitable for all kinds of tasks: from VPNs and gaming projects to websites and databases — we can help you host any project. 0 2 🤓 What virtualization do you use? + For virtual server hosting, we use only KVM in virtualization. This ensures stable and fast operation of your servers, while also providing you with a fully isolated system and resources. 0 3 🌐 Are there any traffic limitations? + We offer unlimited traffic for all of our VPS/VDS plans, with a Fair Use Policy in place to ensure the stability of our network and prevent abuse. This policy is not overly restrictive , and under normal usage (under 100 TB per month or depending on the plan), you will have no issues whatsoever. However, in cases of excessive network traffic (inbound and outbound combined) usage, your server's speed may be temporarily limited (shaped) to 10 or 100 Mbps (depending on the plan) to maintain a stable network experience for all of our customers. Even after such speed limitation, your server's traffic will remain unlimited. The Fair Use Policy is designed to balance resource availability for all users while allowing you to enjoy the full benefits of our service. 0 4 🕒 Is a test period available for VPS? + We can offer a free one-time test server for any plan up to 8 vCPU with a test period of up to 3 days. To request a test server, create a support ticket through personal area and specify the plan, name and version of the desired operating system and the required period (up to 3 days). You will be able to keep the server (as well as its data and allocated IP address) after the end of the test period by just renewing it. 0 5 💵 What payment methods do you accept? + We accept payments from Visa , MasterCard and American Express debit/credit cards, including those issued in the European Union , Asia and North America . Payments are also accepted through Apple Pay , Google Pay and many popular cryptocurrencies such as USDT, TON, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero (and many others). 0 6 🕒 How long does server setup take? + Your server will be ready in just 120 seconds after payment! That's quicker than preparing a cup of tea or coffee (whichever is your favorite). In rare cases — for example, if you choose a Windows installation or the plan is in very high demand — the whole setup process may take up to 10 minutes after payment. 0 7 ⚡ Can I upgrade my server later? + Yes, you can upgrade your server's resources at any time through your personal area, by upgrading to a higher plan in the same lineup that your server is in. 0 8 🔒 Are outbound email ports closed? + To protect our IP addresses from spam and prevent spam in our network in general, outbound ports 25 (SMTP) and 465 (SMTPS) are initially closed on all plans. They cannot be opened for EP-0, PROMO-1, PROMO-2, PROMO-3, PROMO-4 plans (on any location). For other plans, you can request opening of ports 25 and/or 465 through a support request through the personal area — from our side, verification of usage requirements will also be required.
