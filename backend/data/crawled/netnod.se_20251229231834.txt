We provide robustness for digitalised organisations

We ensure a stable and secure internet across the Nordics and beyond by providing technology, expertise, and legislative insights to build a more resilient and robust internet.

Working for the good of the internet

As a neutral non profit our core goal is rock solid, a standard of robustness impossible within a commercial framework. We make profits to reinvest in our core mission – tech, knowledge and input on legislation to create robust organisations in Sweden and beyond.
