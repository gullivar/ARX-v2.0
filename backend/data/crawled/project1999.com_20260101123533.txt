Happy holidays! 16 Replies | 5,291 Views The Cracking of the Icestar - a Project 1999 Event! Dec 21, 2025 - 11:30 PM - by Medris Quote: They say the snow speaks, if you know how to listen. But lately... its gone quiet.  Watcher Aenwen, Plane of Snowdrift Norrathians, As the solstice draws near, old winds stir again! Snowdrift Elves have long been known to return each winter season, bringing cheer, unity, and strange gifts wrapped in magic. But this year, something feels different. Strange snowflakes are being found where snow should not fall. Ancient songs are missing their final verses. And those who look to the night sky claim to see a fracture among the stars. Could the source of the Snowdrift Elves power  the Icestar itself  be fading? Some believe this is merely superstition. Others say the Elves will return as they always have. But those who pay close attention can feel it: the cold has changed. You may want to prepare yourselves  not just for merriment, but for mystery. What to Expect: The return of the Snowdrift Elves, with their seasonal celebration and generous spirit. A new, lore-filled questline where players learn more about the Snowdrift Elves and strange artifacts that hint at a deeper truth, all in hopes of helping to restore the Icestar. Any character who completes this series will be entered into a raffle for one of three temporary titles per server! Seek out the elves' scholar for more information! Themed side quests and other fun around Norrath! Even in their time of need, the elves have once again been at work spreading cheer throughout Norrath. Holiday gifts have once again been hidden amongst non-trivial mobs, enabling players to share or open these magical gifts found across Norrath. But remember - the best gifts are those shared with others! Additionally, characters who have given away 10 more gifts to others than they have opened on their own will be entered for a chance at an additional temporary title per server. The snow begins to fall today, and will continue through late in the evening January 4th! When stars forget their light, who shall remember the cheer? Happy Holidays!
