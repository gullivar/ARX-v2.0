In a statement, the Maran district police headquarters said that the incident occurred due to soil settlement and movement at the base culvert section, resulting in damage to the road spanning approximately 30 metres in length, as Bernama reports. The statement added that the public works department (JKR) is presently carrying out repair works at the affected location to ensure the safety of road users. PDRM has advised motorists to use the Chenor-Gambang-Chini alternative route if necessary. 0 comments | Leave a comment? Perodua, already over capacity, considering buying Tan Chong’s Serendah plant for RM500 million – report In Cars , Local News , Perodua / by Jonathan James Tan / 30 December 2025 4:23 pm To jog your memory, Perodua Sales Sdn Bhd (PSSB) and Tan Chong Motor Assemblies Sdn Bhd (TCMA) last month signed a letter of intent (LOI) for the latter to provide electro-deposition coating and painting line services, as well as rental and use of certain designated assembly lines, for the Perodua QV-E . The Edge now reports, citing executives privy to the deal, that Perodua is considering buying Tan Chong’s Serendah plant – located just 3 km away from the former’s Sungai Choh base – for about RM500 million. “Perodua is leasing a capacity of 30,000 units per year at Tan Chong’s Serendah facility, which has a production capacity of around 40,000 units per year. It is also looking at the possibility of acquiring the Serendah plant,” one of the executives said, adding that the leasing deal is expected to contribute some RM80 million to Tan Chong. It would appear to be a win-win situation. Perodua is already operating beyond its maximum capacity of 320,000 units annually (its two plants – Perodua Manufacturing Sdn Bhd and Perodua Global Manufacturing Sdn Bhd – combined), while Tan Chong has been facing under-utilisation at its Serendah and Segambut plants, which have a combined capacity of 65,000 units a year, say research analysts. The Edge writes that according to a November 26 Kenanga Research report, Tan Chong has a 13% production capacity utilisation rate (8,450 units). Only 7,785 Nissans found Malaysian homes last year – TCMA Serendah currently assembles the Serena and Almera while TCMA Segambut makes the X-Trail , as well as non-Nissan vehicles such as the GAC GS3 Emzoom , GAC Emkoo and TQ Wuling Bingo . The Edge reports that Kenanga Research forecasts a RM185.5 million net loss for Tan Chong in FY2025 and a RM164.3 million net loss in FY2026, while RHB Research forecasts RM166 million and RM107 million respectively. In the first nine months of 2025, the company’s net loss shrunk to RM114.3 million from RM146.11 million in the same period last year, while its revenue increased 3.23% to RM1.62 billion. 2 comments | Leave a comment? AUDI E7X shown ahead of public debut at Auto China 2026 in Beijing – large electric SUV with up to 680 PS In Audi , Cars , International News / by Gerard Lye / 30 December 2025 3:37 pm AUDI, which is Audi’s China-exclusive sister brand, has unveiled its second production model called the E7X – the first was the E5 Sportback . Essentially the production version of the E SUV concept that was presented at this year’s Auto Guangzhou, the E7X will make its public debut in April next year at Auto China in Beijing. Retaining much of the design of the concept, the E7X is a large SUV that measures 5,049 mm long, 2,002 mm wide, 1,708 mm tall and has a wheelbase spanning 3,060 mm. Notable cues like the expressive ring lighting at the front and rear as well as the illuminated ‘AUDI’ script and corner headlamps at the front were all present on the concept. Other features making their way to production include the side cameras that replace traditional mirrors, a roof-mounted LiDAR sensor, the triangular motif for the front active grille shutter, flush pop-out door handles and eight-spoke alloys. According to Audi, the E7X will be offered with two powertrain options that pack system outputs of 408 PS (402 hp or 300 kW) and 680 PS (671 hp or 500 kW) respectively. No details related to range for now, but the concept is said to be equipped with a 109-kWh battery for up to 700 km following the CLTC standard. Other technical details of the concept include an 800-volt electrical architecture (dubbed ‘Advanced Digitised Platform’) that enables DC fast charging, with 320 km recoverable in just 10 minutes. There’s also the AUDI 360 Driving Assist System, which likely uses the LiDAR, cameras and other sensors to enable a relatively high degree of assisted/automated driving. Following its debut at next year’s Auto China, which takes place from April 24 to May 3, the E7X is scheduled to go on sale in China in the first half of 2026. 1 comment | Leave a comment? Xpeng P7+ updated for 2026 – global model going to 36 countries, Malaysia included? EV, REEV available In Cars , Local News , Xpeng / by Jonathan James Tan / 30 December 2025 2:30 pm Xpeng has announced that the global version of its 2026-update P7+ , which is about to go on sale in China very soon, will be sold in 36 countries. Not to be confused with the new second-gen P7 , the P7+ ( which was born in November 2024 ) is a larger and cheaper version of the P7i – itself a refreshed first-gen P7 . Confused? Never mind – let’s look at this latest update, which, Xpeng says, features over 104 upgrades. There are EV and range-extended (REEV) versions – according to Car News China , the former is a 800V machine with 5C charging (that’s 12 minutes to full), 245 or 313 PS, 61.7 or 74.9 kWh LFP batteries and a CLTC range as far as 725 km. Meanwhile, the REEV combines a 150 PS 1.5 turbo engine with a 245 PS electric motor and a 49.2 kWh battery to yield a 200 km/h top speed, a 430 km EV-only CLTC range (Xpeng says no other REEV sedan offers a longer pure electric range) and a colossal 1,550 km combined CLTC range. Top: 2026 Xpeng P7+ at dealers in China, photos reposted by Car News China from Yan Zhao Auto Bottom: 2025 Xpeng P7+ Length, width, height and wheelbase are 5,071 (+15 mm from before), 1,937, 1,512 and 3,000 mm respectively. How do you tell it apart from before? Firstly, the front LED strip is now in one piece instead of three. Secondly, there are new Y-shaped alloys, although they’re still 20 inchers. Thirdly, the front bumper has been slightly redesigned to incorporate an active air intake and a chrome splitter. Lastly, the rear is sharper, including a new tailgate, and the tail lamps now completely encircle the XPENG script in a trapezoidal shape. No more gloss black in the lower bumper, either. Inside, the side air vents are now hidden, the glove box now opens electrically and a new 29-inch augmented reality head-up display means the instrument panel can be made smaller (now measuring 8.8 inches versus 10.25 before). Old (left) and new interiors Carried over are the steering wheel, the centre console, the 15.6-inch touch-screen and the 20 speakers, although CNC says the new car also has a zero-gravity passenger seat, soft-close doors, active noise cancellation and microfibre headlining. It’s an Xpeng, so we can’t run away from advanced tech. The top variant will have three Turing AI chips that provide a combined 2,250 TOPS of computing power, making possible navigation on autopilot (both urban and highway). Will Malaysia be among the 36 countries getting this? We know the G6 SUV, X9 MPV and X9 PowerX REEV are coming as locally assembled (CKD) models , but we also know of “a first right of offer for the assembly of three subsequent Xpeng models (including D02 and D03)”, which online reports speculate to be future SUVs. Any chance D02 or D03 could instead be this? Nothing wrong with hoping! 1 comment | Leave a comment? China’s FAW Group purchases 5% stake in Leapmotor In Cars , FAW , International News , Leapmotor / by Gerard Lye / 30 December 2025 1:28 pm FAW Group has announced it is investing around 3.74 billion yuan (around RM2.16 billion) in Leapmotor. This comes after both parties signed a domestic share subscription agreement on December 28, 2025, which will see Leapmotor issue nearly 75 million new shares to FAW’s subsidiary, FAW Equity Investment. With this, FAW Equity Investment will acquire a 5% equity in Leapmotor at a cost of approximately 50.03 yuan (RM28.95) per share, reports CarNewsChina . Meanwhile, the stake of Leapmotor founder Zhu Jiangming and his concert parties will drop to 22.6% from 23.8%. Leapmotor is already backed by Stellantis , with the latter acquiring a 20% stake in late 2023 to become the company’s second-largest shareholder. Following the deal with FAW Group, Stellantis’ equity will drop to 19%. At the same time, FAW Qixin Power and Leapmotor will collaborate on plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and range-extended electric (REEV) vehicles. In the first 11 months of 2025, Leapmotor’s deliveries reached 536,100 units, which represents a year-on-year increase of 114% – the company expects to hit 600,000 units for the full year. For 2026, the goal is one million units, while the larger target is four million units annually in 10 years’ time. 0 comments | Leave a comment? Labuan customs department seizes 55 vehicles worth RM7.12 million for abusing duty-free use conditions In Local News / by Anthony Lim / 30 December 2025 1:23 pm Over in Labuan, the customs department revealed that it seized 55 vehicles worth RM7.12 million, including taxes, following a series of enforcement operations held in Sabah and Sarawak from January to December 29 this year, Bernama reports. According to Labuan customs director Aspaila Ag Tuah, the operations targeted vehicle owners who violated conditions under Item 14 of the Customs Duties (Exemption) Order 2017. She said that under Item 14 of the order, vehicles purchased in duty-free islands such as Langkawi and Labuan can be brought into the Principal Customs Area (not duty-free islands) for up to 90 days in a calendar year. As you’d expect, abuse of this is what led to the action being taken. “Investigations found that these vehicles were brought into the Principal Customs Area using the exemption facilities, but were not returned to the duty-free islands after the allowed period,” she said, adding that all the seized vehicles, which included models such as the Toyota Alphard and Vellfire, Audi Q7 and Mini Cooper as well as various BMW and Mercedes-Benz models, were being investigated under Section 135(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1967. Upmarket vehicles weren’t the only ones on the seized list, with Toyota models such as the Fortuner, Vios, Avanza and Unser as well as cars such as the Nissan Sentra, Mitsubishi ASX as well as Peroduas on it, proving that gaming the system and avoiding excise duties isn’t just limited to supercars. From January 1 next year, the game gets even more interesting, at least for vehicles priced up the chain, as the government has announced a move to prevent high-net-worth individuals from abusing Langkawi and Labuan’s tax-free status to purchase luxury cars at lower prices, with a ceiling price of RM300,000 for tax exemptions for vehicles purchased in the duty-free islands. 1 comment | Leave a comment? TuneBoss releases Suzuki VStrom 250 upgrade ECU In Bike Parts and Accessories , Bikes / by Mohan K Ramanujam / 30 December 2025 12:22 pm In a world’s first, home grown Malaysian motorcycle performance parts maker TuneBoss released a standalone ECU for the Suzuki VStrom 250 SX. The TuneBoss ECU fits the ASEAN model variant VStrom 250 SX, sold in Malaysia from 2023. The ECU will give the VStrom 250 SX a boost of 1 hp and 0.3 Nm of torque, for the standard power curve. The impact of swapping in a TuneBoss will be most felt at between 4,000 to 8,500 rpm. A completely plug-and-play performance upgrade, the TuneBoss ECU directly replaces the original equipment ECU from Suzuki. This is unlike other products from the competition where the performance ECU is a piggy back unit that intercepts the signal from the motorcycle’s ECU. The TuneBoss ECU is fully programmable using an app on the rider’s smartphone and a Bluetooth connection. Two standard engine mappings are provided – for use with the stock airbag and with the airbox snorkel/intake hose removed. Should other performance items such as air filters, exhausts and cams be installed, the TuneBoss ECU is ready to accept dyno tuning. This is because the ECU is programmed for professional tuning of fuel and ignition curves (Stage2). Other features of the TuneBoss ECU are precise RPM limit setting, diagnostic feature, live data monitoring or data logging combined with GPS location, and an immobiliser function. For the advanced VStrom 250 SX engine modder, there is also the option of dual-injector control and electric-water pump control. Pricing for the TuneBoss Suzuki VStrom 250 SX ECU is RM829 for the Malaysian market from authorised TuneBoss dealers. Global release of the TuneBoss ECU is expected to be second quarter 2026. 1 comment | Leave a comment? Butterworth station RM30m upgrade to start early 2026 – improved waiting areas, multi-level lobby, escalators In Local News , Public Transport / by Jonathan James Tan / 30 December 2025 11:59 am It was reported last month that Keretapi Tanah Melayu’s (KTM) Butterworth station is set to get a RM30 million upgrade in an effort to turn Penang Sentral (located just a few hundred metres away) into Seberang Perai ‘s main transport hub. We now have more details thanks to Penang infrastructure, transport and digital committee chairman Zairil Khir Johari , as reported by Bernama . What’s proposed are the construction and improvement of waiting areas, a multi-level lobby, escalators, a drop-off zone and other supporting facilities. The upgrade’s design and planning began in January and were completed in July. The federal government will handle the tender process and construction is expected to start early next year. “Upgrading KTMB Butterworth will reinforce Seberang Perai’s role as a major mobility hub. Butterworth KTM Station is a key gateway for the electric train service (ETS), intercity trains and transit services . “Its integration with the public transport network, including the planned Penang LRT , is crucial to ensure smooth journeys,” Zairil said, adding that the upgrade will focus on physical connectivity, timetable coordination, ticketing and travel information integration, and transit-oriented development , among others. 0 comments | Leave a comment? Mercedes-Benz VLE set to debut on March 10, 2026 – electric van built on VAN.EA platform; luxury versions In Cars , International News , Mercedes-Benz / by Gerard Lye / 30 December 2025 11:23 am Mercedes-Benz has announced it will unveil the new VLE in Stuttgart on March 10, 2026. First previewed by the Vision V concept at this year’s Auto Shanghai, the VLE is set to be the first model to be built on the brand’s VAN.EA platform and be offered with a range of electric powertrains. Reports indicate the VLE will directly replace both the V-Class and EQV , with the German automaker describing the vehicle as one that brings together the best of two words: limousine-like ride and handling with MPV-style versatility. In its official release, Mercedes-Benz says the VLE can be equipped with up to eight seats and be configured to suit the different needs of customers, from families and leisure-active customers to exclusive shuttles. The Vision V showcased the versatility of the interior, which saw a lounge-like cabin replete with a 65-inch screen – this could be reserved for an even more luxurious and rumoured VLS. Based on the teaser attached to the release, the VLE’s exterior looks to remain true to the concept that previews it. Notable cues include star motifs integrated into the headlamps, a front light bar as well as a massive grille with a perforated insert. No details about powertrains for now, but the VAN.EA platform is said to feature 800-volt technology to enable DC fast charging. Single- and dual-motor setups are to be expected, along with a battery capacity in the realm of 116 kWh for a WLTP range of up to approximately 500 km.

LRT3 Shah Alam Line – update on operations expected in January, testing and evaluation on trains continue In Local News , Public Transport / by Anthony Lim / 30 December 2025 10:26 am Prasarana says that an update on the LRT3 Shah Alam Line is expected to be announced next month. This follows on the December 10 announcement that the rail project would not commence operations this year due to the need to resolve system stability and software issues that were still detected during the testing and commissioning (T&C) phase. Evaluation runs are still ongoing, according to Shah Alam Line operations head Mohd Ariffin Idris, with the rail project currently undergoing fault-free running (FFR) tests for each train, as Bernama reports. “We have 22 trains for the Shah Alam Line. Each train must undergo this test and is monitored by the land public transport agency (APAD). Three trains have reached the required distance, but they need to be re-evaluated as APAD will reassess the criteria that have been implemented,” he said. The rail line had originally been slated to start operations on September 30 , but in August it was announced that the project had been delayed. In November, the government was said to be keeping to its target of December 31 for the launch of the line, but it was then announced in December that operations would not begin this year. At that juncture, Prasarana CEO Amir Hamdan said that the official launch date for the Shah Alam Line would only be set after the testing and commissioning process has been completed. It was previously reported that the project is expected to be delayed until the second quarter of 2026 . 1 comment | Leave a comment? Instalment-based payment options may address issue of unpaid summonses, suggests road safety expert In Local News / by Gerard Lye / 30 December 2025 9:50 am A road safety expert has suggested instalment-based payment options as a way to address the persistent problem of unpaid summonses. Speaking to NST , Universiti Putra Malaysia Road Safety Research Centre head associate professor Dr Law Teik Hua said allowing motorists to pay fines in manageable instalments would directly address affordability issues, particularly among lower-income groups. “By providing standardised and widely announced instalment payments, we confront head-on the ability-to-pay issue. It converts a non-affordable lump sum into a manageable and consistent outlay,” he explained. “This approach says: we understand your financial constraints and will help you pay, but the commitment remains non-negotiable. It combines empathy with toughness, which is essential for effective enforcement,” he added. Law also noted that such a system must be paired with firm enforcement, which may include automatic penalties for defaulting such as freezing road tax or driving licence renewals. “The issue is also about enforcement. If actual punishment is absent, no rational person, regardless of income level, would feel compelled to pay. It becomes a form of lottery, where only the unluckiest end up paying,” he said, adding that inconsistent enforcement contributes to a culture in which fines are seen as optional. Law’s suggestion comes after it was reported that the road transport department managed to collect RM93.51 million in outstanding summonses from motorists since a 50% discount was offered from November 1, 2025. However, this represents just a small fraction of the RM1.42 billion in outstanding summonses still owed. 2 comments | Leave a comment? Lamborghini Huracan seized by JPJ under Ops Luxury – no road tax, no insurance, no front number plates In Cars , Lamborghini , Local News / by Jonathan James Tan / 30 December 2025 9:46 am The Selangor road transport department (JPJ Selangor) has seized a Lamborghini Huracan under its ongoing Ops Luxury for having expired road tax, no insurance and no front number plates. The car is currently impounded at the Ijok enforcement station. “JPJ Selangor continuously monitors all complaints to ensure that vehicles always comply with the established road rules and laws. The public can report any traffic violation to [email protected] or the e-aduan application platform ,” JPJ Selangor said in a Facebook post . Since Ops Luxury was launched on July 1 , JPJ has seized 915 luxury vehicles nationwide, including Aston Martins, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches and Rolls-Royces, for various non-compliances including not having valid road tax and/or insurance, and number plate-related offences. 0 comments | Leave a comment? Goodbye KTM Ekspres Selatan – ETS takes over In Local News , Public Transport , Videos / by Jonathan James Tan / 29 December 2025 3:48 pm Railway enthusiasts are a nostalgic bunch, and now that Keretapi Tanah Melayu ‘s (KTM) Electric Train Service (ETS) goes all the way down to Johor Bahru , come January 1, we will bid farewell to the diesel-hauled Ekspres Selatan (Southern Express), which has ferried passengers between Gemas and Johor Bahru for nine years. Yup, another passenger train pulled by a locomotive bites the dust. The service used to be called Shuttle Selatan (Southern Shuttle), going between Gemas and Singapore’s Woodlands. Subsequently, Shuttle Tebrau became the only KTM train to Woodlands ( and even its days are numbered – as ETS put Ekspres Selatan to bed, RTS Link will retire Shuttle Tebrau ), and the long-distance southern service was truncated to JB. Once the six daily Ekspres Selatan services cease, there’ll only be one regular diesel-hauled express left in Malaysia – the Ekspres Rakyat Timuran , which will continue working the limited-stop service between JB and Tumpat via Gemas. The stopping trains here are of course the new-ish diesel multiple units (DMU), which are confined to the East Coast Line – these work between Gemas and Tumpat under the Shuttle Timuran (Eastern Shuttle) banner. “Every journey, memory and nostalgia with the Ekspres Selatan will always be engraved in the memory of all KTM employees. KTM would like to express its highest appreciation to all passengers and loyal users of the Ekspres Selatan for their continued support throughout,” said KTM chief technical officer and acting group CEO Ir Ahmad Nizam Mohamed Amin . 0 comments | Leave a comment? Trailer lorry swipes three cars parked on bend at R&R In Local News , Videos / by Jonathan James Tan / 29 December 2025 2:43 pm Watch the video above and you’ll see a trailer lorry, purportedly at the southbound Ayer Keroh R&R services, negotiating a rather tight turn, made tighter by some cars parked on the inside of the bend. The big rig swipes against the cars to get past, tearing off part of the front bumper of at least two of the cars. The comments section is buzzing, of course, with many criticising the cars for parking where they shouldn’t (not in a designated bay, on a bend and, some sources say, along an entrance meant for heavy vehicles) and noting that an insurance claim would be unsuccessful as a result. Still, some say it looks like the trailer lorry actually has enough room on the outside of the bend to clear the cars, while others bemoan the lack of parking spaces at highway R&Rs, especially during holidays. Regardless, this is a reminder to all of us to always give long vehicles a wide berth. Your thoughts? 4 comments | Leave a comment? Use only approved suppliers for chargers, ensure they comply with safety standards, Bomba tells EV owners In Local News / by Anthony Lim / 29 December 2025 2:41 pm The fire and rescue department (Bomba) has reminded electric vehicle (EV) users to ensure that the domestic EV chargers they install in their homes are sourced from approved suppliers and comply with established safety standards, The Star reports. The department’s director-general Datuk Seri Nor Hisham Mohammad said that charging equipment should come from suppliers recognised by the energy commission (ST) and meet specific standards to ensure safety. He said the installation of chargers must comply with MS IEC 61851 and MS IEC 62196 standards, and adherence to these standards, as regulated by the commission, are met. The reminder follows a recennt incident in which two EVs parked side-by-side in a car porch in Petaling Jaya caught fire and were gutted, damaging about 10% of the house as a result. The fire was successfully extinguished with water, and no injuries were reported. Nor Hisham said that based on preliminary findings, the vehicles were not being charged at the time of the fire. He added that despite speculation blaming the charger or ongoing charging, the fire occurred hours after charging had concluded. As for suitable guidelines, he said that current regulations remain focused mainly on public charging, and that any proposals for broader legal protections for EV chargers beyond that scope would need to be submitted under the National EV Steering Committee (JKK Pemandu) framework within the ministry of investment, trade and industry (MITI). Meanwhile, Malaysia Electric Vehicle Owners Club (MyEVOC) president Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi said the association has been actively engaging with the ST and Tenaga Nasional (TNB) as well as certified charging installation spe­­cialists to ensure that home charging is safe and accessible. “Following these engagement sessions, both the commis­sion and TNB have issued guidelines for home charger installations,” he said, urging EV owners to engage certified, professional installers and follow their recommendations carefully. “Companies and individuals listed as ‘competent persons’ by the commission can provide suitable recommendations on equipment and available power,” he explained. He also recommended that EV owners install smoke detectors near their domestic charging points and perform regular inspections, noting that wire connections can loosen over time, increasing the risk of overheating. He said that proper installation, monitoring and regular maintenance of equipment was the key to preventing accidents. 3 comments | Leave a comment? 1 2 3 … 4,039 Next → Sell your car to Carro !
