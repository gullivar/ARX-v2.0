So, you want to build a website…
Think all you need is content management and hosting?

This assumption causes serious problems down the road…

How you get a tangled mess
The reality is much more complex.

You need Ops—24x7 security, performance, scaling, and optimization.

You need a Workflow—So your designers, developers, and marketers can iterate together.

You need Governance—To manage and secure your portfolio of sites and users.

Doing this alone is just way too hard.

You’ll end up with a tangled mess. Think chaotic sprawl, inconsistent UX, poor performance, uninspired websites… and a team that struggles.

That’s where Pantheon comes in.
