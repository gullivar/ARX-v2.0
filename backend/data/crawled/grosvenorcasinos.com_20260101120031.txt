How To Play Casino Games Online

Our online casino is designed with you in mind. We have over 50 years’ experience in the gambling business, and we’ve used that knowledge and expertise to create an accessible website, filled with top-class online games. We’ve got something to suit every player and preference, as well as exclusive games you won’t find anywhere else.

Get started and create an account with us:

Click on the Sign-Up button in the top-right corner of the homepage. If you’re already a member of Grosvenor Casinos, then you can simply log in using the details you’ve already given us. Otherwise, you can register as a new customer.
Once your account is set up, you can take advantage of our welcome offers* and make your first deposit. Then you can play our online games whenever you choose.
Explore Our Online Casino Games

As one of the top UK casinos, we strive to offer a relaxed and welcoming environment. Whether you play at our UK land-based casinos, or are a new player, test your card skills and luck at table games, or you can embrace the authentic feeling of our casinos anywhere you go by trying our live games.

Our immersive tables bring a real casino experience direct to your chosen device and include a variety of classics, such as live blackjack, live baccarat, live roulette, and live poker, all presented to you in HD. Our live dealers and live hosts are always welcoming and happy to help, whether you’re playing online or using our app.

If you prefer classic table games, you can try your hand at baccarat, also known as Punto Banco, where you bet on the player’s or the dealer’s hand being closest to nine. You can challenge our dealers in blackjack by attempting to get closest to 21, or why not engage in the strategic play of poker.  While our variety of roulette games gives you that authentic casino experience.

Our collection of slots is packed with some of the most popular games available online. Whether you want to play classic and iconic slots like Starburst, Rainbow Riches, and Fluffy Favourites or try your hand at themed slots like The Goonies, it’s all ready and waiting. If you’re looking for something different, our Megaways casino slots are a super innovative type of slot. They each feature six reels, but the big difference between Megaways and Standard slots is that the number of symbols on each reel changes randomly with every spin. So, with each spin on a Megaways slot game, the number of paylines changes up to a whopping 117,649 ways to win.

And with our jackpot slots, prizes can be won every day. You’ll find fixed jackpots, progressive jackpots, Jackpot King games, and more. And the one thing that they all have in common? The chance to win some big prizes when you scoop up a jackpot.

If you’d like to experience the thrills of a real casino from the comfort of your own home, meanwhile, you can test yourself against our real-life dealers in our live casino.

What is the Difference Between an Online Casino and a Live Casino?

Our Live from Grosvenor category games are hosted by real dealers at Grosvenor Casino. The action is streamed to you live, in high definition, right to your smartphone, tablet, desktop or laptop. You can also interact with the dealer and the other players through the live chat option.

With online casino games, these are online versions of your favourite casino games, like blackjack or baccarat. There isn’t a live element, and the results of your bets are generated by a Random Number Generator (RNG).

Can you win real money playing at Grosvenor Casino?

Yes, it is possible to win real money when playing games available at Grosvenor Casino. We have a range of games to suit all budgets, including 10p Roulette.

Which Casino Games are the Most Popular?

At Grosvenor Casinos, we have hundreds of games for you to choose from. Whether you want to play live games, online slots, or try your hand in our online casino, we’ve got something for everyone to enjoy.

If you’d like to start with our most popular slots, poker, or online baccarat, you can easily find them under the Most Popular section on our homepage.

What is RTP?

RTP stands for ‘Return to Player’ and is a term that describes the potential chance that a player has of winning a prize when playing online slots. A higher RTP means that the slot has a higher chance of paying out, while a lower RTP means you have less chance of winning.

Say, for example, a slot has an RTP of 95%. This means in theory that it should pay out £95 for every £100 played. If you put £100 into an online slot with an RTP of 95%, there is no guarantee that you’ll win back £95. You should view RTP as a guide – in essence, if you play a slot with an RTP of 95%, you’re more likely to win than on a slot with an RTP of 85%.

The RTP percentage is an average calculated over a long period of plays, not each time the game or slot is played. The RTP percentage is generally measured between 10,000 and 100,000 plays or more to accommodate for bonuses and randomly activated features.

What payment methods can I use at Grosvenor Casino?

We offer a wide range of secure payment methods, including Visa and Mastercard as well as e-wallets like PayPal, Apple Pay and PaySafe Card. Rest assured, all transactions are 100% safe and secure.
