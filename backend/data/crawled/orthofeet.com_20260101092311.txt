I figured it was something I’d have to live with. After the first day wearing these the pain was virtually gone. After the first week the pain is completely gone!" Robert M. on Yari Hands-Free - Black/Gray "My feet hurt like you can’t even imagine. I have peripheral neuropathy, severe nerve damage, a torn ligament (which I refuse to have surgery on) and my left foot is splitting between my toes. Plus two hammer toes. These shoes are the closest thing to heaven I’ve ever found. The padding behind the straps were such a wonderful idea. Everything about these shoes are perfection. No matter what your pain issues are, these shoes will make your life so much easier." Shelly S. on Malibu - Brown "Love my blue Coral Stretch Knit sneakers. Fit is great, so supportive, no foot pain. Can wear them all day with confidence that my feet are in great care." Susan C. on Coral - Blue "These are amazing! I am recovering from Achilles Tendonitis and I needed both heel cushion and open back. These not only meet those objectives but they also look great!" Campion J. on Hudson - Black "I bought these shoes because I have bone spurs on my heels that are hitting my achilles tendon. I tried the Coral Sandy from Orthofeet and loved them from day one. They are so comfortable and my heels are still healing but the shoes feel amazing. Day one I thought , other shoes, you have to wear them in, but not these. They felt so good on day one and will continue to purchase shoes from Orthofeet. My foot doctor also recommended them." Cate J. "After enduring both plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis, I can confidently say that these slippers are wonderful! So comfortable that I can do household chores all day without any foot discomfort." Deb J. on Capri - Camel "Best boots I've ever had. I have arthritis in the ankles, knees, and a pinched nerve in the left ankle. Didn't have any pain at all!! Hiked all day for several days at Yellowstone and had no pain what so ever!!!!" Tonia P. on Dakota Waterproof - Blue "I was recently diagnosed with foot arthritis and it was a huge bummer, because I work outdoors and am on my feet constantly, and taking long walks is also my favorite way to decompress. Walking has obviously become painful… but not in these boots! There’s the perfect amount of room for my toes in the wide toe box and the support of the shoe is amazing. These boots are the comfiest shoes I’ve ever owned, and even better, they are waterproof and are cute enough to be worn with a casual outfit and not just on a walk/hike! Thank you so much, Orthofeet!" Mikayla B. "I love these shoes! I’m on my feet all day long at the hospital. These shoes help me walk pain free having Rheumatoid Arthritis it’s hard to find shoes that fit and comfortable. This is my 3rd pair I’ve bought from Orthofeet!!" Scott B. on Lincoln Center - Black "Finally, after years of searching for a comfortable shoe, this is it. I have had sport injury with badly recovered surgeries which caused a bunion on my left foot. This made it difficult to find comfortable fitting shoes. I bought this for a trip knowing I will be walking a lot. It was amazing after walking all day, my feet were not in pain. I never buy shoes on the internet and was surprised that this shoe fits to exact size. The lavender color is muted, which is perfect. I love this brand so much I am looking to buy a hiking boot for the mountain trails. Definitely recommend it." Attiana C. on Coral - Lavender "My feet kill me after working ten hours shifts mostly standing. These boots are amazing. They are the perfect width. They don't push in on my bunion. Love the box toe design. Plenty of room. I wish I could wear them even when I'm not working. They are more comfortable than my tennis shoes. I've looked for years and wasted hundreds of dollars trying to find a work boot that gives me some relief. Thank you!!" Brandon J. on Granite Work Boots - Black "Having a wide foot with bunions has limited me on the shoes and sandals I can wear. With these wonderfully comfortable sandals, I can walk all day without discomfort or pain. Since I often wear them when playing frisbee with my dog, they do get dusty, but they clean up easily with a wet cloth. These have become my go to footwear! Orthofeet - where have you been all my life! :-)" Shelly S. on Laguna - Blue "After I was diagnosed with diabetes and neuropathy I tried a pair of the work boots, and loved them. I recently bought a pair of the Ryder and cannot say how much they have helped. Both pairs of Orthofeet that I own are great. Highly recommend this brand to anyone suffering from foot pain." James W. on Ryder - Brown "I am so happy with my new Yari sneakers!!! I have extremely arthritic hips with pain most of the time. Now with Yari the pain is greatly reduced to even gone at times. I also have diabetes with my one arch so bad can’t sleep at night most of the time. Now with my add arch support the PAIN IS GONE!!!!!! Thank you soooooo much! I have now recommended 3 of my friends and they have ordered the same ones." Louis L. on Yari Hands-Free - Black/Gray "I bought these for my son-in-law who has diabetes. He just loves these. He says they are super "comfy cozy". After working all day on his feet, he loves coming home to these slippers. In fact, he says these are the BEST slippers I've ever bought him. (I tend to buy slippers as holiday gifts.) I'll absolutely buy these again for him, when they wear out." Lydia O. on Tuscany - Brown "I have been having so many problems with my feet, from arthritis pain in big toe from bunion surgery many years ago, flat feet and swollen feet. Thanks to Ortho Feet, I am able to walk without pain for the first time in over a year. I will be ordering more soon. Love, Love, Love. Thank you!" Janet H. "I've tried many pairs of shoes to use for working in retail walking around all day on concrete. These shoes are by far the best over the others. At the end of the work day, I usually have really bad back and knee issues. Now I don't nearly have as much pain as with previous shoes. When I was younger, I usually bought the cheapest shoes and now my 50 year old body is paying for it. If you think that these shoes might be a little pricey, they are worth it! I have narrow, flat feet and I use all of the supplied inserts." Richard M. on Edgewater - Black "I have very, very flat feet. Having had great success with several other styles of Orthofeet shoes, I decided to give these a try. Wow! At last, after all these years, I can comfortably wear sandals, all day long, and with no discomfort. A lot of thought seems to have gone into every detail. They are easy to adjust, easy to put on and remove but stay firmly in place. And they look great! Based on my past experience with Orthofeet shoes, I expect many years of great service out of these sandals. Highly recommended!" Dobbin C. on Gemini - Brown "My husband has hard to fit feet (8.5 EEE with very high instep) and is dealing with pain now due to gout, and none of the shoes he's worn in the past are comfortable anymore. I found OrthoFeet and hoped it might be a solution for him. These shoes were the ticket! The extra wide width, stretchy fabric, and laces for adjusting to his high instep was a winning combination. He said these were the most comfortable shoes he's every owned, and were comfortable right out of the box. He liked them so much, that I took advantage of the sale and got him another pair to put in the closet, since he goes through shoes like water. I so love the quality of these shoes, and really appreciate the customer service, since there were a pair we tried that didn't work that I needed to send back. The return process is so stress free, and I love how OrthoFeet stands behind their products. We will definitely be buying more in the future." Sue on Lava - Black "Loving my Coral Stretch Knit shoes! Since I’ve been dealing with pain from gout and other issues at the base of my big toes, I was desperate to find shoes that would ease my pain and put a bounce back in my step. The stretchy fabric and wider toe box enable me to move my toes with very little pressure in the sensitive area." Nadine M. on Coral - White "Love the Coral shoe. This is the second pair I have purchased to have a different color to enjoy. The shoes are the first I have tried with the orthotics and what a difference. I am 87 and now have feet with arthritis and also occasional gout flareups. The stretchy material is so comfortable and truly makes a difference. I no longer have to wear slippers to make my feet happy. Orthofeet is the only place where I will now purchase shoes from. Shipping is fast and know if there are any questions or concerns the customer service is very good." Nance N. on Coral - Turquoise "I had Haglund’s deformity surgery with Achilles repair last year. Since then I have experienced terrible nerve pain on the side of my foot. These shoes have helped tremendously in my mobility and have lessened the pain." Kevin on Yari Hands-Free - Gray "Recently diagnosed with Haglund's Deformity, Achilles tendonitis and a bone spur. I was off my ankle for 14 weeks. The doctor confined me to backless shoes and I could not find any shoes that were comfortable. It was like the glass slipper. When I slid my foot into the Clio it was such a relief to my foot and ankle. The foot bed was so comforting. It is due to these shoes that I am able to walk again." Alison M. "Almost one year ago, my husband and I went to Universal Studios Orlando and ended up leaving in a couple of hours because I just could not walk that much without pain. In June I had surgery for Haglund's Syndrome and then because of the weakness from the surgery, I sprained my ankle. I just spent two twelve hour days at Universal Studios and my feet felt great with my new OrthoFeet Verve's. I was really dreading what I figured would be another painful vacation, but OrthoFeet made it very enjoyable." Laura B. on Verve Tie-Less - Turquoise "So comfortable on my hurting left foot. I also got the arch support that goes in because that left foot has a collapsed arch. I love just sliding my foot right into it and not having to bend over and tie it. The size is perfect and my poor toes that are hammer toes fit beautifully and have room. I love it." Rene M. on Kita Hands-Free - Rose "Orthofeet shoes are the only shoes I can wear. I suffer from various foot problems. Bunions, hammer toe, weak ankle, overpronation and other issues. I have two pairs of the sneakers, a pair of sandals and the now these shoes. I love these shoes just like the rest of my shoes from Orthofeet. My next purchase will be a pair of ankle boots for fall/ winter months. These shoes have great arch support, looks great, no break in time and worth every penny. Oh yea they aren't a heavy shoe." Roz G. "I have been wearing these boots leading horses in an arena for about 4 hours once a week. I have hammer toes on both my feet and have had awful pain with my other boots. These boots are amazing, no more pain." Carolyn H. “Such a relief for my feet. I experience foot pain pretty constantly and have struggled to find shoes that would help me alleviate the pain. Well, I have to say that I have found them. They fit well. They have reduced my heel pain as well as my fasciitis symptoms. I can walk much easier and longer now...” Robert W. on Edgewater - Blue "I am very hard to please when it comes to shoes. I have wide feet and suffer with heel pain, chronic plantar fasciitis, and arthritis in my knees and lower back. My feet hurt all the time, and normally, when I wear any shoes they swell and ache so badly I am almost in tears. We are preparing to take a first time cruise and I wanted some shoes that I could wear that would not be terribly hot and would allow me the chance to do things without being in terrible pain. I saw these sandals offered, and kept coming back to them. I do not normally pay this amount for shoes, so it was hard, but I ordered them. When they arrived, I put them on and was shocked at how comfortable they were right out the box!! They do not rub anywhere! The foot bed feels so pleasant to my feet. After wearing them as is for a day or two, I then put in the included extra support piece and if perfection could be made better, that did it! I do not want to take them off, ever!! I am looking forward to my cruise, because I believe these shoes are going to be a game changer! I have told everyone about them, and I anticipate I will be ordering more of this shoe, and this brand. Having comfortable shoes is such a unique feeling for me..I cannot believe what I have missed out on!" Freida C. on Naxos - Black "I purchased these to wear while pregnant when bending over got to be too difficult. I needed a shoe with a good sole and support and I wasn't convinced other hands-free brands could give my feet what they really needed. I have plantar fasciitis and heel pain issues even when NOT pregnant. Let me tell you. These shoes have been AMAZING. The backs never fold. I've had really good luck loosening the laces as my feet swell." Emily on Kita Hands-Free - Black “Beyond satisfied with my purchase. I have suffered from plantar fasciitis and heel spurs for 2 years. Have tried everything from physical therapy, splints, braces, medications and to many shoes and inserts to name. …I ordered OrthroFeet out of desperation. The moment I put them on, I had relief. I was able to easily do two 12 hour days in the parks. I was beyond amazed and GRATEFUL.” Mary M. on Coral - Turquoise "I have a number of foot issues: plantar fasciitis, bone spurs, swelling ankles and feet, and gout. I always try on shoes and I find it difficult to find a shoe that accommodates all these conditions. I am truly enjoying my new great fit tennis shoes and looking to order another for workouts. And possibly a third pair for casual events. I think I can now have pain free days including standing for long periods of days. Definitely a relief." Gregory G. "Thank you so much for finally offering these in another color! I probably would have purchased any other color but am happy with the blue. I have hammertoes, bunions, bone spurs, you name it. These are the ONLY shoes I’ve found that that I can wear for hours at a time with ease and no pain." Dawn on Coral - Blue "I am recovering from a knee issue and it's difficult for me to bend. My husband suggested I splurge on these and it's the best idea he ever had! So much easier to put my shoes on. My feet slip right in with ease and they don't feel like they are going to fall off at all. Not to mention, they are super comfortable without any break in time. I didn't need to use any of the inserts as they fit perfectly but I will keep them in case I need them in the future for an extra boost. I also showed these to others at my Physical Therapy sessions and they were going to purchase them as well. I have a big test coming up soon - increasing my walking steps on vacation. I think I will be OK with these shoes. Orthofeet.com will be the first place I look going forward when I need new footwear." Diane L. on Kita Hands-Free - Rose 'I am on my feet a lot and the arthritis in both knees was almost unbearable but now, I have little to no pain. I know that I need knee replacements but until I decide to take that plunge, I'll continue to wear my OrthoFeet shoes. I love them and have recommended them to others." Brenda H. on Coral - Turquoise "This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned! I love that all three straps are adjustable for a perfect fit, and even though it doesn't have a heel strap, the shoe cupped my foot so there was no slippage, even going up and down stairs. I inserted the extra arch support and had no ankle or knee pain, even when walking long distances. As an extra bonus, it is also a very attractive and 'youthful' looking shoe. Love it!" Sharon "I bought the Orthofeet Lava's in the hope of getting rid of the metatarsalgia in my right foot that I developed walking for fitness in my hilly neighborhood while wearing high end cushioned running shoes from a major well respected brand. I had tried several over the counter orthotic inserts which failed to alleviate the problem. I should also mention that I have bunions and hammer toes, worse on the right foot and have a history of planta fasciitis. Right out of the box I was impressed about how sharp these shoes looked. Using the included optional arch supports I was able to walk pain free for the first time in months." George S. on Lava - Gray "I'd gotten to a point of not being able to be on my feet for any amount of time without excruciating pain. Even cleaning my house brought about so much pain, I could hardly walk. I was skeptical that any shoe could help me. I got these shoes on a Thurs and it took a few days for my feet to get used to proper alignment, but the following Monday, I went to the zoo with my granddaughters for the first time and walked over 4 hrs pain free. These shoes have literally changed my life!!! If you suffer with metatarsalgia or plantars... Please give these shoes a try!!! Thank you OrthoFeet!!!!! I'm amazed daily by these shoes and will absolutely order more!!" TRuss48 on Kita Hands-Free - Black "I have been rehabbing an ankle sprain on the left foot and metatarsalgia on the right. These new shoes are allowing my ankle sprain to finally recover by allowing full range of motion because they do not high tops. Pretty basic, but something I hadn't thought about. And most importantly my metatarsalgia pain is changing...for the better. I think it's going away and I've only had these for less than a month. They have made all this difference in the world and improved my quality of life." Tiali on Delta Waterproof - Black "Just diagnosed with a Morton’s neuroma which feels like I am walking in a pebble. These boots provided instant relief with proper arch support and warm comfort. Easy to get on and off. I bought them for a trip and they truly delivered. I didn’t have time to wear them in thankful that they were great from the get go. They look great on, quite stylish! Thankful!!!" Denise P. on Florence Waterproof - Black "My friend and podiatrist recommended these shoes. Upon arrival I immediately began wearing them. It’s been two weeks and my Morton’s neuroma is much better, almost like it isn’t there. My big toe on the same foot had been bothering as well. It hurt when I pushed through my stride. My gait wasn’t normal. The big toe is much better now and my gait is normal. My main cardio exercise is walking . I am much much less aware of my foot when I begin the long walks, which seems to be the most uncomfortable point in exercise routine. Good job Orthofeet." Robert C. on Edgewater - Black "I’m notoriously picky when it comes to shoes. I can’t tell you how many shoes I’ve bought and returned. Not only am I picky, but I have Morton’s neuroma. It makes finding comfortable shoes a real challenge. Fortunately, I found these shoes. They’re the only ones I wore on a recent trip where I did a lot of walking every day, and my feet felt just fine. I love that they come with great orthotic insoles. I usually have to buy some to put in shoes. I love these so much, I bought a pair in white. Plus a pair of leather high tops. Thank you Orthofeet!" Geri-Ann G. on Coral - Black "I have drop foot and neuropathy and have trouble walking. Since I got these boots I hardly take them off. My posture is better. My feet don't hurt. I can even walk up and down stairs better. In short, I think these boots are one of the wisest investments I've made in a long time. Thank you!!!!!!!" Albert S. on Hunter - Brown "Everything you said was true! It’s a gift for my feet and legs. Having multiple problems with neuropathy and fallen arches, these sandals are saving my life for the summer. I will be ordering another style come the Fall, for sure!" Elizabeth R. on Malibu - Black "My Granite work boots are the most comfortable shoes of any type that I own. I have neuropathy in my feet and they are a godsend. This is my second pair. The first pair held up well for 2 years. I will defintiely buy them again." James G. on Granite Work Boots - Camel "I suffer from overpronation of my ankle and plantar fasciitis and my home has hardwood floors. Every day was an agonizing existence until I found this life changing pair of house shoes. Thank you Orthofeet for making it possible for me to reclaim some mobility. Money well spent! Trust me Just get them." Michael C. on Asheville - Black "Problem feet? I have them. Both feet are flat due to plantar fasciatis in my 30's. Since then, I developed painful arthritis and bone spurs in both feet, but primarily the right foot. Custom orthotics have been a must for me for decades. My daughter asked for some Orthofeet boots for Christmas, and I couldn't believe the stylish shoes offered on the website. After reading reviews and doing some online research, I decided to try a couple pairs, especially since they offered a 60-day trial period. The Kita hands-free sneakers are a Godsend. I don't even need to wear my orthotics in them. I can walk mostly pain-free in my Kitas. So don't hesitate! Try them now! You'll be so glad you did." Carol A. on Kita Hands-Free - Black "These shoes are so easy to get on and off and are so comfortable. I am experiencing plantar fasciitis and these shoes are helping me so much with my healing process. My sister was having foot issue a few years ago and has been using Orthofeet for a long time. So I decided to get them and cannot live without them now. AWESOME." Charm D. "These boots are fabulous for my plantar fascilitis! I wore them all day at a conference, and my feet never hurt. Plus they are super cute - even my 14 year old complimented me on them!" Natalie on Emma - Black "Podiatrists Love These Comfy Sneakers That Are So Cute, You Won’t Believe They’re Orthotics" "When it comes to support, these slippers win the gold." “We rated them highly for their quality and responsiveness; they have a nice bounce when walking.” Why Orthofeet?
