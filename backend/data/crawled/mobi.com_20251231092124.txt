What mobile can be.

Mobi is still in beta testing right now. Can’t wait?

Just download the Mobi app and order your SIM card.
We’ll reach out as soon as a beta spot is ready for you.

We have one mobile plan. It‘s only $9.99 a month.

Everyone starts with unlimited talk, text,
and 1GB of high-speed data.

How the Mobi Plan Works
Additional Data Usage

Use as much data as you need
for just $3.99/GB.

Monthly Bill Flexibility

Limit how much data is used
whenever you want.

No Contract Needed

We don‘t want to trap you into a
contract. Stay because you want to.

We stay small so you save big.

We aim to be the most affordable mobile carrier out there, so we don’t spend a lot on marketing to help keep your wireless bill small.

Big carrier coverage.

You’re covered throughout Hawaiʻi and we partner with bigger carriers to bring you better nationwide coverage with reliable voice, text, and fast speeds just about everywhere you explore.

Care means everything to us.

The Mobi Care team is here to answer any questions you have along the way — just give us a call, send us a text, or email us for help.

You can even get 0% financing on a new phone if you’re looking to upgrade.

Take up to two years to pay and we'll cover the interest on your behalf — even if you decide to switch to another carrier.
