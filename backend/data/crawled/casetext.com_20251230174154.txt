Frequently asked questions
Does Thomson Reuters or its third parties retain user content or prompts to train their GenAI-based products or underlying large-language models (LLM)?

No. Your user content and prompts are not used to train or improve CoCounsel and associated products or LLMs, used in Thomson Reuters or third-party output, or stored by OpenAI or Google.

Thomson Reuters AI third-party partners, such as OpenAI and Google, are contractually prohibited from using any customer data to train their models. Additionally, where applicable, we have established systemic controls to turn off third parties' abuse-monitoring solutions to ensure there is no human access to Thomson Reuters customers' data or inclusion of that data in third-party models.

How long does Thomson Reuters retain user content and prompts?

Retention of user content and prompts is customized to fit customer needs and set up at the organization account level with the support of a Thomson Reuters client manager. We then delete user content and prompts in accordance with the customer's retention policy. Users can delete their content and prompts in the product at any time. 

How does Thomson Reuters protect user privacy and data?

All GenAI LLM requests originating from Thomson Reuters are processed under the identity "Thomson Reuters," never identifying the Thomson Reuters customer who made the request. We secure all data in transit via TLS 1.2, and symmetric encryption (AES-256) protects data at rest. All interactions with GenAI LLM providers use zero-retention API calls.

Where are user content and user prompts stored when retained?

Systematic procedures and hosting are in the U.S. We process all interactions with OpenAI GPT and Google Gemini in the U.S. We host backup data in separate availability time zones in the U.S.*

*Region-based hosting is available in the UK, Australia, and Canada.

What guardrails are in place to prevent bias in Thomson Reuters content?

We have developed and implemented prompting "guardrails," ensuring our GenAI-based products will only produce responses from content drawn from a clearly defined and limited set of verified information, such as our own content databases. This practice restricts the large language model's ability to produce potentially objectionable content broadly sourced from the internet.
