Distributed Processing

Automatically distribute processes across your network and in the cloud, utilizing thousands of idle cores without impacting your team’s current workflow.

Smart Caching

Integrate your compute grid with autonomous shared caching and network utilization to deliver faster iterations and feedback loops.

Pro-active Alerts

Gain actionable AI insights to seize acceleration opportunities throughout your code lifecycle.

Trusted by millions

Natively embedded in  Visual Studio since 2015

Seamless
integration
Install the Lightweight Agent

Add the Incredibuild agent to your machines to connect them into the cache and distribution grid.

Get Started
Run Your Builds

Execute your builds from with Incredibuild from Visual Studio, your existing CI tool, or directly from the command line.

That’s it!
Early Access
Going beyond build acceleration

Achieve constant health throughout your software development lifecycle with a unified observability view, powered by actionable AI insights.

JOIN THE WAITLIST
Build Autofix

Use AI to analyze your unique build history, instantly pinpointing the root cause of failures and suggesting the optimal fix.

Context-based Code Review

Go beyond static analysis. Use an AI reviewer to analyze your complete build data to identify performance bottlenecks and complex bugs that are invisible to other tools.

Build Guard

Go beyond code and artifact scanning by detecting build-time configuration drifts, malicious inputs, and supply chain attacks while ensuring SLSA and SBOM readiness

Accelerated Testing

Analyze historical build data to predict and run only the most relevant tests, leading to faster feedback, lower CI costs, and data-driven shipping confidence.

Works with your existing stack

Seamlessly integrate with the tools and technologies you already use
