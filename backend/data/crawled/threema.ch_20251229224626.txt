THE DANGERS OF CYBERATTACKS

Top executives and security experts rate cybercrime as the greatest current threat to companies worldwide. The threat landscape has intensified in 2024 and 2025, with new, sophisticated attack methods and increasing financial damages.

EVERY 16 MINUTES, A COMPANY IS HIT

In the second half of 2024, over 1,000 cyberattacks per week per company were recorded – a 30% increase compared to the previous year (Source: Check Point Research). Particularly at risk: the communications industry and critical infrastructures.

AROUND 10 TRILLION EUROS IN DAMAGE WORLDWIDE

Each data breach costs companies an average of USD 4.9 million today (Source: IBM). The global total damage could reach the 10-trillion mark by 2025.

GDPR VIOLATIONS ENDANGER 4% OF YOUR REVENUE

In 2023 and 2024 alone, the EU imposed over 4.5 billion euros in fines – including 1.3 billion euros for Meta (Source: Reuters). Companies risk up to 4% of their global revenue for violations.
