YES! Media Is Shifting Course!

With gratitude and hope, after nearly 30 years of uplifting voices and spotlighting solutions, YES! Media has shifted course. We ceased regular publication earlier this year. Gratefully, under the umbrella of The Truthout Center for Grassroots Journalism, our content archive lives on. Additionally, in September 2025, we launched a monthly YES! newsletter uplifting relevant pieces from our archives and new solutions journalism from other publications.

You can sign up for the monthly newsletter here, and view past newsletters here.

You can support these ongoing efforts here.

Subscribe to Rising Up With Sonali, the powerful show and newsletter hosted by Sonali Kolhatkar, previously YES!’s racial justice editor.

Read our full message about this transition, and special reflections from one of YES!’s founders:
