Store Management

This is Brilliant! As of writing this, I have over 1500 products with well over 75,000 variants in my store. Edit prices - add tags - setup sales with "compared to price" with the "sale price" and so much more! It's incredibly easy. Play with it, you'll figure it out.

This app is the bomb. So easy to use and great that I can decide how the button looks and where it is positioned on my product picture. So easy to set up on my Shopify store. Literally took me 5 minutes from install to video set up on a listing.

Merchant Review

Very impressive. I am using three of the push notifications after downloading the app. This is not the only app I use from this developer so when I saw their blurb for the app I had no reason to believe it would fail me. I am certain it will not fail you either.

Smart Push Marketing
Merchant Review

Very easy to use! I am just getting started and I have already collected so many emails and my sales have driven up for my bohemian and jewelry store.

Email Collection Bar
Merchant Review

This app can do so much more than you think at first glance! I would encourage all users to click through all of the combined conditions and see how many unique cases that this app can identify and create automation based off of!

Shop Workflow Automation
Merchant Review

Such an easy app to install and use. Not tech required... just plug and play and I can't believe how much of an increase in sales our store has had from the moment we installed.

Last Second Coupon
Merchant Review

Great cost-effective app for allowing customers in ANY country to see your products in their own country's currency. Excellent customer service, easy to set up. Highly recommended.

Multi Currency Converter
Merchant Review

Edit - 1 week later = 40% increase in revenue. I can hardly keep up! This is the first time I've offered free shipping and obviously customers love it. My conversion rates have increased by 5% also. Super awesome app!

We like what we are seeing on our Collection, Cart and Product pages. The Get-it-by timer, Stock inventory number and the Trust Badge have a minimalist look n' feel making it clean on our store.

Ultimate Sales Boost
Merchant Review

It works well. It is convenient to have the option to create a link, or not to create a link. It has a decent range of customisable fonts and styles. I like that you can select URLs on which you want the bar to appear, or to exclude it from appearing.

Quick Announcement Bar
Merchant Review

GREAT app! Super easy to set up and it looks great on both mobile and desktop. Customer service is off the hook (as the kids say) too! My questions were answered instantaneously through chat and when I wanted to make a change, they made it for me. Literally within seconds.

Countdown Timer Bar
Merchant Review

I have been using this app for roughly 2-3 months, and primarily for adding Alt Text and File Names to my products. It's a simple and powerful app, and I have no negative comments whatsoever.

Excellent translator, in a few minutes he translated me more than 300 products. I recommend it for anyone like me who needs a multi-language site.
