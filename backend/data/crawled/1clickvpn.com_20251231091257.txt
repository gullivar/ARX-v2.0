No registration required Free Download 4.6 Loved by 2M+ Users Download 1Click VPN today and enjoy private, fast, and secure browsing anywhere Edge Android Chrome Truly private VPN – no registration required Often when you use a Virtual Private Network, whether that be free or paid, the process involves setting up an account specific to you as a user. Normally, the process of setting up an account involves accepting terms and conditions. Hidden away in the small print, you’ll usually find that the VPN provider keeps logs of account holders’ IP addresses for a given length of time. This is not the case for 1ClickVPN, we don’t keep registration logs, and your use of the platform is truly anonymous. Just download one click VPN to your chrome and you are all set. Free Download Stream Your Favorite Shows from Anywhere With over 530 servers in 52 countries, 1ClickVPN is a truly global platform. Every virtual location is available to all users, letting you access geo-restricted websites from anywhere. Some TV shows stream only in the U.S., BBC iPlayer is blocked outside the UK, and even social media is restricted in some regions. With 1ClickVPN, you can reach your favorite content no matter where you are. Free Download Built with Privacy & Security in mind Avoid ISP Tracking ISP tracking means that your Internet Service Provider can monitor and record all your online activity – not just browsing history, but even communications via email or Facebook. But not behind 1click’s privacy shield. Undetected browsing Even if you browse using ‘incognito mode’, that only prevents cookies from being installed and stops your browser search history from being recorded. It doesn’t stop websites from tracking your IP address. 1Click VPN does just that, so you can browse truly undetected. No IP/DNS leaks A DNS leak is a security flaw that can happen with ‘split-tunnel’ VPNs, where traffic continues to pass over a local network interface, even when the VPN is active. That doesn’t happen when using 1clickVPN. Unblock Websites Certain websites can block traffic from geographical locations or even individual IP addresses. Accessing these sites from behind 1click’s server network gets around such restrictions. Unblock Streaming Heavy data users are often identified by ISPs and ‘throttles’ placed upon their internet speed. By using 1click VPN, this can’t happen, because your ISP doesn’t know who you are when using data from them. Encryption 1ClickVPN uses state-of-the-art zero trust algorithms and supports 256-bit encryption keeping your browsing secured. No Log policy 1click does not maintain the data logs of its users. We don’t provide a ‘back door’ to governments and don’t store your personal logs. VPN Kill Switch 1ClickVPN has a built-in VPN kill switch mechanism. So even though you might experience some disconnects, it just means that our kill switch is put into action.

IP geo location is the geographical location of a device based on its IP address. Many websites, ISPs, and online services use this information to provide region-specific content, enforce restrictions, or optimize user experiences. How does IP location work? IP location works by associating an IP address with a general geographic area using databases maintained by internet service providers (ISPs) and network registries like Maxmind or IPinfo. This data helps determine the IP’s approximate country, city, or region of a device. How can I find my public IP address? You can find your public IP address by searching “What is my IP?” in a search engine. Many websites also display your current IP address along with additional network details. Or if you visit 1ClickVPN your IP address will be shown at the top of the page, along with its detected country and VPN protection status. What is an IP address? An IP address is like your home address but for your device on the internet. It tells websites and online services where to send information, allowing your computer, phone, or other devices to connect and communicate over the internet.
