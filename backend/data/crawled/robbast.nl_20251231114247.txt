Rob Bast | Nerd for Hire Rob Bast “ nerd for hire ” I love a hands-on approach. Give me a keyboard and a task, and I will find a way to get it done, even if it is something completely new to me. Experienced with development in PHP, Javascript, Python and Erlang. Currently focused on CI/CD with Kubernetes on GCP/Azure. The internet has been my playground for well over a decade. For more details about my past experience, download my curriculum vitae . In my spare time I like to contribute to and collaborate on various open source projects. Have a look at my GitHub account.
