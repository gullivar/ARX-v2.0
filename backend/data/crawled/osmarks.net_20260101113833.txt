It must be at least a percent or so. 2025-11-29 I like how physically delivering this government project is an afterthought at the end of the description of what they're doing. 2025-11-29 Prank idea: secretly collect DNA samples from someone's dog, keep the DNA on file, use the DNA to make a clone upon the death of the original, and style the new dog to look like the original did in its youth. 2025-11-12 London currently has 2 Crossrails: Crossrail (Paddington/Liverpool Street) and Thameslink (St Pancras/London Bridge). However, there are 14 terminal stations, leaving us an entire 5 Crossrails short. I think every terminal should be paired with one on the opposite side of the city, with all trains rescheduled to run through to the other side.

More confusion. Somewhat worse performance. 4D Tic-Tac-Toe. Wave Function Collapse A basic implementation of the WFC procedural generation algorithm. Websocket Terminal Type websocket URLs in the top bar and hit enter; type messages in the bottom bar, and also hit enter. Probably useful for some weirdly designed websocket services.
