We Ran Testimonials as TV Ads. It Was a Really Good Idea.

Your customers are your best marketers. You can run the coolest, most engaging brand campaign, but sometimes nothing hits harder than hearing a real person talk about how your product made their life easier. That’s been our experience at MNTN, where we’ve been experimenting with testimonial ads on Connected TV. These ads let our customers […]

Small Change, Big Impact: How a Simple Creative Update Boosted Performance

Marketers are no stranger to being asked to do more with less — less budget, less time, less bandwidth. And yes, that includes us. Even at a CTV advertising company like MNTN, where testing is central to our strategy, resources aren’t infinite. That’s how we found ourselves with a campaign to launch and a promo […]

What We Learned From Running CTV Like Traditional TV

One of the things I love most about our marketing team here at MNTN is that we’re always testing — pushing our platform and generally seeing just how far we can take Connected TV advertising. If there’s a question worth exploring (and okay, some of them probably aren’t), we’ll roll up our sleeves and find […]

Brand & agency success stories

Affinity Federal Credit Union’s Year-End CTV Push Doubled Q1 Performance

Affinity Federal Credit Union is a customer-centric organization with a mission to improve the financial wellbeing of its members. They serve people across the nation, with branches and ATMs located throughout New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. With such an expansive geographic footprint to market across, Affinity was looking for an innovative way to drive new member acquisition and increase product adoption. Connected TV (CTV), with its powerful reach and performance capabilities, emerged as the ideal solution. Eager to gauge the channel’s strategic impact, Affinity turned to MNTN Performance TV to unlock the full potential of CTV. What they accomplished exceeded their expectations, especially after shifting their year-end strategy to extend their success into Q1. What started as testing a new digital channel, quickly evolved into an evergreen cornerstone of Affinity’s marketing mix.

Kane Footwear Hits Its Stride with MNTN, Delivering 250% Higher ROAS Than Goal

Kane Footwear creates active recovery-focused shoes designed to help athletes and active individuals recover faster and perform at their best. Built on science-backed design and sustainable materials, each pair features sole nodes that promote blood flow and a two-piece mold that allows feet to fully relax post-workout. As a growing brand, Kane sought an advertising solution that could scale with them — one that would introduce their innovative product to new audiences, differentiate them in a competitive athletic footwear market, and provide deep, transparent performance insights. Offering the reach of traditional television advertising and the powerful performance of digital platforms, Connected TV (CTV) emerged as the perfect channel for Kane to fuel business growth through brand storytelling. To ensure success on CTV, they turned to MNTN Performance TV.

Beddy’s Exceeds Holiday ROAS Goal by 150% With MNTN

Beddy’s was founded by two moms who struggled to get their kids to make their bunk beds. That everyday challenge sparked the creation of Beddy’s signature product: zipper bedding. Their innovative all-in-one bedding system goes over the mattresses like a fitted sheet, and zips together in just 10 seconds turning bed-making into an effortless task. As the original creators of this technology, Beddy’s essentially owns a market they built — but this also means they faced the challenge of educating consumers about a product category that didn’t previously exist. To address this, they needed an advertising solution that could effectively demonstrate their revolutionary product’s value while reaching new audiences and building brand loyalty. Visual storytelling through Connected TV (CTV) video advertising proved the perfect fit. MNTN Performance TV provided the precision targeting and consistent performance Beddy’s needed to drive growth on CTV throughout the year — and particularly during the critical Q4/winter holiday season when retail competition reaches its peak.

Your Performance TV Guide to Holiday Audiences 2025

Your Performance TV Guide to Back-to-School Creative 2025

The back-to-school season isn’t just about new notebooks and transitional style — it’s a marker of shifting consumer sentiment.
