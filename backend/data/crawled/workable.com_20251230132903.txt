Our take on HR software

At Workable, we believe HR software should work for you, not against you.

Here's what that means to us:

No smoke and mirrors

Most HR software vendors hide their pricing. We don't. It's right there on our website. Our trial isn't a neutered demo – it's our full product. We figure if we're not willing to be upfront before you buy, why would you trust us after?

Simplicity isn't simple

Our software feels easy because we've done the hard work. Under the hood, it's complex and powerful. But you don't need to know that. You just need to know it works. We use great design and AI to hide the complexity, not to dumb things down.

Software shouldn't be a second job

You've got enough on your plate. Your HR software shouldn't add to it. We've made sure Workable plugs into your existing tools, comes with expert support, and doesn't require a PhD to implement. Because your job is to run your business, not to become an expert in our software.

AI isn't the future, it's now

We're not just slapping an AI chatbot onto old software and calling it a day. We're baking AI into every part of Workable. It's there when you need it, doing the heavy lifting in the background. As AI evolves, so will Workable. We're committed to keeping you at the forefront of what's possible.

We solve real problems

Most HR software is full of features you'll never use. We focus on the stuff that actually moves the needle. More candidates. Less busywork. Real productivity gains. We're not here to give you a thousand buttons to push. We're here to solve your biggest HR headaches. The rest is just noise.
