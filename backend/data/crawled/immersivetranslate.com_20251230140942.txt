The first time I used this extension, I was blown away. It surpassed all other translation extensions I've used before. The segment-by-segment translation mode is innovative, offering bilingual comparison, and there are multiple styles for the translated text to choose from.

I have been looking for a Chrome extension to show both original and translated languages on the same page for dual language education purpose. I used Saladict for a few years but the versatility this extension provides is much more powerful. Thanks for making this!

If you: 1. Use Chrome; 2. Need to read a lot of English literature/PDFs/slides; 3. Are short on time or just want to skim; 4. Wish to have machine translation as a reference while conveniently browsing the original text, then anyone meeting at least two of these criteria should undoubtedly try this extension!
