General
Why should I compress my images for my website?

Optimizing your images with the TinyPNG algorithm brings several benefits to your website. 

TinyPNG reduces file sizes by up to 80% without sacrificing quality, leading to faster page loads. This optimization is essential for keeping user attention and ensuring an enjoyable user experience. Additionally, it minimizes bandwidth usage, making your website more efficient and cost-effective. 

Image compression also plays a role in SEO, as efficiently compressed images contribute to faster page speeds and improve your website's search engine ranking.

Does TinyPNG support WebP images?

Yes, TinyPNG supports WebP images. Our compression feature enables users to achieve the most optimal results when working with WebP files.

WebP, a web image file format created by Google, is supported by major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera. This format excels in achieving reduced file sizes while maintaining optimal image quality. Consequently, WebP images are smaller in size compared to PNG and JPEG counterparts, contributing to faster website loading times. This is particularly beneficial for your users, ensuring swift page load times and minimizing bandwidth costs, especially for mobile users.

It’s worth highlighting that despite WebP’s inherent size advantages, Tinify’s optimization can further decrease the file size. The intelligent algorithm ensures that there are no visible differences while more savings are made.

What does TinyPNG do?

TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your WEBP, AVIF, JPEG and PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!

What file formats does TinyPNG support for image compression?

Currently, Tinify supports AVIF, WebP, JPG, PNG and APNG (animated PNG). 

We are continuously working to expand our portfolio to include additional formats in the future.

Why do I get an optimized JPG when I upload a HEIC image?

HEIC is an image format that compresses photos very efficiently, but it is not widely supported by many other devices and platforms. To ensure your images work everywhere, TinyPNG automatically converts HEIC files to JPG, a widely accepted format.

If you prefer a next-gen format like AVIF, you can easily convert it with the online optimizer. Avif images offer better quality and smaller file sizes than other formats. The best format you choose depends on how you plan to use the images.

Is the privacy of my images ensured?

At Tinify, your privacy is our top priority. Rest assured, only you have access to the images you upload. We retain them for a maximum of 48 hours, after which they are permanently deleted.

For additional details on privacy, please refer to our Terms of Use, specifically sections 8 and 9. These sections provide comprehensive information on privacy policies and data processing operations.

Why did you create TinyPNG?

Panda says: Excellent question! We frequently use PNG images but were frustrated with the load times. We created TinyPNG in our quest to make our websites faster and more fun to use with the best compression.

In 2014 we added intelligent compression for JPEG images and in 2016 we added support for animated PNG. Compressing images with the website is free for everyone and we like to keep it that way! If you like TinyPNG please contribute by making a donation
