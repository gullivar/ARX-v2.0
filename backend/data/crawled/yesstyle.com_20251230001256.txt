Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser Jumbo
one of the most refreshing cleanser I ever used! it is so light and easy to use, perfet for all types of skin (of course my eldest one is using it, too) and ut cleans profoundly and deeply. I love its texture and the very light scent. Very recommended!

Calamine Pore Control Cleansing Oil
Really impressed with this product ✨ The texture is great, it feels comfortable on the skin, and the results speak for themselves. Easy to use, effective, and definitely worth trying. Added it to my routine and I’m loving

Bakuchiol Plumping Serum
I have been using this serum for a while, and it’s a really nice everyday serum. The texture is lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel sticky. The key ingredient is bakuchiol - a gentle plant-based alternative to retinol, which makes this serum suitable even for sensitive skin. I didn’t experience any irritation, redness or dryness. With regular use, my skin feels more hydrated, looks plumper, and overall more refreshed. It’s not an instant overnight miracle, but it’s a great option if you’re looking for a soft anti-aging effect and a stress-free skincare routine. I’d recommend using it consistently and always following up with a good moisturizer. Thanks!

The Juicy Lasting Tint Mini - 13 Colors
i got summer fig as a winter colour season and it's a perfect shade i wish they released it in the regular size as well😭its very buildable thanks to the light consistency and rather sheer formula but the staining power won't change depending on the amount applied which is something i like about romand lippies in general😌 if you liek fig fig or bare grape, i recommend that you try it out!!

Fruity Glam Tint Mini Duo Special Set - 6 Types
i bought these as new years gifts for my aunt and mom, who are both warm, and the vest part is they can buy the big size if they like it and if not, the products won't take up too much space. one thing i found surprising is that despite the mini size, these ones are round in comparison to the regular minis, which are in a a square shaped bottle instead. doesn't change anything practically, but i prefer the square over the circular packaging. love the formula as always, and the stain is top notch 💕🤭
