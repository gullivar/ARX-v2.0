"The problem with not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness.
Unless you’re so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain
suggests you’re a marginal company." PAUL GRAHAM Y Combinator

About.Us
We are THE leading boutique premium domain name brokerage, sales, and acquisitions firm globally. We specialize in professionalism and quality domains over quantity. We deal only in brandable and category-defining, premium exact match domain name acquisitions, and sales. You won't see us ever list subpar domains or digital properties. Quality is paramount or quantity!

Our track record of acquiring and brokering, premium domains, brandable domains, and websites for clients, has been tops in the world since inception. Our connections are deep, unsurpassed, and our closing abilities are unparalleled. Our contracts are modest, short, and simple, not ironclad, and unbearably long like others. What have we sold? We don't make it a thing to broadcast our sales. Most of our sales are NDA's, and we don't air them out of respect for our clients.

There are many brokers out there who will tie you up for six months or more, not do anything outbound because they already have a pile of premium listings and can't possibly give each the time and energy they deserve due to their limited resources. Most of the time they will poach your inbound leads, pressure you to sign for another six months to tie you up more, and then come in like vultures to try to buy your domain for way under value if it hasn't sold, much of which is due to lack of outbound coverage by them.

This tactic often leaves much thinking no one is willing to buy their name for asking or close to asking and often the seller will fall for this with their broker and end up leaving a ton of money on the table by selling it way to low or selling it to their broker! This is the equivalent of selling your new car back to the dealer as soon as you drive it off the lot! If you are a premium domain owner and this has happened to you, there are premium end-user buyers for your premium domain name, and no, it shouldn't take forever to find them!

We are experts in outbound brokering to end-users and experts on negotiating any domain that you wish to acquire! We won't stop until we have it purchased for you or the name you list with us sold! We limit our intake of premium domain names to focus on the premium inventory that we have. Each premium domain name takes a lot of dedication, hard work, and energy to find the right buyer. We're experts at that. Some names take longer than others, yes, and we are not guaranteeing your name will sell with us, but we are pledging to work harder on it than anyone else!

Have a premium domain that you would like to list with us, or maybe you would like us to acquire a domain name for you? Please get in touch with us. We offer the lowest rates in the industry for our acquisition and brokerage services, and we work harder than anyone. Quality leads, Quality domains, Quality transparent customer/client service is all we breathe!

Don't fall for other brokers who pretend to be pitching your names to end-users but in fact, are just pitching them to domainers or holding on and waiting until your contract is up and telling you that no one will give you your price, and then they low ball you and steal it from you. Yes, a lot of the so-called top brokers do this exactly, and that is how they have amassed their own giant portfolios! Don't fall prey to these opportunists! You're in honest safe hands with us as we never do that and never buy our clients names!
