FRAUDULENT USE OF THE FATF'S NAME

The FATF urges all to be vigilant against fraudulent use of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) name, logo or brand by criminals.  

Please do not transfer funds to anyone claiming to act on behalf of or to represent the FATF.

The FATF is a standards setter and assessment body. We do not:

make or authorise transfers of funds
ask anyone to pay fees for services such as recovering or moving funds or verifying the origin of funds
contact members of the public about financial transactions.

The FATF also does not have an investigative function, it does not get involved in individual cases and cannot seize or confiscate funds. 

If you have been a victim of fraud or have information about money laundering or other fraudulent activity, please contact your local law enforcement without delay.  

For further information please see our fraud warning at the bottom of this page.
