A Notice to Patients about the Oracle Health/Cerner Breach Notice of Data Breach Oracle Health, formerly Cerner, is an electronic health record vendor for many healthcare providers, including Baptist Health South Florida. On March 7, 2025, Baptist Health became aware that an unauthorized third party gained access to and obtained some of our patients’ protected health information, which was maintained on Oracle Health/Cerner systems. The vendor determined that their systems may have been compromised as early as January 22, 2025, affecting the information of many health care providers, including Baptist Health. The breach was limited to Oracle Health/Cerner systems. Baptist Health computer systems were not affected . The impacted information may have included social security numbers and information from patient medical records such as medical record numbers, doctors, diagnoses, medicines, test results, images, care and treatment. Federal law enforcement asked that affected organizations delay patient notification as they conducted their investigation. Affected individuals are now receiving notification letters and are being offered credit monitoring services at no charge. Individuals who have questions about the event may contact 833-931-5335 and provide engagement number B149213.
