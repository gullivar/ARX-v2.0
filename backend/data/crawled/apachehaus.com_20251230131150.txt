Welcome to the Apache Haus - Your place for the Apache Server and Modules on Windows
The Apache Haus is a community of webmasters, developers and hobbyists who prefer using the Apache Web Server over IIS. Whether for business or pleasure, the use of Apache on Windows is steadily gaining and we hope to see the trend continue by offering people a place to come where they can get help and share their experiences using Apache on Windows. Our forums provide the place for people to meet and ask questions or share their knowledge concerning the installation and operation of Apache, as well as helping them keep up to date with the latest technologies.

Please note that the Apache Haus is not affiliated with, or endorsed by, the Apache Software Foundation. The Apache HTTP Server, Apache, and the Apache feather logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.

Like stated before due to personal reasons our project is still on hold. For security reasons we removed the outdated httpd Apache versions. You can find 100% compatible versions at Apache Lounge who are our friends. We will keep the modules downloadable.
We keep you updated.
