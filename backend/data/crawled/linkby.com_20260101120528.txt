What is Linkby?

Linkby is a performance-based adtech platform that connects ecommerce brands with premium publishers to secure editorial coverage — with no upfront cost. Brands can launch campaigns on a cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-mille (CPM) basis if engaging with our Pubfeed product, paying only when their content drives real engagement.

‍

Through one simple brief, brands gain access to a global network of trusted media partners who create contextual, editorial-style content that aligns with their objectives, from product launches to sales activations.

‍

Unlike traditional advertising, Linkby is designed to deliver results, not just impressions. It’s built for brands that want reach, relevance, and return — all through one platform.

Who is Linkby best for?

Linkby is built for brands of all sizes — whether you’re launching a new product, running a promotion, or driving top-of-funnel brand awareness.

‍

If you want premium editorial coverage across trusted publishers, and only want to pay when your content performs, Linkby is for you.

How does Linkby work?

You start by submitting a campaign brief — whether it’s a product launch, sales push, or general brand awareness. You’ll choose your campaign objectives, preferred publishers, and market regions.

‍

Once a publisher opts in, they create editorial-style content that aligns with your brief. Campaigns can go live in as little as 48–72 hours, and you can track performance in real time through your Linkby dashboard.

‍

It’s a fast, flexible way to secure editorial coverage that drives results.

How much does Linkby cost?

Linkby’s Marketplace operates on a cost-per-click (CPC) model - you only pay when someone clicks through to your site from a publisher’s article. There are no subscriptions, sign-up fees, or upfront costs.

‍

Our recommended CPC is $2, with a platform minimum of $1 (note: rates can vary by market). You set your CPC and total budget upfront, so you're always in control of spend. Setting a higher CPC will naturally incentivise publishers to accept your campaign, especially if you operate in a competitive industry/sector.

‍

Each publisher sets a “minimum allocated budget” (typically between $2,500 and $10,000) - this is the maximum they can earn from your campaign, unless you decide to top up your original budget, which is a great option when performance is strong. You’re only charged for the actual number of clicks delivered, up to the allocated cap.

‍

For example, if a publisher delivers 100 clicks at $2, you pay $200. If you’ve approved a $2,500 cap and they deliver more clicks than that covers, you're still only charged the agreed cap.

‍

You can also split larger budgets across multiple publishers (e.g. $10,000 across two titles at $5,000 each), giving you flexibility.

How do I sign up?

Signing up is completely free and takes less than a minute. Just provide your name, company, industry, target markets, email, and password — and you’re in.

Brands can sign up here to explore the platform and start building campaigns.

Publishers can sign up here. Our expert Publishing team will then assess your suitability for the platform and get in touch to gather some more information/understand your objectives. Once your account is approved, you’re free to explore the platform and start receiving campaigns!

Are there any setup costs?

No! There are zero subscriptions, onboarding fees, or hidden costs — Linkby is entirely free to join for both brands and publishers. You only pay once your campaign goes live and starts delivering real results.

Can I choose which publishers I work with?

Yes — you have full control over which publishers receive your campaign brief.

‍

You can select multiple publishers for the same brief, and we recommend you choose those with the best audience fit for your product or service. Your Linkby rep can also help you refine your selections once the brief is submitted, based on what we know about your objectives and our team’s intimate knowledge of the publisher landscape.

‍

Publishers review briefs on a first-come, first-served basis, and can choose to accept, decline, or ignore a campaign. Once a publisher accepts, they're allocated your budget up to their set cap. If your campaign isn’t picked up, you can easily pitch additional publishers.

‍

We encourage brands to pitch multiple publishers to create urgency and competition. For example:

If you select 3 publishers and set a $5,000 budget, the first to accept can earn up to the full $5,000.

With a $10,000 budget, the first two to accept can each earn up to $5,000.

With $15,000, all three can participate.

You’ll be able to see a list of publishers during the campaign setup process.

How long does content take to go live?

Turnaround times vary based on the publisher but most content goes live within 48 hours to two weeks of campaign acceptance.

‍

Content tied to key moments — like product launches or seasonal sales — is often prioritized. Reviews or stories that require product sampling typically take longer, as publishers need time to receive and test your product before publishing.

‍

As soon as your content is live, we’ll send you an email with a direct link to view it.

We are an affiliate or affiliate network that would like to utilise Linkby. How do we get set up?

Our dedicated team is skilled in working with affiliates, affiliate networks, and agencies to ensure you gain the most out of the Linkby platform. The first step towards collaborating with us is scheduling a call with our team. We’re here to help you make the most out of all Linkby has to offer. You can book a time with our team here.

Can I book a demo or discovery call?

Yes! You can book a demo with our team to walk through the platform, ask questions, and get tailored advice on how to set up and optimize your first campaign.

‍

During the call, we’ll show you how Linkby works, explore what kind of coverage is best for your brand, and share best practices for driving success.

‍

Want to explore the platform first? You can also sign up for free and take a look around the platform at your own pace.

What protections are in place to prevent click fraud?

Linkby takes click quality seriously. We’ve invested heavily in proprietary systems to detect and filter out fraudulent, malicious, or automated traffic, so you only pay for clicks from real users. Our platform constantly monitors for irregular patterns — including excessive clicking or abnormal traffic spikes — and filters out anything that doesn’t meet our standards.

‍

At the same time, we understand that multiple clicks from the same user are often part of normal shopping behavior. Just like with Meta or Google ads, it's common for someone to click more than once before making a purchase decision. In many cases, this actually signals stronger intent and a user moving further down the funnel.

‍

It’s in our best interest — and our publishers’ — to deliver high-quality traffic that drives results. We proactively manage click quality behind the scenes, so you can stay focused on what matters: growing your brand.

‍

If anything ever looks off or you’d like help interpreting your campaign performance, your Linkby representative is always here to support you.

Can I track conversions within Linkby?

While Linkby doesn’t directly track conversions inside the platform (watch this space!), the platform integrates seamlessly with tools like Google Analytics.

‍

When setting up your campaign, simply enable the checkbox that says: “Use Linkby to add UTM tags to help you track delivery across individual publishers.”

‍

We’ll automatically append UTM parameters to your campaign URL, allowing you to track traffic and conversions from Linkby within Google Analytics — no manual setup required. If you pitch multiple publishers, we’ll also include a utm_content tag to help you differentiate traffic by publisher.

‍

You’re welcome to use your own UTM tags, but we strongly recommend using Linkby’s automated tagging. Otherwise, you may lose the ability to track performance by publisher.

Does Linkby help with SEO?

While Linkby isn’t designed solely as an SEO tool, being featured across reputable publications can create positive, long-lasting signals that support your broader SEO efforts in two key ways:

301 Redirects
All Linkby tracking links use 301 redirects, which help preserve PageRank and SEO value when linking from publisher sites to your brand’s website.

Increased Brand Signals & E-E-A-T
When high-authority publishers link to your site, it strengthens your brand’s credibility in the eyes of Google. These backlinks can help boost your Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) — all of which contribute to improved search rankings over time.

Do Linkby publishers use do-follow or no-follow links?

This varies by publisher and is entirely at their discretion. Most publishers use no-follow links, as major content management systems like WordPress default external links to no-follow for legal and editorial integrity reasons.

‍

Here’s the difference:

Do-follow links pass SEO value (known as “link juice”) from the publisher’s site to yours. These can directly support your site’s rankings in search engines.

No-follow links don’t pass SEO value in the same way, but they still offer strong visibility, referral traffic, and branding benefits — and are still crawled by search engines.

Linkby uses 301 redirects for tracking, which preserve SEO value when a publisher chooses to use do-follow links. So if a publisher allows it, your campaign can benefit from that SEO authority — but even with no-follow, the value in brand credibility, traffic, and exposure remains high.

How do I pay for a Linkby campaign?

Before your campaign can go live, we require a valid credit card to be added to your account.

‍

To do this, simply head to the Billing section of your Linkby dashboard and securely enter your card details. You only need to do this once — your card will be safely stored for future campaigns.

When will I be charged for activity?

You’ll be billed either when your total spend has exceeded the billing threshold of $500 (or equivalent in the market's local currency, such as £500 for campaigns running in the UK), or when a week has gone by since your last invoice — whichever comes first. Invoices are issued around midnight of each day and your credit card will be automatically charged when this happens.

‍

For example, if your campaign starts on Monday and drives $500 worth of clicks by Wednesday afternoon, your card will be charged on Thursday at midnight. If your campaign only drives $350 worth of clicks over the next 7 days, your next charge will happen the following Thursday.

‍

If you have any questions about billing or need help updating your payment details, your Linkby representative is happy to help.

What billing notifications will I receive?

You’ll automatically receive an email notification every time your card is charged for an active campaign. These billing emails are sent to the address listed under Settings > Billing Details > Billing Information.

‍

Want to loop in your finance team or someone else relevant? You can add additional billing contacts in the same section so they receive notifications, too.

Why is there a 20% VAT or 10% GST added to my invoice?

This markup reflects local tax laws in the markets where your campaign runs:

In the UK, a 20% VAT is applied to invoices for VAT-registered businesses, as required by law.

In Australia, a 10% GST is added in accordance with national tax regulations.

If you’re VAT exempt or believe your invoice needs updating, just reach out to your Linkby representative — we’ll make sure it gets sorted.

Can I pay via invoicing instead of a credit card?

Invoicing is only available for approved accounts, typically for brands running high-volume campaigns. If you'd prefer to be invoiced rather than use a credit card, speak with your Linkby representative. They can review your account and help determine if you're eligible for alternate billing arrangements.

Can I approve content before it goes live?

Much like a traditional PR placement, Linkby publishers retain full editorial control to craft content based on your brief, using their own house style to ensure it resonates with their audience.

‍

This editorial independence is critical to maintaining reader trust, which in turn drives better performance (content that feels authentic performs far better than advertorials!).

‍

That said, if a piece includes any factual inaccuracies (such as a spelling mistake or the use of an outdated product image), we’ll work with the publisher to ensure corrections are made quickly.

‍

If you're running a CPM campaign via Linkby Pubfeed, you do have the opportunity to review and approve content before it’s published. YourLinkby representative will share the draft for feedback once it’s ready.

Do publishers include a disclosure on Linkby content?

We recommend that publishers include a disclosure similar to what you might see on sponsored content, and most do so. The way this is communicated varies by publisher but typically appears as a short, italicised note at the top of content.

‍

This might look something like the below:

‍“We hope you love the products we recommend - our editors choose them independently. We may receive commission or revenue when you click the links or purchase a product.”

‍

‍This ensures transparency with readers while preserving the editorial feel of the content. Publishers are also responsible for ensuring that any disclosure meets relevant advertising and media compliance standards in their region.

Can I cancel or pause a campaign?

You’re free to make changes to your campaign before it’s accepted by one or more of the publishers it’s been pitched to.

‍

Once a campaign is accepted and/or content has gone live, you won’t be able to pause or cancel it. Publishers invest significant time and resources into producing content for your brand, and it’s important they have the opportunity to run the campaign through to completion.

‍

If you have a concern about a live campaign, your Linkby representative is always available to support.

What happens to the content once a campaign ends?

In most cases, the content created during your campaign will remain live on a publisher’s website even after your budget has been fully exhausted/your campaign ends. That means your brand can continue to benefit from ongoing visibility, organic discovery, and SEO value.

‍

That said, some publishers may make minor updates or changes once a campaign ends. For example:

Links may be swapped or removed as part of editorial housekeeping
Listicle placements may shift position if newer content is added

Full article removal is rarer, but may occur at a publisher’s discretion.
