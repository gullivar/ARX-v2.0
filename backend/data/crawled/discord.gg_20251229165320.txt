MAKE YOUR GROUP CHATS MORE FUN

Use custom emoji, stickers, soundboard effects and more to add your personality to your voice, video, or text chat. Set your avatar and a custom status, and write your own profile to show up in chat your way.

STREAM LIKE YOU’RE IN THE SAME ROOM

High quality and low latency streaming makes it feel like you're hanging out on the couch with friends while playing a game, watching shows, looking at photos, or idk doing homework or something.

HOP IN WHEN YOU'RE FREE, NO NEED TO CALL

Easily hop in and out of voice or text chats without having to call or invite anyone, so your party chat lasts before, during, and after your game session.

SEE WHO'S AROUND TO CHILL

See who's around, playing games, or just hanging out. For supported games, you can see what modes or characters your friends are playing and directly join up.

ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING TO DO TOGETHER

Watch videos, play built-in games, listen to music, or just scroll together and spam memes. Seamlessly text, call, video chat, and play games, all in one group chat.

WHEREVER YOU GAME, HANG OUT HERE

On your PC, phone, or console, you can still hang out on Discord. Easily switch between devices and use tools to manage multiple group chats with friends.

YOU CAN'T SCROLL ANYMORE.
BETTER GO CHAT.
