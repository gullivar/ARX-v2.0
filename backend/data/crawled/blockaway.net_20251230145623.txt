 The most advanced proxy site

BlockAway is a free proxy service that lets you access any website and keep your personal information anonymous. It overcomes various network restrictions, allowing you to watch YouTube videos and use social networks. Our goal is to make information more accessible for everyone.

 Why you need a proxy server

A proxy service acts as a mediator between your device and the Internet. It's straightforward to use – just enter the web address you want to visit. Your request passes through the proxy to the website, and the web content will return to you through the same proxy. This is beneficial if you want to:

Hide your network identity.
Keep your browsing history private.
Open inaccessible websites.

However, it's crucial to choose a reliable proxy service. Many on the internet are extremely slow, may disrupt websites and lack video streaming support.

BlockAway eliminates these limitations. It's a free and highly advanced proxy solution that can replace other web proxies or VPN services.

 What makes a good proxy browser?

When selecting the best proxy browser, consider the following criteria:

High-speed data transfer.
Anonymity and the ability to visit blocked websites.
Support for different types of websites without breaking or modifying content.
Additional advantages, such as faster processing due to proper caching and data compression.

This is a basic list of essential features to help you make the right proxy browser choice.

Of course, you can also opt for a VPN service as an alternative to a proxy site. However, many VPN services are paid and designed for professional usage. In comparison, BlockAway is free and doesn't require any configuration.
