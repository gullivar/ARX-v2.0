Why educators love Miacademy

A complete K–8 curriculum that grows with your child

Miacademy has over 80 courses—and we're always adding more. That means your child can keep learning and growing, year after year. Every course is written by a team of experienced educators, and includes videos, interactive practice, and assessments to measure your child’s progress.

Grades K-2
Grades 3-5
Grades 6-8

Building strong foundations

In grades K-2, students build foundational skills through hands-on learning. They develop early math concepts like counting, place value, and basic operations, while learning to read and write simple sentences. Science and social studies spark curiosity with topics like animals, weather, maps, and communities.

What our customers say about us
Jessica W.
Homeschooling used to feel intimidating, but Miacademy has made it easy and fun!

Our son is only 6, yet he’s ahead in every subject and is genuinely excited to learn. Best of all, he can learn everywhere we go since we’re a full time traveling family! We’ve never done public school and thanks to Miacademy, we never plan to.

Ana & Zoe
Whether you’re homeschooling full-time or just want a summer boost, Miacademy makes it easy.

I can assign lessons, track progress, and set her schedule through the parent portal.

The Stoffle Family
Having the flexibility to learn on the go—without sacrificing educational quality—makes it possible for them to chase their dreams while staying ahead in school.

At just 9 years old, Brody is the top-ranked Micro driver currently in the United States, and one of the most frequent questions we receive—both at the track and online—is “How does Brody keep up with school while racing at this level?”. Student-athletes like Brody rely on a strong academic program that’s not only effective but also enjoyable and adaptable to their demanding schedules. Miacademy empowers young champions to thrive both on the track and in the classroom, proving that academic success and athletic excellence can go hand in hand.
