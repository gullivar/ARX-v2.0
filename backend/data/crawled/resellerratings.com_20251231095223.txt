Need a book? Biblio will find it!
"I’ve used Biblio many times to search for books, including rare academic titles and popular literature. Their search engine is sophisticated, quick, and adaptable. Resellers are from diverse geographic areas. I couldn’t ask for more!"

Affliction Clothing
1/5
A complete and utter clusterf*ck of a company
"11/28 order 5 shirts for Christmas. 12/10 status hasn't changed. CS - backlog because of the Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale, wait till 12/18. 12/18 status hasn't changed. CS ask for an update, crickets. 12/20 CS ask for an update. 12/21 CS will notify shipping to expedite. Learn there's an OOS item, refund me for that item. 12/23 finally a shipping notice 12/30 arrived (not very expedited) 12/30 missing half the order At this point I don't care anymore. Send the missing shirts, refund the shirts. Never ever ever again."
