Life has almost disappeared while crowds of the living dead came to replace it destroying the civilization. Become one of the immortals, warriors, cursed by goddess Hell, and protect Midgard from the invasion of the dead. Unite with other vikings, enhance your camp, and start to raid neighbors. Build your own town and explore forgotten sanctums, and when the North is not enough — sail a drakkar to the new shores for untold riches! Sunday City is a city of eternal summer, luxury, and vivid impressions. Here, everyone can build a dazzling career, find new friends, and impress those around them with their individuality. Every step is a step toward real success, which awaits you on the cozy streets of Sunday City. We help you make games Games are our passion and our calling. They’re also entirely a team effort.
