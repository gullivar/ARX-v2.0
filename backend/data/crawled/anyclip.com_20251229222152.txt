By instantly activating the innate data in video with AI,
the power once reserved for text—transparency, interactivity and collaboration—is now available for the most desired and prevalent form of communication: video.

Leverage our proprietary Wildcard Model, built with the latest gen-AI technology. It accurately identifies actions, moments, location, and times within content, using custom taxonomies tailored to the industry’s specific needs.

Automatically centralize all your video content in one place streamlining video management, organization, hosting, and distribution.

Automate editorial workflows using the AI Workbench™, which generate description. chapters, translations, and more, driving connectivity, productivity, and collaboration.

Monetize content using contextually based metadata serving ads at relevant moments.

Drive content accessibility and personalization with a dynamic recommendation engine, in-video deep search, automatic highlights, and more.

As a broadcast news company, we have thousands of hours of video assets which can be hard to resurface, and time-consuming to create captivating user experiences. This leads to video content and revenue on the cutting room floor. Our partnership with AnyClip drove a 6X increase in engagement and 3X increase in revenue, all due to their contextual playlist and ad targeting capabilities.
