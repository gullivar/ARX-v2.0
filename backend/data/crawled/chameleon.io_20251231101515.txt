Startup fast. Security isn’t an afterthought, it’s built in. We keep your data safe, your systems stable, and your team confident, all while moving faster than the old-school DAPs. Learn more SOC 2 Type II compliant GDPR Compliant PCI-Compliant With Stripe CCPA Compliant Frequently Asked Questions How does Chameleon compare to traditional DAPs like Appcues or Pendo? Chameleon stands apart by focusing on native-feeling, non-disruptive in-app experiences that blend seamlessly into your product. While traditional DAPs like Appcues or Pendo often rely on pop-ups or overlays, Chameleon prioritizes embedded, context-aware elements—like banners and checklists—that enhance existing flows rather than interrupt them. It’s built for teams who value UX and want full control to personalize user journeys without compromising the product experience. Can Chameleon integrate with my existing tools? Yes! Chameleon is designed to fit seamlessly into your existing stack. It offers robust integrations with analytics platforms, CRMs, feature flag tools, data warehouses, and more—so you can trigger experiences based on real-time data, personalize content, and measure impact across your workflow. No need to rip and replace—just enhance what you already use. What kinds of in-app campaigns can I build with Chameleon? With Chameleon, you can create a range of customizable, native-feeling experiences—like onboarding checklists, embedded banners, product tours, microsurveys, and launch announcements. These are all built to guide users, drive adoption, and deliver value—without interrupting the product experience. Everything is fully controllable, so you can target specific segments, set precise triggers, and design flows that feel like a natural part of your app. You say you're customizable, but how granular can I get? Very granular. Chameleon gives you deep control over who sees what, when, and where. You can target experiences based on user attributes, behaviors, page URLs, custom events, or even specific CSS elements. You can also customize design down to the pixel, apply themes, and use advanced display rules—like rate limiting and element matching—to protect the user experience. It's built for teams that care about precision and polish. What kind of support does Chameleon offer? Chameleon offers hands-on, responsive support tailored to your needs. You’ll have access to a rich knowledge base, in-app guidance, and email support. For larger teams or complex use cases, Chameleon provides strategic onboarding, personalized training, and ongoing success check-ins to help you get the most out of the platform. Can you help me move off my previous tool? Absolutely. Chameleon offers migration support to help you transition smoothly from tools like Appcues, Pendo, or others. Our team can guide you through replicating key experiences, mapping data, and optimizing flows for better performance—so you don’t just copy-paste, you level up.
