🏆 CubeCraft League - 2nd Tournament 🏆
AnolTongi
Jul 18, 2025
Hello CubeCrafters, welcome back!

Today I'm glad to announce we will be starting the 2nd tournament of CubeCraft League! 

For those who don't know, CubeCraft League is an official tournament space for our community by our staff team. We host tournaments with prizes for the top 3, so gather your best team and play for the win!

Now, let's go over some things we need to know for this tournament.


 Games 

We will be playing BedWars 4v4 for our Java platform, and 5v5 Capture the Flag for our Bedrock platform.

For BedWars modifiers, Faster Generators will be the standard practice.

For Capture the Flag modifiers, Rush Mode will be the standard practice.

Some important notes for Capture the Flag:

Iron and diamond generators will not exist in Capture the Flag league matches.
If the match ends in a tie, the team with the most captured flags across all games will be the winner.
If the game is still tied, a 2v2 tiebreaker round will be played after the third game. Only 2 players from each team will participate in the tiebreaker round.



 Map Pool 

New tournament means new map pools! Let's take a small look, shall we?

 League Host Applications!

Our ex-moderators are more than welcome to apply to become a host for our league! The requirements are as following:

You must have been a staff member for at least 3 months.
You must not have any recent infractions.
You should be preferably active in the community, even a little bit.
If you meet these conditions, we would be more than happy to see you with us! You can apply to become a host by opening a discord ticket on our main discord server, or reach out to us directly!


The necessary details are in our Discord Server!
We are hoping to see you there soon, and good luck!​

Hello CubeCrafters!

Wow, it's July already... - You know what that means? It's Summertime! In this CubeCraft Monthly post, we'll show off what has dropped on CubeCraft this July! - Read below to learn more.




 Summer Event - Island Hunt, Maps & Bundles!

Our Summer 2025 is now live on Java & Bedrock. Featuring a brand new Island Hub, Hunt, Maps and Cosmetic Bundles!



Island Hub & Hunt!

We've resigned to our Summer lobby into a beautiful Island, with a Volcano, Candyland, Venice Town, Aztec Temple & More! - Once again, Cubit wants your help to find 30 hidden items around the Island. Find them all and you'll win a FREE Cage (Bedrock) or Hat (Java). We've also made three new parlours: Island Hillside, Venice & Island Village.


Spoiler: Island Parkours


Summer Hub 2025.


Island Hunt Rewards.​

Something special for our Java users. If you play CubeCraft and join our Summer event, you'll have the chance to obtain Summer Cubelets from playing games. Also, if you join the network once during the event, you'll get a free Summer Cubelet to open!
