They have a deep understanding of the industry and provide exceptional service and that is why I highly recommend them! « Amber Halverson, Sr. VP » Whatever success I have had with social media, print and broadcast media are still the best value for my advertising dollar. Running print and digital ads in The Spokesman-Review gets me a positive return every time. Whether it was for Spokane Poetry Slam, Harmony Yoga, or other businesses or non-profits I've worked with, the marketing team at the Spokesman understands their readers and knows how to place those ads where the people who see them are the ones who want what I'm promoting. « Isaac Grambo, former Commissioner of Spokane Poetry Slam, current Business Manager at Harmony Yoga » Spokesman Digital has been an important ingredient to our digital marketing.  Analyn and Hunter have been “top-notch”  in managing our account and our dynamic requirements.  Their team is knowledgeable, responsive, and accommodating to our unique advertising needs.  I give “Five Stars”  for  the Spokesman Digital team. « Tonya Yeager, Sales & Lending Coordinator » Print and digital ads from The Spokesman-Review really made a measurable difference in our business! We increased December sales 40 percent from the previous December when we didn't work with the Spokesman. The marketing staff makes it easy and the coverage provided by having ads in both print and digital puts our name in front of eyes we would never reach with social media or word-of-mouth alone. « Isaac Grambo, Business Manager, Harmony Yoga » I would like to express my gratitude on how well the ads in The Spokesman-Review worked for the Eastern Washington University hockey team in spreading the news not only for the Pac-8 league/tournament games this hockey season but for getting information out to the public about EWU having a hockey team/program. I can't count how many times I've been told "I didn't know EWU had a hockey team" when the topic came around about hockey in the area. The ads were very professional-looking, eye-catching in the sports page and I couldn't be any more pleased with how the ads came out. The ads did exactly what I wanted them to do, let people know about EWU having a hockey team and game schedule, worked perfectly and I would highly recommend placing an ad in the paper. « Gary Allen, EWU Club Hockey » Advertise with us now Follow Us Facebook Instagram TikTok X Newsletter Support Local Journalism Donate Visit the S-R Shop Buy Photo Reprints Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Care Sitemap Directory Subscription Services User Subscribe My Account Log in/Register Activate Log out Advertising Spokesman Digital Print & Digital Advertising Classifieds Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Company Jobs Newsroom Jobs at The Spokesman-Review Archives/Research RSS Feeds Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, WA 99201 Mailing Address P.O.
