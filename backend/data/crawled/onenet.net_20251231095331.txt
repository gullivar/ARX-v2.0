This includes transferring OU's large datasets to national repositories in service of NIH's data sharing requirement, and having researchers in EPSCoR jurisdictions transfer their large datasets to the NSF-funded OU & Regional Research Store (OURRstore) tape archive.” University of Central Oklahoma Dr. Bryan Duke, Dean of College of Education and Professional Studies “OneNet is ‘mission critical’ for our university. Moving to any other provider would be extremely disruptive and costly. OneNet is synonymous with the high-speed broadband internet service which we take for granted as we facilitate the development of individuals and deliver programs and services to meet the needs of the professional communities served by the college.” Oral Roberts University Michael L. Mathews, VP for Global Learning and Innovation "OneNet's ability to connect and sustain ORU's global network is the main reason ORU has 15 years of enrollment growth and students from 154 nations, making it the most diverse university in Oklahoma." Oklahoma City University Gerry Hunt, Chief Information Officer "OneNet has been an exceptional partner for Oklahoma City University, offering reliable IT services and steadfast support while effectively managing costs, allowing us to allocate resources where they are needed most." Mid-America Christian University Jody Allen, Chief Operating Officer & Chief Information Officer “MACU has partnered with OneNet for over 25 years. Their experience, knowledge, and genuine care to help universities have made them an invaluable partner. They continually grow to improve their technology offerings, and they provide value to us that benefits our students daily.” Redlands Community College Annie Pearson, Vice President for Academic Affairs “One of the most valuable aspects of OneNet's support for Redlands is its role as an offsite disaster recovery solution. In the event of a natural disaster, cyberattack or any other unforeseen crisis that could disrupt the college's on-campus network infrastructure, OneNet serves as a vital backup. This ensures that even in the face of adversity, Redlands can continue to operate, safeguarding essential data and resources.” Northwestern Oklahoma State University Dr. James Bell, Vice President for Academic Affairs “In 2018, NWOSU, along with two of its sister institutions, started a migration from its old student information system from the 1970s to a more modern appearing system. This new system required many more servers and resources. OneNet stepped in to provide these resources. OneNet now hosts, updates, and backs up over 25 virtual servers for NWOSU.” Subscriber & Network Support Customer Support Subscriber Support OneNet's helpdesk is available 24/7/365 for assistance with your OneNet services.
