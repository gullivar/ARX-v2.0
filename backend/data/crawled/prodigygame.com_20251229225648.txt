"Prodigy is a great way to get kids who don't like math into math."

Caralena Luthi

"In less than 12 months... I’ve got kids that have elevated two to three grade levels. That’s huge when you look at those kids who’ve grown three grade levels with everything that’s going on."

Stephen P.
5th Grade Teacher


"Having access to Prodigy really helps supplement our math learning and tells me what areas of the curriculum I need to add more focus on. I think all teachers should use Prodigy if possible because it is an amazing learning tool."
