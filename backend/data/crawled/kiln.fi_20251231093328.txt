Kiln is the leading enterprise-grade yield management platform, enabling institutional customers to generate yield on their digital assets or to whitelabel earning functionality into their products. Our platform is API-first and supports fully automated validators, rewards, data, and commission management. What is staking cryptocurrencies? Staking cryptocurrencies consists in locking native tokens (e.g ETH) in a Proof-of-Stake blockchain to earn the right to secure a chain and to be rewarded for doing so. Is staking cryptocurrencies safe? Staking cryptocurrencies is one of the safest and most predictable ways to get rewarded in the crypto space. At Kiln, we only support protocol staking, in which slashing is one of the risks you may need to worry about. Most of the PoS protocols depend on network participation and validator integrity so it is critical to select the right staking-as-a-service provider. If you'd like to learn more about how we implemented efficient anti-slashing strategies, please check our comprehensive guide on Ethereum anti-slashing strategies written with the help of the Ethereum foundation. Does Kiln offer solutions for implementing and automating other sources of yield beyond staking? Yes, Kiln offers a comprehensive yield management platform. In addition to Kiln Validators, Kiln DeFi enables integrators to access stablecoin yields through top DeFi lending and borrowing protocols. What are Kiln's security measures? As a provider of staking services, Kiln recognizes the importance of maintaining the highest levels of security and data protection, which is why we operate a 24/7 monitoring and maintenance system, and undergo multiple audits to safeguard our users' interests. Kiln is SOC2 Type 2 certified. How many blockchain protocols does Kiln support? Kiln's Staking-as-a-Service platform supports the most important blockchain protocols that include Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui, Aptos, Celestia, Polkadot etc. and the top lending and borrowing DeFi protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho etc. as well as our early protocols.

Copyright © Kiln 2025 Kiln is SOC 2 certified, as audited by Insight Assurance * Please note that rewards rates for staking are pre-determined and regulated by the rules of the relevant open-source blockchain protocol code. While the rewards rate is fixed, rewards are only guaranteed to validators that properly batch transactions into new blocks according to the protocol's rules and, in some cases, for verifying the work of other validators on the network. It is important to note that there are risks associated with staking, including the possibility of slashing penalties which may result in the loss of a portion of the staked assets. However, at Kiln, we offer slashing coverage to help mitigate the impact of this risk. It is important to thoroughly understand the risks and rewards associated with staking before participating in any staking activities. ×
