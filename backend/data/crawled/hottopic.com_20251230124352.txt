Hot Topic – The Ultimate Store for Pop Culture Merch and Shirts

Hot Topic is a 100% legit, officially licensed merchandise and clothing store. From band tees, pop culture-inspired collections and on-trend accessories, to in-demand collectibles and toys, anime merch and the hottest fashion apparel, we have what’s new and next. And it all comes in tons of styles and sizes, so everyone can fuel their fandom obsessions.

Pioneering Alt Fashion Since 1989

Founded in 1989, Hot Topic was the first retailer to bring alternative apparel and accessories to malls across the country. Originally known as the loudest store in the mall, now Hot Topic is a cultural icon and fandom haven for shoppers obsessed with music, movies, TV shows and all things pop culture. With over 630 store locations across the U.S. and Canada, and a website offering thousands of the hottest merch styles, Hot Topic is a source for community, discovery and inspiration, and continues to appeal to generations of fans.

Every Trend, Every Niche, Every Fandom

Why is Hot Topic the destination for music, entertainment and pop culture fanatics? We know pop culture because we are pop culture. Everything that happens in the cultural landscape is on our radar. New anime? We go Super Saiyan on that. The latest gamer gear? We’ve got you. Emo clothing? It’s not a phase–you’re covered for life. From Sanrio to slasher flicks to the bands you’ve loved for decades or just discovered, this enormous collection belongs to you.

100% Officially Licensed Merchandise

At Hot Topic, we’re the official partners of all your fave franchises and licenses. We said official for a reason– if you find it at Hot Topic, it’s legit and authentic. No matter what you consider your merch must-haves, we’ve got it. Shopping Disney? This is where the Disney diehard and devotees spend all their time. Star Wars? Harry Potter? Marvel? Fans, we’ve got you.

If you’re clawing for collectibles, if you’re after cool clothes, or if you’re chasing that can’t-describe-one-of-a-kind feeling that comes with your style of gotta-have merch, Hot Topic is THE spot to shop online or in a store near you. From graphic tees and goth apparel to Funko Pops! and Loungefly bags to band shirts and mini backpacks, everything in our collection (our very wide, varied, and curated collection, thank you very much) is here waiting for you.
