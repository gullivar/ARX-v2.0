How to End Mortgage Lock-In and Get Americans Moving Again

Many Americans are stuck in place. Since 2022, annual sales of existing homes in the U.S. have fallen to about 4.1 million. The market is depressed despite robust economic growth. Why?

The Right Diagnosis, the Wrong Prescription: Why a “Golden Fleet” Misses the Mark

Rebranding maritime power with gold-plated symbolism and reviving capital ships designed for a different era risks confusing seriousness with spectacle and spending political capital on platforms that won’t survive the fight we’re actually preparing for.

The Culture War Comes for Science

With the Trump administration's attacks on federal science, the old social contract for science may not survive. Rather than try to recreate an imperfect past, we must begin drafting a new social contract for science.

Rethinking Accreditation in Higher Education

Accreditors rarely revoke approval because of academic failure. Instead, loss of status typically follows financial collapse, not poor learning outcomes. At the state level, weak or politicized oversight can be worse: Licensing and specialty boards often go years without campus visits, with leadership changing annually and boards making appointments for political convenience. Even reform-minded advocates admit that if oversight shifted to states, strong guardrails would be essential to prevent local patronage from replacing federal inertia.

How Congress Lost, Part IX: Resilient Corruption and an Emerging Progressive Critique in the Late 19th Century

Though the 1883 Pendleton Civil Service Act drastically reduced federal patronage, political machines proved extremely durable. A new breed of party boss built strong party organizations by forging a tight connection with business interests. In the face of persistent corruption, reformers like Woodrow Wilson theorized on how to reform the government, focusing on drastically reducing Congress’s role in American political life.

The Marketplace of Ideas in the Higher Education Compact

The Trump administration’s proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education was right to critique the problems with free inquiry and discourse on campus, but its proposed solutions are vague, unworkable, and problematic.

Foreign Entanglements in the Higher Education Compact

The Trump administration’s proposals to cap foreign student enrollment at 15 percent of undergraduates and improve transparency regarding foreign gifts, grants, and contracts are useful steps to redirect universities toward American interests, but they do not go nearly far enough.

Student Equality in the Higher Education Compact

The Trump administration’s Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education insists that college faculty and administrators must always treat students “as individuals and not on the basis of their immutable characteristics.” It also requires schools to assign students to sex-segregated facilities on the basis of biological sex rather than gender identity.

Trump’s ‘Peace Plan’ for Ukraine Is Wicked

It is necessary to deal with criminals. It is immoral – and, if history teaches, dangerous – to absolve them of crimes and reward them. Yet this is how Trump’s peace plan treats Putin’s Russia. In the…

Why Trump Will Never Be Able to End the War in Ukraine

I’m always amused by people—many in our own government and media—who are astonished by Vladimir Putin’s refusal to accept any Russia-Ukraine agreement that is put before him. Stolidly, he says that he will accept nothing short of a Ukraine capitulation.
