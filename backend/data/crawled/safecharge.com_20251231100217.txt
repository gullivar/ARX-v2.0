MiCAR authorization enables Nuvei to deliver regulated crypto-asset services and passport them across the European Union MONTREAL. Dec. 17, 2025 — Nuvei today announced that it has received a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) license under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), positioning the company to operate under the EU’s new, harmonized regulatory framework for crypto assets. The MiCAR license enables Nuvei to provide regulated crypto-asset services across the European Union and passport those services across EU member states under a single regulatory regime. This significantly simplifies expansion for merchants and platforms seeking to deploy crypto-enabled payment and settlement capabilities across multiple European markets. Under the license, Nuvei can offer regulated crypto-asset services including cryptocurrency storage and administration, transfers, and the exchange of crypto-assets into funds, integrated into its broader global payments infrastructure. “This authorization marks an important milestone in the convergence of payments and digital assets,” said Phil Fayer, Chair and CEO of Nuvei. “MiCAR brings long-needed regulatory clarity to Europe. Operating under this framework allows us to help customers move value across crypto and traditional payment rails with confidence, consistency, and scale.” In addition to the MiCAR authorization, Nuvei has also obtained a Payment Institution license, enabling services related to electronic money tokens (EMTs). Together, these authorizations allow Nuvei to support crypto-asset, EMT, and fiat-based payment and settlement flows through a unified, regulated platform. For customers, the combined capabilities mean: •	Simplified access to crypto payments across Europe •	Compliant fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat flows •	Faster, more transparent settlement options •	Reduced regulatory and operational complexity when scaling across EU markets ‍ With these licenses, Nuvei will serve both business clients and retail consumers.

The move significantly expands Nuvei’s global processing capabilities beyond enabling 10,000 transactions per second, with a target 99.999 percent availability for enterprise merchants. It also strengthens Nuvei’s position among the highest-volume processors worldwide and establishes a resilient, AI-powered foundation to support more than $1 trillion in annual payment volume as businesses scale internationally. This milestone reflects a significant investment and multi-year focus to migrate all Nuvei platforms to the cloud to help clients scale globally with higher performance and greater efficiency. By migrating core services to Azure, Nuvei gains enhanced elasticity, faster performance, and more consistent global reliability, while refreshing key components and reducing reliance on third-party technologies. This modernized architecture also creates a larger runway for ongoing innovation, enabling Nuvei to accelerate future enhancements and deliver even higher levels of resilience and optimization over time. “Every payment should succeed with speed and accuracy, every time, wherever our customers operate,” said Phil Fayer, Chair and CEO, Nuvei . “Running our core processing on Microsoft Azure gives us an AI-native foundation that adapts in real time, optimizes transactions globally, and meets regional data-residency requirements. It strengthens performance today and enables us to deliver new AI-driven capabilities as our clients scale.” Processing payments on Azure enables a distributed architecture that absorbs peak transaction volume, maintains continuous uptime, and optimizes latency and authorization outcomes worldwide. This ensures maximum revenue capture and uninterrupted consumer experiences even during the most demanding global commerce events. “Microsoft Azure’s AI-ready infrastructure complements Nuvei’s enterprise payments expertise,” said Tyler Pichach, Global Head of Payments Strategy, Microsoft . “This step positions Nuvei to deliver the resilient, responsive, and optimized payment experiences required for the future of global commerce.” As part of this broader modernization, Nuvei’s core APIs and services now leverage Azure’s capabilities to deliver a secure, scalable, and globally distributed payment infrastructure. Core services include Azure ExpressRoute for private connectivity, Azure Firewall for network protection, and Azure Kubernetes Service for containerized workloads. To strengthen security and compliance, the solution integrates Azure Defender for Cloud for advanced threat protection and Azure Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) for robust application-level security. The architecture spans four strategic regions – UK South, Sweden Central, US West, and US East – ensuring high availability, resilience, and consistent performance for businesses worldwide. Nuvei will continue rolling out infrastructure enhancements that improve global performance, onboarding efficiency, and Azure AI-driven transaction optimization.

Wero is designed to deliver instant, secure account-to-account payments across Europe. Earlier this year, Nuvei were among the very first payment processors to complete a Wero transaction in a testing environment, and is now one of the first processors to begin processing merchant transactions. Wero enables instant account-to-account (A2A) payments through SEPA Instant Credit Transfer protocols, allowing consumers to pay securely and directly from their bank accounts in seconds. For merchants, adding Wero expands consumer choice at checkout, reduces payment processing costs, and accelerates settlement, enhancing both conversion and cash flow. According to Statista, nearly 60% of European consumers say they are more likely to complete an online purchase when offered their preferred local payment method . [1] The Baymard Institute identifies lack of preferred payment options as one of the top causes of cart abandonment, cited by over 9% of shoppers. [2] Deloitte research further shows that merchants offering a broader mix of payment methods can see conversion rate improvements of up to 20% and stronger customer loyalty. [3] With over 46 million users in Europe [4] , adoption of Wero as a preferred payment method in the region is already sizeable. Over 100 million P2P transactions, valued at more than five billion euros, have already been completed via the digital wallet. [5] Phil Fayer, Nuvei Chair and CEO , said: “Going live with Wero is another example of how Nuvei enables merchants to offer the most advanced and locally relevant payment methods through a single integration. Today’s consumers expect flexibility, speed, and security at checkout, and Wero delivers on all three. We’re proud to help European merchants like CamperDays capture more sales and build trust with their customers.” ‍ Martina Weimert, CEO of EPI , added: “Seeing Wero live in eCommerce checkouts through Nuvei is an exciting milestone for European payments. Wero simplifies the payment experience for consumers while providing merchants with a cost-efficient alternative to traditional cards. Nuvei will bring an important contribution in driving the adoption of a truly European payment solution that strengthens the continent’s financial sovereignty. We are looking forward this cooperation.” CamperDays, a leading online campervan rental platform, is among the first merchants now accepting Wero in its online checkout via Nuvei. ‍ Max Schmidt, Managing Director of CamperDays , said: “At CamperDays, we’re committed to making travel booking as simple and secure as possible. Adding Wero as a payment option through Nuvei gives our customers a fast, trusted way to pay directly from their bank accounts. Offering more choice at checkout helps us meet diverse preferences and deliver the best possible booking experience.” This launch expands Nuvei’s continued expansion of its alternative payment method (APM) portfolio, empowering merchants to offer localized, consumer-preferred experiences through a single integration. About EPI EPI (or European Payments Initiative) is supported by 16 European banks and payment service providers.They have joined forces with a common goal: to offer a unified mobile payment service, to all European companies and citizens. EPI intends to enable European consumers and merchants and to carry out all types of retail transactions simply, via a resolutely sovereign digital wallet. Find out more at epicompany.eu About Wero Based on instant account-to-account (A2A) payments, Wero further streamlines payments in Europe by eliminating intermediaries in the payment chain and the associated additional costs. Wero already supports payments between individuals, and will shortly unveil payments to professionals (P2Pro) and those for online and mobile purchases.

Nuvei is among the first global acquirers to enable Visa Direct for Account alongside Visa Direct for Card ,strengthening its position as a Visa partner in enabling faster global money movement. This milestone builds on prior collaborations between the two companies, including being an early acquirer to offer Visa Direct for Card in countries such as Colombia and supporting Visa’s Agentic Commerce initiatives . Built on Visa’s trusted payment network , Visa Direct for Account complements Nuvei’s existing Visa Direct for Card capability to deliver a range of payout options. With a single integration, merchants can offer account-based payouts in multiple currencies and, for eligible card transactions, faster funds availability that can improve cash flow, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. “Consumers everywhere expect instant access to their money, whether it is a payout, refund, or remittance,”said Phil Fayer, Chair and CEO of Nuvei . “By expanding our Visa Direct offering, we’re empowering merchants to meet those expectations with faster, more convenient, and more reliable payouts that enhance everyday financial experiences.” “Meaningful progress in payouts comes from ecosystem collaboration,” said Vira Platanova, Global Head of Visa Direct .“Expanding our integration with Nuvei’s platform means we are able to help more businesses reach payees with capabilities built for scale, compliance, and operational simplicity.” For merchants, Visa Direct for Account delivers significant operational and financial advantages . By tapping into Nuvei and Visa’s combined global infrastructure and reach, it enables businesses to serve more consumers in more countries through fast, account-based payouts. The solution also helps reduce transfer fees and foreign exchange costs compared to traditional methods, while simplifying treasury workflows through a single, integrated payout platform. Visa Direct for Account supports a broad range of use cases, including gig economy earnings, insurance claims, remittances, marketplace settlements, loan disbursements, and digital goods payouts . Through Nuvei’s platform, businesses can reach more countries and deliver payouts in local currencies through a single, secure connection.

Global account-based payouts and real-time payment adoption continues to grow rapidly,with consumer A2A transaction value projected to rise from USD 1.7 trillion in 2024 to USD 5.7 trillion by 2029 [2], an increase of approximately 230 percent. As real-time and instant payments continue to mature, they are expected to account for a growing share of non-cash transaction volumes, with Capgemini estimating that instant payments will represent 22 percent of all non-cash transactions by 2028 .[3] The first phase of the rollout begins in Europe, with more geographies and capabilities planned for 2026.

Trusted Agent Protocol, introduced today by Visa, is part of Visa Intelligent Commerce (VIC) , a global framework designed to help merchants securely engage with AI-powered agents acting on behalf of consumers. Built on open standards, including HTTP Message Signatures (RFC 9421), the protocol enables merchants to distinguish legitimate agent activity from malicious automation, requiring minimal changes to existing checkout flows. Driving the Future of Acquiring Through its collaboration with Visa, Nuvei is contributing to the inaugural Agent Enabler pilot and helping ensure acquirers can support trusted agent-driven transactions securely and at scale. This work represents a step forward in evolving the role of acquirers to meet the demands of intelligent commerce, where digital agents increasingly search, compare, and pay on behalf of consumers.

By dramatically simplifying technical integration, the launch advances Nuvei’s strategy to embed AI across the payments lifecycle, helping businesses go live faster, reduce costly errors , and access optimization tools that accelerate revenue growth. For enterprise merchants, even small improvements in payment performance can unlock millions in incremental revenue. Faster onboarding means merchants can start processing transactions, optimizing approval rates, and reducing costs much sooner, giving them a competitive edge in today’s rapidly evolving commerce landscape. The launch reflects Nuvei’s embrace of “agentic commerce”, where autonomous AI agents are beginning to transform how complex payment workflows are connected and optimized. The Integration Agent marks the beginning of Nuvei’s roadmap in this space, furthering its broader AI strategy to embed intelligence across the entire payments lifecycle. With additional agents planned to extend optimization across fraud detection, revenue intelligence, and transaction performance, alongside additional AI-driven enhancements across Nuvei’s technology stack and operations, the company is simplifying and accelerating enterprise payments at scale. The Integration Agent is available today in early access for select merchant partners, with broader rollout planned later this year. Additional agents are expected to launch in 2026. Phil Fayer, Chair and CEO of Nuvei , said: “AI is transforming payments by removing complexity and accelerating growth for businesses. This launch extends Nuvei’s AI strategy to embed intelligence across every layer of our platform, delivering greater speed, accuracy, and scale. The Integration Agent is one of several initiatives at Nuvei as we move towards full agentic commerce that are enabling enterprises to connect, optimize, and innovate across the payments lifecycle in new ways.” Streamlining Complex Payment Integrations Built on the open Model Context Protocol (MCP) , the Nuvei Integration Agent streamlines one of the most time-consuming challenges in payments today: technical integration. By translating Nuvei’s technical documentation into a standardized format that large language models (LLMs) can interpret directly, the Integration Agent reduces friction and manual effort throughout the integration process. Early adopters report: Integration timelines reduced from weeks to hours ‍ Up to 40% fewer errors during setup Complex issues resolved in less than 30 minutes ‍ Non-technical users able to generate working integration code Advancing Nuvei’s AI Strategy This launch is part of Nuvei’s broader AI strategy to embed intelligence across its platform and operations to drive growth and efficiency.
