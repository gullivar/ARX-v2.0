What is PeerTube? https://joinpeertube.org/faq#what-is-peertube PeerTube is a tool that you install on a web server. It allows you to create a video hosting website, so create your "homemade YouTube". The difference to YouTube is that it's not intended to create a huge platform centralizing videos from the whole world on a single server farm (which is horribly expensive). On the contrary, PeerTube's concept is to create a network of multiple small interconnected video hosting providers. Is PeerTube's purpose to replace YouTube? https://joinpeertube.org/faq#is-peertube-s-purpose-to-replace-youtube We can answer with certainty: no! The ambition remains to be a free and decentralized alternative : the goal of an alternative is not to replace, but to propose something else, with different values, in parallel to what already exists.
