Most strategy and deal teams still use reactive intelligence — and it costs them
Predictive intelligence gives strategy and deal teams what they’ve always wanted: a head start
The system strategy and deal teams use to move first

CB Insights continuously monitors millions of private companies, markets, and competitive signals — using AI to surface early insight that informs the deals, partnerships, and moves you make next.

Shape direction before the market forces your hand

Predictive Intelligence reveals early market and competitive shifts, giving you time to choose the move — instead of inheriting one.

See competitors’ moves while they’re still forming

Early signals reveal how competitors are shifting focus, forming partnerships, and placing strategic bets, so you can respond deliberately — or neutralize moves before they take hold.

Win the M&A, investment, and partnership opportunities that define your growth

Early clarity on direction, targets, and timing lets you act with conviction — securing the opportunities that fit your goals before the market crowds in.

Win more. Win bigger.

This is the impact of seeing the right next move early.

Our customers out-execute competitors:

more acquisitions

6x

more investments

4.5x

more partnerships

Those moves compound into growth:

more new pipeline

70%

faster revenue growth than peers

“Real-time visibility into every emerging tech market.”

“In a matter of minutes, we created a target list and screened 6 M&A targets for a big meeting. Our client acquired one of them 3 months later.”

BIG 4 GLOBAL CONSULTANT

“I can find and validate the best clients, 10x faster than before.”

MAJOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COMPANY

“A market leader in helping companies find investment.”

TOP TEN GLOBAL VC

“What’s happening, why it matters, and what you need to do next.”

“Helps us to compress our time to decision.”

“CB Insights surfaced a company that was disrupting its market, and — a key detail — that it was backed by two very wealthy local investors. This led directly to a $100m+ deal.”

MAJOR GLOBAL TELCO

“We review twice as many companies now with the confidence that we have a full view of the market.”

“We’ve taken the guesswork out of innovation.”

“With their proprietary business relationship data, we uncovered and won a $100M deal that would have been invisible without CB Insights.”

BIG 3 CLOUD LEADER
