By pairing discounted locked-token purchases with delta-neutral hedging, the protocol offers yields that are less dependent on funding rate cycles than traditional cash and carry strategies. Early traction has been strong, with TVL growing from $120M to $210M following the removal of deposit caps, while sNUSD currently yields materially more than competing yield-bearing stablecoins. The key question for Neutrl is scalability: whether access to high-quality OTC deal flow and disciplined liquidity management can support continued TVL growth without compressing returns. by Kunal Doshi / December 31, 2025 Blockworks Research BWR 2026 Theses As the year comes to an end, it’s a good time to reflect on the progress made in 2025 and how we’re positioned heading into 2026. This report outlines our key theses across each analyst's focus area, spanning capital formation, onchain spot trading platforms, prediction markets, DePIN, credit markets, perpetuals, and more. by Carlos Gonzalez Campo / December 26, 2025 Blockworks Research Galaxy: The Ultimate Crypto x AI Play Galaxy sits at the intersection of two defining cycles in crypto and AI. Digital Assets is Galaxy’s institutional crypto franchise, spanning trading, lending, and asset management and infrastructure solutions. Helios is the company’s contracted AI HPC data center buildout, positioning Galaxy for a multi year ramp in longer duration infrastructure cash flows. Treasury and Corporate is a volatile sleeve of crypto and venture exposures that can amplify earnings swings and complicate valuation. We view this mix as both the opportunity and the challenge. It creates a rare one ticker barbell on crypto activity and contracted AI infrastructure cash flows, but it also adds complexity that can obscure earnings and delay a clean sum of the parts rerating. by Sam Schubert / December 22, 2025 Blockworks Research ZKsync and Grvt: Enabling Composable Perpetuals Perp DEX design has been a sequence of compromises: AMM perps preserved Ethereum composability but concentrated LP risk, hybrids regained CEX-like latency with onchain settlement, and specialized chains delivered fully onchain CLOB performance while isolating liquidity away from Ethereum’s $122B DeFi collateral. ZKsync Atlas is the next step, enabling sub-second proof finality and cross-domain margin so venues like Grvt and Lighter can access L1-native collateral without bridging, shifting the competitive axis from pure speed to unified liquidity. by Shaunda Devens / December 18, 2025 newsletter The Breakdown Decoding crypto and the markets.
