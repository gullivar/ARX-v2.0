WHY TAILWIND CSS?

Built for the modern web.
text-base 
text-gray-950

Tailwind is unapologetically modern, and takes advantage of all the latest and greatest CSS features to make the developer experience as enjoyable as possible.

Responsive design

Okay, it’s not exactly cutting edge, but just throw a screen size in front of literally any utility to apply it at a specific breakpoint.

Filters

What’s a website these days without a few backdrop blurs? Keep stacking filters until your designer asks you to please, please stop.

blur-sm
brightness-150
grayscale
contrast-150
saturate-200
sepia
Dark mode

If you’re not a fan of burning your retinas, just stick dark: in front of any color to apply it in dark mode.

CSS variables

Customizing your theme is as simple as creating a few CSS variables.

@theme {
  --font-sans: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --font-mono: "IBM Plex Mono", monospace;
  --text-tiny: 0.625rem;
  --text-tiny--line-height: 1.5rem;
  --color-mint-100: oklch(0.97 0.15 145);
  --color-mint-200: oklch(0.92 0.18 145);
  --color-mint-300: oklch(0.85 0.22 145);
  --color-mint-400: oklch(0.78 0.25 145);
  --color-mint-500: oklch(0.7 0.28 145);
  --color-mint-600: oklch(0.63 0.3 145);
  --color-mint-700: oklch(0.56 0.32 145);
  --color-mint-800: oklch(0.48 0.35 145);
  --color-mint-900: oklch(0.4 0.37 145);

CSS grid layout

Using grid utilities directly in your HTML makes it so much easier to reason about complex layouts.

Transitions and animations

Transitions that work the way you'd expect — throw a few utilities on an element and you're in business.

Cascade layers

Tailwind uses CSS layers so you don’t have to worry about specificity issues.

@layer theme, base, components, utilities;
@layer theme {
  :root {
    /* Your theme variables */
  }
}
@layer base {
  /* Preflight styles */
}
@layer components {
  /* Your custom components */
}
@layer utilities {
  /* Your utility classes */
}
Logical properties

Supporting multiple language text directions is no longer a nightmare.

Container queries

Tag an element as a container to let children adapt to changes in its size.

<div class="@container">
  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 @sm:grid-cols-2">
    <img
      src="/img/photo-1.jpg"
      class="aspect-square @sm:aspect-3/2 object-cover"
    />
    <img
      src="/img/photo-2.jpg"
      class="aspect-square @sm:aspect-3/2 object-cover"
    />
    <img
      src="/img/photo-3.jpg"
      class="aspect-square @sm:aspect-3/2 object-cover"
    />
    <img
      src="/img/photo-4.jpg"
      class="aspect-square @sm:aspect-3/2 object-cover"
    />
  </div>
</div>
Gradients

No need to remember that complicated gradient syntax — create silky-smooth gradients with just a few utility classes.

Power Meets Precision
Redefining real-time performance

Our next-generation rendering engine delivers unmatched speed and efficiency, empowering creators to push boundaries like never before.

Render time performance

3D transforms

Sometimes two dimensions aren’t enough. Scale, rotate, and translate any element in 3D space to add a touch of depth.

HOW IT WORKS

Ship faster and smaller.
text-base 
text-gray-950

Tailwind automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production, which means your final CSS bundle is the smallest it could possibly be. In fact, most Tailwind projects ship less than 10kB of CSS to the client.

<!DOCTYPE html>

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/build.css" />
