FEEDBACKBIRD.IO We just love the free WP Statistics WordPress plugin by VeronaLabs at MyMansion. It gives us advanced statistics about visitors to our website giving us valuable information. Plus, it’s so much simpler to use than the Google search console and sits right within our WordPress Dashboard. It’s GDPR compliant and instantly shows us our most popular pages. The data can even be exported. Did I say it was free? Thanks, VeronaLabs. Steve Baron MYMANSION, CEO WP Statistics is an amazing plugin. Aside from being a free plugin, this one is easy to use and understand. The most amazing part is that it has a lot of features that either can be found in premium plugins or in many different free plugins with similar functionality but you need to install separately. Now with just one plugin, I can now have all the data that I need at my WordPress dashboard. Ruby Caberte Blogger Pinay Mommy Online Excellent job and communication by VeronaLabs team.
