Faster and more accurate typing than ever before

Tired of repetitive typing? Store and share a library of your collective
knowledge and activate it anywhere you type with only a few keystrokes.

Here’s how it works:

Create Snippets of your most used text, such as emails, phrases, URLs, and more.

Customize them to automatically insert content or add fill-in-the-blank fields.

Expand them with just a few keystrokes on any device, across any app you use.

Share them with your team so everyone stays consistent with up-to-date content.

FOR ENTERPRISE

Case Study

See how each member of Virta Health’s Care Team saved 24 days per year with TextExpander
Read the case study

Now we have a system for creating and updating the messaging our coaches use as a framework to communicate with our members, with personalization top of mind.

Kristin Hullett, Care Operations Senior Associate at Virta Health

It genuinely streamlines my work day so much. I love that my own Snippets are separate from my orgs and how when I go to edit a snippet I just used, it is glowing and easy to locate visually. Also, love that you can include emojis.

Kenzie P.

With the volume of emails and live chats that I manage daily, I literally could not get through my workday without Text Expander. It’s a LIFESAVER.

Marysa K.

Support

TextExpander has made working a breeze. They really changed the way we think about internal notes.

Brianna W.

Support

TextExpander has improved my productivity ten-fold, it is easy to use, and full of capability. I use it in almost all tasks now! It saves so much time instead of having to type the same things out over and over!

Justin F.

Fraud Investigator

I send many emails with the same wording to recruiting candidates over and over again. TextExpander helps so that all of my wording is uniform for each candidate to streamline information. It also reduces the time it takes me to send out emails to every person significantly.

Haley M.

Recruiting Business Partner

Text expander makes my job so much easier! I don’t have to type out as much and it’s so easy to create customized snippets that are tailored to your preference. In the medical field it’s especially helpful so we can spend more time with patients and less time charting.

Angelina E.

Customer Onboarding Manager

I am able to keep and store items that I tell customers over and over again but without typing it out each time! I love that I can edit them to add more information and improve my customer communication.

Sandra M.

Implementation Specialist

What I love about TextExpander is that it saves me so much time with repetitive details of my job. It’s wonderful how a snippet will save me time and the trouble of writing everything out completely. I also love that I am able to share my snippets in my work environment and vice versa.

Adriana H.

Medical Scribe

Like using dot phrases but just typing shortcuts.

Mike Y.

Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine

No more monotonous writing in chats and emails. Very user friendly as you can figure out things by yourself. I do not need to spend time writing the same thing again and again as I have to answer to similar questions everyday. I can use it even in intercom and other websites for usual templates.

Nazifa Z.

Patient Care Advocate

As a health care provider, documentation is my least favorite thing. In my current EMR there are no macros. I saved an average of 6 to 10 hours/week using TextExpander. Set up was easy. And it is incredibly affordable. I use it daily.

Pediatric Nurse Practitioner

Extremely easy to set up & train team on, and then once the team was trained we are able to use it every day! We can use it in Salesforce, Microsoft Office, or literally any other text box. It allows us to standardize language and save time. Customer Support has been great as well in helping us troubleshoot problems.

A. Thomas

Client Service Coordinator

I like that textexpander is easy to use and the interface is very user-friendly. It was easy to implement in my daily tasks and helped me to be more efficient. I use the app every single day because it helps me to get through my days with ease.

Jessica J.

Provider Retention

This tool solves the rate at which I find specific information and helps me retain product knowledge and more confidently do my job. I talk on the phone and write emails daily, so text expanders help convey product knowledge daily.

Nadia P.

Sales

Formatting is so seamless, always populates correctly. I love the keyboard shortcut to find a snippet, helps me work quickly. I don’t work without TE, and I use it for everything from templates for emails and notes to customer replies and code.

Jen W.

Support

Moreso than the time savings, TextExpander saves me from grief and robotic repetitiveness. My workflow has significantly improved by being able to quickly insert often-used phrases, questions, or sign-offs.

Mark M.

Product Support

TextExpander is a tool that I cannot live without. I regularly use it to perform repetitive tasks that previously required copying, pasting, and editing. The ability to fill in single-line fields has transformed error-prone tasks into simple and reliable text snippets that I use daily in emails, static website updates, and terminal commands.

Stewart L.

Software Developer

The app you didn’t know you needed until you can’t live without it! I’ve used it for years now and always adding new templates which save me so much time. Whenever I show it to someone else they all gasp and ask how they can get it. It’s like magic!
