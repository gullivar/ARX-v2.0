View More Frequently Asked Questions Answers to commonly asked questions about Replo Contact Us What key insights should I know to maximize page performance? Thousands of brands have built their stores on Replo. Here are a few key trends we’ve consistently seen across the top 10 highest-performing Replo pages (selected from all pages with 5K+ sessions and 2%+ CVR over a 30 day period): Product-forward pages always generate the highest conversion rates. Your hero section does not have to be product-forward, but it should always highlight your value prop. Highlight and repeat any and all social proof you have across your pages. This includes reviews, badges, certificates, and UGC in video format. Make sure to give as much information on the product ingredients or composition, without overwhelming the shopper. Balance informative product boxes with clean, easy-to-read layouts, such as accordions. Insert related or recommended product carousels, such as “You might also like...” sections to boost average order value. The above tactics are a great place to get started for improving landing page conversion rates and bounce rates.

How does Replo affect page speed? Replo V2 runs natively on Cloudflare, delivering enterprise-grade speed, reliability, and scalability from over 300+ cities around the world. On average, Replo’s pages will load in under 50–100 ms time to first byte (TTFB) globally. This means that every page is rendered and served directly from the edge. Visitors experience near-instant load times—reducing bounce rates and lifting conversion rates at each stage of the customer journey. For more information on page speed best practices and how Replo improves your page speed, visit our blog guide or our complete support guide to get started. Replo Sites pages publish to subdomains. How does that help my store? Driving ad traffic to a subdomain instead of the main store domain gives brands the freedom to test, track, and market their products without risking their core site’s performance. Here’s how: Subdomains act like controlled “sandboxes,” letting marketers A/B test new landing pages designs and flows otherwise not possible with traditional ecommerce platforms such as Shopify. These pages would not touch the main store, de-risking the experimentation process and allowing creative flexibility with different funnel structures. Subdomains also enable faster deployment, cleaner attribution, and pixel isolation (ex: you can assign unique Meta and Google pixels to the subdomain for campaign-specific tracking). This makes it easier to measure cold-traffic behavior accurately. Because subdomains are treated as separate entities, they also prevent failed tests from skewing site-wide analytics. Subdomains are valuable for SAFT (sex, alcohol, firearms, tobacco, CBD/THC, pharmaceuticals) brands advertising on Meta. Meta’s ad policies restrict direct promotion of certain product categories, but subdomains can host compliant, educational, or age-gated content that links indirectly to the main store. This setup keeps ads policy-compliant while still driving interest and traffic. I want to get started on or get better at A/B Testing. Where do I start and what do I do? We’re so glad you asked! Replo comes with our own built-in A/B testing tool, so you can start experimenting and iterating, without leaving the app. If you’re new to A/B testing, start simple: test one change at a time and focus on metrics that tie directly to revenue, not just clicks. A/B testing is all about proving what actually moves the needle, so you’ll compare two versions of a page or element—like a headline, product image, or call-to-action button—and split your audience evenly between them. Let your test run through at least two full business cycles (or at least 2 full business weeks) so you catch natural traffic patterns and avoid false positives. Define your hypothesis clearly (“if we make X change, Y will happen”) and use a statistical significance calculator to know how long to run a test for. Don’t rush results; ending early or testing too many variables at once will muddy the data and waste valuable insights. If you’re already running tests and want to level up, start thinking bigger: go beyond single-element tweaks and move into multivariate, funnel, or personalization testing. Test entire page experiences, like product page versus listicle-style landers, to measure funnel results instead of isolated clicks. Segment by device or traffic source to uncover hidden wins—what converts on desktop might flop on mobile. Always tie your tests to a specific revenue goal (conversion rate, AOV, or revenue per session) so your insights stay grounded in profit, not vanity metrics. Finally, build a testing rhythm: document every experiment, promote proven winners as your new control, and keep iterating. Learn more about A/B testing and how to get started. How can I use Replo for product launches? Replo makes launching new products and services for your business simple with templates in our Inspo Library. Options include pre-orders, product drops, waitlists, “Coming Soon” pages, and more. For custom designs built fast, you can use chat to add urgency elements like countdown timers, product announcement banners, or even waitlist forms that connect to any of our direct marketing integrations . You can also promote upcoming launches across your pages with pop-ups, which can be added by inserting code snippets. Learn how you can use Replo for every page type or industry use case in our docs. I design in Figma. How does that work in Replo? Replo supports importing existing designs from Figma using any Figma to Code extension. We recommend this one called: “ Figma to Code ”. You can do this by selecting any frame in Figma, choosing React (JSX), and copying and pasting the code into Replo chat. Replo instantly converts it into editable sections in our chat. Alternatively, you can also ask ChatGPT to write the code; any code language will work, though React (JSX) or HTML is preferred. When trying to apply a highly specific design, supplying any code will make the chat perform better than without. Most teams can move a section from Figma to Replo in 20–40 seconds, or a full page in under 15 minutes, giving designers and marketers a fast path from mockup to publishable page. Finally, you can always export your Figma frames as PNGs and copy them into the Replo chat as images. Using images to prompt Replo chat helps it make more precise 1-to-1 edits or page/section generations. How does Replo help with influencer/creator campaigns and increasing creator conversion rate? With Replo, you can create targeted pages for any influencer use case, including but not limited to: brand ambassador giveaways, limited-edition product drops, online courses, affiliate programs, and even sweepstakes. We make it easy to turn influencer traffic into sales by allowing users to build custom landing pages for each creator in minutes—matching their personal brand, visuals, and target audience. Simply drop in assets or screenshots from the influencer’s platforms into the Replo Sites chat, and Replo will design landing pages personalized to each influencer unique online presence. Prompt the chat with sections of influencer content as reference, and Replo will match the tone and voice of the landing page to their brand. Examples of tailored influencer landing pages created by some of our top customers include Hexclad’s Gordon Ramsey page featuring co-branded cookware collections, as well Cozyearth’s co-branded influencer podcast landing pages. On top of that, Replo automatically integrates with analytics tools you already love like GA4, Triplewhale, and Meta, so you can track conversion rate by creator and optimize these sales funnels on a creator-to-creator level. Learn how to set up integrations in our docs . Why you should match each ad offer to a unique landing page? Every ad speaks to a different audience and value prop—sending all ad traffic to one page kills that relevance. Matching each offer or positioning to a unique landing page keeps the message, visuals, and call to action aligned, which lowers bounce rates compared in comparison to generic landing pages. In addition, studies have shown that content continuity and congruence between all stages of a marketing funnel can increase conversion rates by 50-60%. Replo helps you create tailored ad to landing page funnels and test them faster than ever. A great example of unique value prop-focused pages include this LP by Dog Is Human that targets older pets with joint problems , versus another LP by the same brand that targets pets with skin and coat issues . Could I build my whole website with Replo? Yes—Replo can power your entire website, not just individual sales campaigns. You can build multiple pages like your homepage, blog, and product pages, and link them together directly inside the Replo Sites chat for seamless navigation. One of our most successful customers, Jot.co , built their entire site on Replo and now drives millions in revenue through it. Whether you’re a single-SKU small business or a high-growth enterprise building multiple microsites, Replo gives you full control to design, connect, and scale every page of your site. Does Replo help with custom integrations (e.g. Find in Store, Waitlists, etc)? Absolutely. If you’d like to integrate an app that we do not have a direct integration for, you can connect to virtually any callable REST or GraphQL API by prompting the Replo chat. Custom integrations work across all pages so any component can access live data from your systems. Or, you can paste code snippets directly into Replo to integrate with your backend—letting you build dynamic experiences that pull live data from your systems without leaving the app. This includes connecting to an inventory API for real-time “Find in Store” data, hooking into order management for limited product drops, or tying into a loyalty backend to show points or personalized pricing. Visit our docs for more information on how integrations work in Replo . If you need additional help for a custom integration, please contact us at support@replo.app . What are landing pages? What are landing pages for? Landing pages are the digital equivalent of a first impression—standalone web pages built with one clear goal. Unlike a full website juggling multiple objectives, a landing page guides visitors toward a single action known as conversions, like buying a product, signing up for a waitlist, or joining a giveaway. Because of that focus, they’re flexible: great for custom influencer product pages, exclusive membership sign-up pages, brand ambassador product giveaways, A/B tests at each stage of the marketing funnel, or limited-edition seasonal drops. Brands can even build entire sites from a collection of landing pages, each one focused on a specific audience or goal. The best-performing landing pages, measured by conversion rates, are almost always product-focused. They skip the fluff and show customers exactly what they came for—the offer, the product, and the reason to care. Check out our full collection of landing page templates and guides for every use case and industry. Landing pages built in Replo are not locked into rigid templates like many other ecommerce tools such as Shopify, so you can explore bold, custom designs that feel uniquely yours. This gives brands the flexibility to test and track every part of their page; you get to iterate towards scaling any conversion goal. How can Replo work with Headless setups, and how can we get started? Replo lets you choose between working inside your Shopify Theme or using a Headless setup to create a separate experience that integrates into the same ecommerce database. Learn more about how Replo works with Headless setups . With Replo Sites, your pages and sales funnels live on their own hosted domain or subdomain (such as shop.example.com ) making them fully headless and independcent from any existing ecommerce setup you may already have. This gives marketing teams a separate space to build campaigns, launch pages, or run A/B tests without touching the main store, usually drastically improving site performance. For teams that prefer to stay inside an existing platform like Shopify, Replo also supports building directly on Shopify themes using our Theme Builder. I want to set up pixel tracking and/or analytics for my Replo Sites pages, what do I do? Replo Sites integrates with all major analytics and ad platforms out of the box, including GA4, Meta, Snapchat, Google, Reddit, and more. After set up, the integration will apply to all pages on your site. Read more about how to set up integrations . Replo also supports cross-domain tracking with your Shopify checkout . For example, if your funnel links to a Shopify checkout page, sessions are automatically connected so you can see complete conversion paths. If you run into any issues setting up analytics and pixels on Replo, please directly reach out to our support team at support@replo.app and we’re happy to help you out!
