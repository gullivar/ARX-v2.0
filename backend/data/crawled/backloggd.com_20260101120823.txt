Popular reviews See More Kchewz BACKER reviewed Borderlands 4: Super Deluxe Edition Completed on PlayStation 5 Dec 14, 2025 For context: I played Borderlands 4 on the PS5 for about 50 hours. I have played through Borderlands 1, 2, 3, The Pre-Sequel & Tiny Tina Wonderlands. I have also played similar titles like Destiny, Destiny 2 & Rage 2. Borderlands 4 continues the franchise’s familiar first-person looter-shooter formula while refining several of its core systems. The experience feels like “more Borderlands” in the best way: fast-paced gunplay, constant loot drops, and a strong emphasis on co-op, though it remains perfectly playable solo. The game introduces a new cast of Vault Hunters, each with three distinct action skills instead of a single core ability. Playing as Rafa, the Axel Soldier, highlighted how varied these skills can be—ranging from robotic Hydras with homing missiles to electrified melee blades—though balance issues exist, with some abilities feeling far more situational or underpowered, especially during boss encounters. The open-world structure is one of Borderlands 4’s strongest upgrades. Rather than hopping between multiple planets, the game takes place on one massive, continuous world that feels more cohesive and alive. Quality-of-life improvements, like instantly summoning vehicles and dynamic “mini-boss bubble” events scattered across the map, help keep exploration engaging and rewarding. The main story is relatively short at around 20 hours, while side quests retain the series’ signature humor and encourage exploration. Despite very regular reports of performance issues at launch, I was very lucky to experience no issues on my PS5, except minor co-op hiccups reported by friends during long play sessions, where they started to lose visual and audio assets, alongside frame-rate dips. Overall, Borderlands 4 is a confident, polished entry that stands just below the series’ peak. While it doesn’t quite surpass Borderlands 2, it leaves a stronger impression than recent Borderlands titles. With a fun cast, solid world design, and promising future DLC, it feels like a great foundation for the franchise moving forward. Veterans will feel right at home, and newcomers can jump in without prior knowledge, making Borderlands 4 a strong recommendation for both long-time fans and first-time Vault Hunters.

A question that sets the tone for a game that has much more depth than it suggests. The word that comes to my mind is "Unique" and it perfectly describes Another Crab's Treasure, a much needed change of waters among the sea of trash soulslikes that have been coming out in recent years. Premise The story follows our protagonist Krill as he's chilling on the beach and suddenly gets his shell taken away, and now he needs to face his biggest fear in order to get it back, the sea . Tutorial And this is where our adventure starts, tutorials are important in difficult games like these, and Crab Souls does its job. It presents its mechanics to you gradually, it doesn't hold your hand too much but tells you everything you need to know and gives you time to absorb and test what you learnt before expanding its mechanics even further. Combat & Mechanics Like every soulslike a good combat is essential. Crab Souls gets it spot on, the combat is fun and rich in mechanics, there are a lot of similarities with Sekiro especially, you don't have a stamina bar, you can break enemy posture and you use the same weapon throughout the whole game. The shells are the bread and butter of the combat though, they're your armor, shield and also have different abilities, there are quite a lot of them to choose, including some funny ones like the Among Us one which I ended up using for a lot of my playthrough. The main ways to avoid damage are to dodge, hide in your shell or of course parry. You also obtain the main bosses' special ability after defeating them, there's a whole abilities tree, you can use your hook on enemies to either pull them to you or pull yourself to them, you can modify your weapon by sticking it in shells to make it stronger and I didn't even mention stats or stowaways. Honestly, I have seen a review here that said the combat is too simplistic... doesn't it just make you want to SHUCKING SCREEEAAAM?? Level Design So how about the level design? The game does an excellent job at capturing the souls feeling of being in a level surrounded by enemies, having no heals, you don't know where's the next bonfire and you don't want to lose your microplastics! The enemy placement and quantity is good, there's enough enemy variety and there's a lot of platforming in this game because well, the parkour works as intended you know? Spoilers ahead Areas & Bosses I would like to highlight some areas and bosses in particular, firstly Grovekeeper Topoda who might very well be the best boss in the game and is inspired by what might be the coolest species in the ocean, the Peacock Mantis Shrimp, these mussel shuckers pack a punch equivalent to the force of a .22 caliber bullet, so it goes without saying this boss is shucking cool! Floatsam Vale is not particularly the best area of the game, but there's something I'd like to mention, let's pretend you're playing Sekiro, a game about ninjas and samurais in Japan, when suddenly, you're faced with a poison swamp bruh, really? In Crab Souls poison swamps are actually coherent with the lore of the game and serve a purpose, they're not there just for the sake of being there! Roland is another super cool boss fight, the fact that it takes place in a pinball machine that both you and him can take advantage of and there's an audience watching and making sounds as you fight creates such a unique atmosphere, he's also based on such a cool creature, the Giant Isopod. After this fight we are taken to The Unfathom , this area stood out a lot for me, you're in the literal bottom of the ocean, pure darkness, the enemies you fight are also based on species that live in the extreme depths of the ocean. It reminds me of The Abyss in Dark Souls, in pretty much every souls game there's an area like this, but the setup for this one is just perfect. In this area we fight Inkerton which was the boss I struggled the most against by far, this squid was literally harder than Malenia for me, but unlike her, he actually felt fair and fun to fight against, it was definitely my own lack of ability holding me back here, he deals a lot of damage and his attacks have short dodging windows but he's vulnerable to parrying and has some clear punishing windows. Art Direction With The Old Ocean next, I'd like to touch on the game's art direction, which is simply peak, this area is absolutely stunning and it gives you that Anor Londo wow moment. Making a stylish world when what you're given is pollution and trash is not easy, but Crab Souls did it, this theme also matches so perfectly with gameplay elements when you consider that Krill is a hermit crab, and hermit crabs in real life do use trash as shells often. I need to give a shout out to the character designs also, they are insanely creative and charming, Nenma for example is literally wearing a newspaper and her hair is an orange peel, Konche has a nacho for a hat, and the enemies often use trash as weapons too such as straws or broken glass. Characters We already established the characters are charming but what about the writing? In short it's cod damn amazing, I think there's a crazy concept I need to talk about. The characters in this game, read carefully... They don't speak in riddles and actually form sentences that you can make sense of! Revolutionary I know. Jokes aside, that's actually such a positive aspect of the game, the characters are so charismatic and surprisingly have so much depth to them, Krill's character is amazing and suffers noticeable development throughout the game, Nenma is so charming and serves as this almost motherly figure to Krill, Chitan's a badass with her obsession with justice and getting stronger, she's also almost like a big sister to Krill, Firth is amazing too, I found him so charismatic even though he's a bit of a d*ckhead. Final Boss & Ending "If the world is ugly, then you need to fight. Fight to rip this ugly world apart." The whole game builds towards the final boss Praya Dubia, which synthesizes perfectly the whole lore of the game, in the 2nd half of the game you start hearing this voice, telling you these weird things about how the world is doomed and how you need to fight it, every creature who you fought and went mad also listened to this voice and gave in... Praya Dubia is also the name of a real species, the Giant Siphonophore, the longest animal on the planet that is actually a colony of tiny zooids who work as one, all of those crab souls, all of the rage, revolt and hopelessness they felt towards the world, comes together in what is the rage of Praya Dubia. The ending of the game just wraps everything up perfectly, and shows that after everything Krill has gone through in this journey, he did grow up as a hermit crab and changed his ways for the better. "But though history talks of warriors and heroes, and great mighty crabs that shook the world. It is the thankless deeds that shall ever make that world fighting for." Conclusion Believe it or not, there is a lot more I'd like to say about this amazing game, but I think the review is already long enough as it is! In sum, Another Crab's Treasure was a genius idea and the best soulslike I've played by a mile, it boasts creativity and an attention to detail that's exceedingly rare, for what is Aggro Crab's 2nd game they absolutely nailed it. It's rare to find a game that has so much personality and is so well polished, Crab Souls is a must play for everyone! 25 Likes 0 Open review DJSCheddar reviewed Thief: Deadly Shadows Played on Windows PC Dec 19, 2025 I was pleased to find that, despite some big changes, this was still classic THIEF at its core. Unfortunately, game-breaking bugs, tons of very transparent padding in otherwise good levels, and especially the terrible overworld stuff keep this far under the level of the other two. 6 Likes 0 Open review Sitara BACKER reviewed Your Wings My Wings Completed Dec 19, 2025 Played for 2025 Gaming Advent Calendar made by yours truly I'm also tracking the games in this list Editor's note - I have been reflecting on this game a lot, the genre as a whole, and spoken to a friend at length about it. After doing so, I want to change my review, something I normally don't do. My score is still the same because it reflects my experience, but I think I need to provide more context to people that I may have steered away from this game unfairly. I will leave my entire old review up below this for posterity and for integrity's sake. New thoughts I was not aware originally that this game was made for a game jam. Had I known, I would have judged it a lot differently, and that is my failing for not knowing that as I'm sure it was clearly labeled as such on itch. Second, I want to state that I know this is a game review site, and this is categorized as a game, and that its hard to sometimes see the nuance in this medium. The line between VN and Game is not one I'm going to draw for you. Or for this dev even. But I do think that sometimes, our mentality matters, and we need to approach this genre more from the lens of it being a book than a game. This game falls into that lens and I didn't treat it as such. I also want to state that I put this in my advent calendar, as stated before - The nature of having a game a day to play made me far less thoughtful about a lot of my reviews, and this game should not be judged on the fact that it was included without its consent in such an experiment. All that said, all my criticisms and praises for the game I wrote in my original review still stand. But I want to acknowledge I didn't do a good job encapsulating why someone might actually want to play this game or might be drawn to it, but rather, just sort of said "not for me, could be for you". So let me explain a bit more what its like so people can decide better for themselves. You might be asking why I'm bothering with any of this at all, but the truth is, my review will probably be the top review for this niche little project for a long time. I don't think its fair to have such a labor of love have its more popular review steering people towards or away from it when the review I wrote doesn't do it justice. Anyway, with that said! Your Wings My Wings, to paraphrase my friend, is a game about a queer mad scientist obsessed with FFX. The artstyle is innocent, childlike, and utilizes different styles and techniques throughout, which I think are a really big strength. Though I originally described it as verbose, I should mention that perhaps that's a bit unfair - I felt this way more because I found the game hard to read, in terms of font, scaling, colors, and general readability. That probably added to my struggle. However, all those choices are part of it's aesthetic if you will, and my friend did mention they could change the font and styling to be more readable, so there's ways around it which is nice. The game is charming, and I do think that if you like more poetic stories that are less linear/prose, or you like when things are a bit less standard and demand more attention from the reader, then this VN will probably speak to you deeply. However, if you approach this as a game and not a novel, and expect something more than a game jam project from it, then its probably not going to be one that lands for you. I hope this review is a bit more fair to the experience I think people will get from it, and I do encourage people to try it first and make up their own minds rather than go on my word alone - and also, I hope that this review and some of my other reviews in this advent calendar will help people broaden their perspective on the VN genre a bit more, as I've gotten a much better understanding an appreciation for it the more I've sat with my experiences playing them. Old Review: Just kind of not for me. I like yuri a lot but this just didn't really connect with me at all. I think it had its own really unique style of dialogue and the art style was very childlike but added to the overall feel of the game so I mostly enjoyed those aspects. However, I do feel the game was quite verbose and it's not even that long. Some people are gonna absolutely love this game, but I kind of walked away wondering what I just did for the last 5 minutes because I don't really feel like I experienced any real story or message. Nor did I actually feel anything emotionally. I'm not even sure what emotions this is supposed to be conveying, but perhaps that's just because its not a game that I can personally relate to but others can, which is fine. TL;DR - Not my thing, may be yours, who knows. It's free and has unique art. 62 Likes 1 Open review Latest news See Past Articles Personalized Covers | 1.16 Update Become your own poster curator Nov 29, 2025 Popular lists What I'm looking forward to in 2026 by ShawnRazor | 16 Games Ranking the Game Awards Orchestral Performances by FlowerBoyT | 7 Games LOOKS LIKE MENU'S BACK ON THE MENU, BOYS! by willn46 | 20 Games Coming soon See More SSR Wives: The Murder Of My Winter Crush Jan  1 Margaritari Jan  1 BrebeMan Jan  1 Axyn Adventure Jan  1 TR-49 Jan  1 Dice A Million Jan  1 Recently anticipated Control Resonant Dec 31 Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Dec 31 Resident Evil Requiem Feb 27 Tomb Raider: Catalyst Dec 31 2027 Ontos Dec 31 Marvel's Wolverine Dec 31 Sleeper hits Terminator 2D: No Fate Avg 3.5★ Bits & Bops Avg 3.9★ Angeline Era Avg 4.2★ Sektori Avg 4.2★ SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide Avg 3.6★ Shelldiver Avg 3.7★ Submit feedback on the home page About Contact Backers Roadmap Terms Privacy Update cookie preferences © Backloggd LLC • v1.16.2 • Powered by IGDB Log a Game Warning Verify your password to continue: Incorrect -- try again Cookies allow us to enhance our services.
