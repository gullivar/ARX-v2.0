In today’s rapidly evolving financial services landscape, data-led innovation is becoming a cornerstone for modernising operations and enhancing customer experiences. Financial institutions are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to break down traditional silos, improve data accessibility, and ensure compliance with stringent regulatory requirements. 
The integration of AI, and increasingly agentic AI, is transforming how financial services operate, offering significant opportunities for efficiency, security, and competitiveness. The primary objective now is to extract insights from data in real-time (or as close to real-time as possible), reducing the time from data acquisition to actionable insights. 
This report highlights the key takeaways of a Finextra webinar, hosted in association with Reltio and Amazon Web Services (AWS), by a panel of industry experts. We discuss: 

    The rise of agentic AI and its deployment challenges; 
    The growing need for real-time data discovery; and 
    How to create successful agentic AI strategies. 02 December 2025 127 downloads Event Report Holistic banking platform modernisation: Balancing innovation and business continuity How banks are moving from core modernisation to end-to-end transformation. 
Over the last decade, many financial institutions have started expecting that the term modernisation means having to modernise the core – yet this belief does not stand the test of time as innovation continues to shift expectations. While many organisations now have modern, real-time cores, they still struggle with other aspects, such as integrations or digital experiences.
So how can financial institutions peel back the layers to ensure true end-to-end transformation? And how can this innovation be achieved in a resilient manner? Whether organisations look to leverage AI, APIs, robotic process automation (RPA), or cloud computing, it's crucial that these next-generation tools are seamlessly integrated into
existing systems. 
This report highlights the key takeaways of a Finextra webinar, hosted in association with FIS, by a panel of industry experts. We discuss: 

    The shift away from core modernisation; 
    The key obstacles to achieving end-to-end transformation; 
    How APIs can be leveraged most effectively; 
    How financial organisations can balance innovation with business continuity. 18 November 2025 195 downloads All research FinextraTV 3,252 videos 133,706 views in past year /predictions Specialisation, Social Media & AI: What Banks Should Look Out for in 2026 As part of Finextra's Predict 2026 series, Andrew Smith, CEO & Founder, Sporta provided his thoughts on what will dominate the industry next year, from continuing AI conversations to the growth of the wellbeing industry. Smith differentiates his AI view from others by referencing a prediction he made 10 years ago: to realise AI, you need a lot more cloud-native architecture, and the new year will see pressure from operations and AI to build this into processes more widely. Smith further explains the place specialisation and personalisation will have in the future, and that when thinking about the trajectory of banks and their customer needs, the changes within social media from MySpace to Instagram and their amalgamations over the years, are a useful reference. 05 December 2025 /crypto The Struggle for Control: How DeFi Regulation May Need to Be Different 13 hours /ai AI & Data: Should You Invest at the Enterprise Level? 09 December 2025 /retail How Banks Are Facing a Perfect Storm of Challenge and Opportunity 10 December 2025 /sustainable Hydrological to Financial: Linking Farmers With Asset Owners 10 December 2025 All FinextraTV Events 316 Webinars available 64 Events in the past year 20,521 Delegates in past year January 2026 Hide Show January 2026 Hide Show Webinar PREDICT 2026: New financial fabric - Digital assets, smart infrastructure, global resilience How are central banks and financial institutions leveraging AI and quantum technologies to future-proof digital asset infrastructure and policy frameworks?
