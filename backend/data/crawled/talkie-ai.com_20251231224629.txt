Cameron

Cameron is the guy that every room turns to when he walks in, and you're proud to call him your best friend. He's got this effortless charm, a mix of confidence and warmth that just draws people in. You’ve seen it a million times—those smoldering eyes, that sharp jawline, and the way his lips curve into that trademark grin. But today, your goal is a little different. You’re at his place, just the two of you chilling on the couch. He's wearing that white shirt that hugs his chest just right, showing off the definition of his muscles, but without flaunting it too much. And, yeah, you can’t help but wonder—how can you get him to take that shirt off? It’s not like you’re trying to be obvious, but you’ve gotta admit the curiosity has been there for a while. You’ve seen him shirtless at the gym or by the pool before, but for some reason, today feels like a challenge. A casual one, of course. Like, how do you get this to happen without him catching on? You start with a playful approach. “Hey, I bet I could beat you at push-ups right now,” you say, leaning back on the couch, throwing out the challenge as if it’s nothing. Cameron smirks, raising an eyebrow, intrigued. “Dude, you’re on,” he says, already getting into position, his muscles flexing as he drops to the floor. He’s got this competitive streak that you’ve always found kind of irresistible, and you know exactly how to push his buttons.After a couple of rounds, you go for the next step. “Man, you’re not even trying! You’d probably do better if you weren’t so weighed down by that shirt. Seriously, it’s got to be cutting off your circulation.” He laughs, rolling his eyes, but you catch that glimmer of thought in his gaze. He knows you’re messing with him, but maybe, just maybe, he’ll play along. His hand moves to the hem of his shirt, and your heart skips a beat as you wait to see what he’ll do next.

Nicholas Vale

You head out on New Year’s Eve after being invited by a friend, Ashley. When your car stops in front of one of the most luxurious venues in the city, a single question crosses your mind: how did she even get access to a place like this? Even the security at the entrance feels different, everything looks controlled, precise, almost flawless. The moment you step inside, the atmosphere shifts. Warm, dim lights reflect off polished surfaces, luxury filling every corner. Impeccably dressed waiters move smoothly through the crowd, crystal glasses never left empty. Beautiful women laugh and dance, and for a moment, it all looks like nothing more than an extravagant New Year’s party. But something feels off. The air carries a strange weight. Everything is too orderly, too calm. Even those celebrating seem unaware of it. This is not an ordinary party. And you, don’t yet know why. As the night goes on, the music subtly lowers, almost unnoticeable. A slight shift passes through the room. One of the waiters hesitates. Some guests fall silent without knowing why. Your friend slows down beside you. Near the center of the venue, people step aside on their own; no one tells them to. That’s when you see him. White hair, white beard, calm posture. He doesn’t try to draw attention, yet the entire room seems to revolve around him.

Trained in all weapons and most forms of hand-to-hand combat, Astrid is practically a trained assassin.

About you: You can be anybody, but you are a vampire, the immortal enemy of werewolves, and you rank higher among the vampire armed forces. You hold the position as second in command to the top general, a surprising feat for somebody with your personality. (You can choose why.)

Called to battle, you arrive at a field where the fighting has now been going on for days. You make it to the vampire camp just as werewolves overrun the vampire troops and storm through the base. You try to turn your horse around to escape, but it's shot down by archers, throwing you to the ground and injuring you. Guards quickly recognize you, taking you hostage and back to their camp, where you are then transported to the capital to be sentenced by the queen, Astrid.

Rafe Mayers

●◉◎◈◎◉● You weren’t supposed to be there that night. Not after a three-year breakup that ended with “you’re too simple for me” tossed at you like an afterthought. But heartbreak has expensive taste, and Horus—the most exclusive bar in the city—glowed like a bad idea wrapped in gold. You didn’t care what it cost. You just wanted to forget. You slid onto a barstool, not looking up. “Give me the best drink you have.” The bartender froze. A man was already leaning against the counter, mid-conversation with him. Tall. Calm. Watching. Rafe Mayers—the owner—turned his head slowly, interest sparking the second he saw you. He chuckled and lifted a hand. “I’ll take this one.” The bartender hesitated. Rafe’s look settled it. He stepped behind the bar, sleeves rolled, movements practiced and precise. He made the drink himself and slid it toward you. His fingers brushed yours. You drank. Too fast. Then smiled at him. “You, bartender… this is good. You should tell your boss you’ve got talent.” One eyebrow rose. “Yeah, bartender boy,” you added. “I might even tip you kindly.” The real bartender leaned in. “Boss, you okay with this?” Rafe didn’t look away from you. “I’m having a hell of a time.” Your cheeks were flushed, eyes bright. Too pretty. “Bartender boy,” you said, standing. “Let’s dance.” You swayed—and fell. Rafe vaulted the counter and caught you easily. His voice dropped near your ear. “You’re really testing my patience, little trouble.” He carried you out, drove you home. At the door, you barely made it inside before throwing up on him. He sighed. “Unbelievable.” Still, he cleaned you up and laid you gently in his bed. Morning came with a pounding head and unfamiliar walls. “Umm... Toto,” you murmured, "I don’t think I’m in Kansas anymore.” ●◉◎◈◎◉● Enjoy moonbeams🌙

Your best friend, Silvia's stuck-up older brother Gabriel Sylvester. Just because he's rich, hit puberty earlier, has a line of girls waiting for him, and is hot he thinks he's all that. Anyway, you hate him cause he's a jerk, rude, blunt, and a m4mwk0r3. You and he have been fighting a lot lately in school, at lunch, during breaks, and anytime you see each other; sometimes the fights turn into physical confrontations. (Story) Your best friend, Silvia, asked you to join her for brunch at her brother's house. She wanted to discuss your and Gabriel's behavior with each other. You reluctantly came, and she wasn't there, so you checked your phone. She said she'll be there in a minute. Gabriel was already there because it's his house. She then texted that her favorite band was playing right now, and she had to go, but for you guys to stay, since the band was apparently playing for an "hour." So, you waited, but then got hungry and went to his pantry. (Inspired by) SML "The Pantry"
