Drift

Convert Website Visitors Into Pipeline

Drift AI Chat agent engages visitors with real-time personalized conversations, delivering a better buyer experience and more qualified leads.

4.5 on G2

Faster revenue growth starts here

The Drift Chat agent brings deeper insights to marketers and earlier buyer engagement to sellers — driving efficiency across the entire revenue motion to accelerate growth.

Challenge #1: Unmet buyer expectations

Improve the buying experience

Provide accurate and instant answers to your site visitors’ questions with AI chat agents. Personalized AI conversations keep prospects engaged, reduce drop-off, and accelerate sales cycles by instantly qualifying leads and letting buyers book meetings or chat live with a rep.

 

Challenge #2: Lack of visibility into intent-based web traffic

Deanonymize site visitors

When a prospect lands on your website, you'll know who they are. Drift identifies high-intent buyers and relevant account data (like company name, location, and account history, etc.), scores their engagement in real time, and delivers the right chat experience to convert them.

Challenge #3: Lengthy and disconnected sales cycles

Drive more qualified pipeline faster

When visitors from high-intent accounts interact with Drift, the Drift Chat agent intelligently routes qualified buyers into the seller’s Rhythm workflow as a prioritized action, giving sellers a clear next step and the context they need to deliver personalized, timely communication. 

Challenge #4: Not knowing which chats convert

Optimize your chat strategy

Track engagement metrics, identify high-converting conversations, and attribute success to pipeline and revenue to continuously set strategic benchmarks and refine your approach for better performance.

What customers say about Drift

We've seen positive impacts across all stages of the buyer's journey from Drift, owing to meaningful personalization. We've improved website conversion, sourced incremental leads, and accelerated the sales process. Drift is now one of our most-loved martech tools.

Steve Measelle
VP of Marketing Global Performance & Strategy

I think the results speak for themselves. Drift has turned into the number one channel for high-intent leads.

Heather Alter
Senior Director of Web Experience

A solution like Drift gives you multiple new opportunities to convert users into your pipeline

Thomas Grünberg
Director of Global Campaigns

When our site visitors engage with chat, they now get better, more thorough responses — even though it takes our team less time to set up and manage the [Drift] chatbot

Alla Mosina
Website Product Manager

[Drift is] bridging that gap between us trying to call or email at the ‘right time’ as opposed to knowing they’re live on the site, ready to talk.

Roland Brickey
Director of Marketing Operations

Drift has allowed us to become more customer-centric, even in the B2B space where we have to solve customer problems on their time, not ours.

FAQs
What is conversational AI and how does it work in marketing?

Conversational AI uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to simulate human-like conversations with customers. In marketing, it engages website visitors in real-time, answers questions, and guides them through personalized experiences, improving lead generation and customer satisfaction.

How can chat agents improve sales and lead qualification?

Chat agents powered by conversational AI can instantly qualify leads by asking preset questions, capturing key data, and routing high-intent visitors to sales reps. This speeds up the sales cycle, reduces friction, and helps businesses engage qualified buyers at the right moment.

What are the benefits of conversational marketing for B2B businesses?

Conversational marketing enables real-time, personalized interactions with prospects, creating a more engaging buying experience. By using AI-powered chat agents, B2B companies can automate lead qualification, improve customer support, and accelerate the sales process.

How does Drift’s conversational AI help improve buyer engagement?

Drift’s AI-powered chat agents engage buyers in meaningful, brand-aligned conversations 24/7. By instantly qualifying leads and routing them to live chats or meetings, Drift ensures that high-intent buyers are engaged in real time, increasing conversion rates and shortening sales cycles.

Can chat agents integrate with my existing sales tools?

Yes, Drift’s conversational AI integrates seamlessly with sales tools like Salesloft, allowing your team to act on buyer signals instantly. This integration ensures that valuable insights from chat agents interactions are automatically synced with your CRM and sales workflow for a smoother process.
