The 31 coolest streets in the world in 2025
If you really want to experience local life at its most authentic when exploring a new city, the best thing you can do is take to the streets. And no, not that one major thoroughfare with the samey high street megastores and generic coffee shops. We’re talking about the neighbourhood backstreets and lively avenues that locals love; the places packed with independent shops and creative people, where a brand-new hi-fi listening bar will share the space with an old-school grocer or a centuries-old pub.  This year, to create our annual ranking of the world’s coolest streets, we asked our global network of local editors and experts to nominate the street that epitomises the very best of their city. Time Out’s global travel team then narrowed down the list and ranked each street against criteria including food, drink, culture, fun and community spirit.  From Saturday samba sessions in Rio de Janeiro to a shapeshifting shopping street in Osaka, every avenue, alleyway and side street on this year’s ranking is unique to its hometown. Walking their length is like taking a stroll through the city in miniature, getting a taste of what makes life there brilliant – from food and culture to shopping and nightlife.  Did your favourite street make the list? Read on to find out.

The 39 coolest neighbourhoods in the world in 2025
For the past eight years, we’ve made it our mission to scope out the coolest pockets of the world’s greatest cities in order to create our definitive annual ranking. The places where stuff like nightlife, art, culture, and affordable food and drink can be found on every corner and down every backstreet. Where diversity is championed and independent businesses thrive, from old-school boltholes to the newest avant-garde art space. Put simply, the world’s coolest neighbourhoods are places that represent the soul of our cities, while maintaining their own unique local character that draws people in to live, work and play. So, what are the neighbourhoods that fit the bill this year? To find out, we asked our network of writers and editors across a breadth of cities to nominate the vibiest district in their hometown right now. We then ranked every neighbourhood against criteria including culture, community, liveability, nightlife, food and drink, street life and that hard-to-define sense of ‘nowness’.  On our list this year, you’ll find everything from homely, village-like enclaves with tight-knit communities to revitalised city-centre hubs and formerly dormant, industrial areas transformed into creative districts. Many are underrated spots that sit in the shadow of their commercialised counterparts; others have become unexpected culinary hotspots or magnets for the city’s artists, writers and activists. What they all have in common is a DIY spirit – and an unshakeable proclivity for ingenuity and fun. Get ready to debate – these are the 39 coolest neighbourhoods on the planet right now.  RECOMMENDED:🌆 The world’s greatest cities in 2025🪩 The best cities for nightlife right now🍴 The best cities for food right now🖼️ The world’s culture capitals in 2025
