Document We're happy to share some big news with you! In June 2020, Content Insights merged with real-time analytics solution SmartOcto and
                formed a new company under the name smartocto . The merger came after almost two years of working on some groundbreaking joint research: how to predict
                the conversion of content, and calculate real-time actionable tips. The result of this effort - what we call the Story Value Engine - is considered to be a big step towards making media more
                profitable. Read more about the
                    merger on our new website. Content Insights solutions are now an integral part of the smartocto suite of products covering all
                aspects of the story lifecycle under a new name smartocto insights. We are still fully committed to giving you the level of support you expect and deserve from us, so feel
                free to get in touch with us if you have any questions. LOGIN Terms of service Privacy policy
