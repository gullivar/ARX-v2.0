This domain is operated by driftnet.io. It is used to discover and measure services that network owners and operators have publicly exposed.

Traffic from this domain is not an attack. Traffic from this domain will never attempt to log in to your systems.

Spam is not sent from this domain. SPF, DKIM and DMARC records mark internet-measurement.com as completely unable to send email.

Problem Reports

If particular probes technically or operationally problematic for you, let us know: problems@driftnet.io.

We read, investigate and take action on reports. If we are causing unusual noise in your logs, please tell us and we'll try to do better.

Some security products incorrectly mark our traffic as malicious. Please contact your vendor for a fix.

We don't perform any form of site crawling. Authentic traffic will come only from our IP ranges.

Viewing your Network

Network administrators may freely obtain an external view of their network at driftnet.io.

Opting Out

To opt out, block our IP ranges.

You may also opt out by sending your IP ranges and/or domain names to optout@driftnet.io. We will also need some reasonable method of authenticating you as the end-user of those IPs: an email sent from an address listed in public WHOIS is preferred. If that isn't possible, get in touch and we can suggest alternate methods.

We aim to process requests quickly. We block senders of abusive, profane or threatening messages.
