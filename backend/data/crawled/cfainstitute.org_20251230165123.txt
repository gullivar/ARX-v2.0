The CFA Program really goes in deep about a lot of different topics in finance. I think it provides people with a really good grounding across a lot of different topics. The biggest piece of advice I would give to people who want to try the program or who are worried because they don't have a background in finance is just give it a go. I found the program really great, I enjoyed the content, I enjoyed the process, and I also enjoyed meeting other people who have done the program.
