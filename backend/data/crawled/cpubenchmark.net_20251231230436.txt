							have posted to its web site and produced a comprehensive range of CPU charts to
							help compare the relative speeds of different processors from Intel, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm and others. Included in these lists are CPUs designed for servers and workstations
							(such as Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC processors), desktop CPUs
							(Intel Core Series and AMD Ryzen), in addition to ARM processors
							(Apple M1 and Qualcomm Snapdragon) and mobile CPUs. cpus Multithread Page: 1, 2, 3, 4 Single Thread Page: 1, 2, 3, 4 Best Value (On Market) Best Value XY Scatter Best Value (All time) New Desktop New Laptop New Server New Mobile Systems with Multiple CPUs Overclocked Power Performance CPU Mark by Socket Type Cross-Platform CPU Performance Top Gaming CPUs CPU Mega List Search Model Compare 0 Common Most Benchmarked AMD vs Intel Market Share Year on Year Performance Minimize _ Add CPUs to start comparisons Compare the performance of up to 5 different CPUs Compare List Add other CPU: Compare Most Popular Benchmarks Search for your CPU Model Multithread CPU Chart Best Value (All time) CPU Chart Single Thread CPU Chart Best Value Best Value CPU Chart (On Market) Best Value CPU XY Scatter Best Value (All time) CPU Chart Latest and hottest New Desktop CPUs Chart New Laptop CPUs Chart New Server CPUs Chart New Mobile/Embedded CPUs Chart Common CPU Chart Most Benchmarked (90 Days) CPUs Specific Performance Single Thread CPU Chart Systems with Multiple CPUs Overclocked CPU Chart Power Performance CPU Chart CPU Mark by Socket Type Cross-Platform CPU Performance Top Gaming CPU Chart Trends AMD vs Intel Market Share Year on Year CPU Performance Number of CPU Cores Search & Compare CPU Mega List Page with Filters Search for your CPU Model Compare CPUs Historical PerformanceTest V9 archived CPU List Benchmark Test Description CPU Benchmark results (“Baselines”) were gathered from
									users’ submissions
										to the PassMark web site as well as from internal testing.
									PerformanceTest conducts eight different tests and then averages the results
									together
									to determine the CPU Mark rating for a system. To ensure that the full CPU power of a PC system is realized,
									PerformanceTest runs each CPU test on all available CPUs. Specifically,
									PerformanceTest
									runs one simultaneous CPU test for every logical CPU (Hyper-threaded);
									physical CPU core (dual core) or physical CPU package (multiple CPU chips).
									So
									hypothetically if you have a PC that has two CPUs, each with dual cores that
									use hyper-threading, then PerformanceTest will run eight simultaneous
									tests.... [ Read the entire article ] Notes Related to the Graphs Rarely is a graph completely accurate in what it is representing. There are
									many factors that can skew the results and make a graph misleading. As such
									it is necessary to have some background understanding of the data being
									presented. In the case of these CPU Benchmarks there are several factors to consider,
									such as different OS’s the CPU’s are running on and the
									possibility
									that users have overclocked their systems.... [ Learn

									31st of December 2025 How to Add Your Own CPU Download and install PerformanceTest. Start PerformanceTest then from the menu bar select "Tests->Run All
									Tests". Once the tests have run select "Baseline->Upload Baseline to Web". Your results will not appear in the graphs immediately as the graphs are
									only updated once per day.
									Additionally, only CPUs of which there are at least two samples are included
									in the graphs.
