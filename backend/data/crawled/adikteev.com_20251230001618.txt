Adikteev has been a partner we can rely on from setup to execution of our retargeting campaigns. They have advised us on the best strategy for our users, and taken our perspective into account when it comes to which users to target. We’re also extremely pleased with their incrementality testing abilities, and have gotten a real sense of our campaign performance as a result.

Rola Nubani

UA Manager | @ Clawee

Our initial campaign focus was ROAS, but we decided to switch over to measuring incrementality which we feel shows the real value of retargeting. Adikteev made this change possible thanks to their versatility and custom approach. They were able to help us change directions while still maintaining campaign performance.
