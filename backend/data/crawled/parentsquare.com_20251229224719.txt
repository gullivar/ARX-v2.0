“Our parents love ParentSquare. It has helped to streamline communication and keep all important information in one spot. During a Town Hall meeting, we had a parent tell us how thankful she was because she did not have space on her phone for all the different apps and now she can communicate with her children’s teachers and find out what time practice is, all in one place.”
Nicholette Klingensmith
Director of Technology & Student Learning
Honeoye Central School (NY)
“ParentSquare is the best tool we’ve invested in all year. It’s raised the quality of our communication with our families and best of all, our parents, teachers, and staff all love it! The user experience is well thought out and the product speaks for itself.”
Leah Davis
Executive Director
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (NC)
“ParentSquare is hands-down the best investment our district has made when it comes to engaging and communicating with students, parents and staff. We have been able to raise the reach and frequency to our stakeholders. Our principals and school office supervisors all rave about its ease of use, and our families appreciate the various ways in which to receive info via posts, emails, texts, app, website or calls.”
Marci McFadden
Chief of Staff / Chief of Communications and Community Engagement
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District (CA)
“Parent Square has improved the contactability of parents to over 90%. Most respond to text message as opposed to emails. Having them sign online removes the paper clutter and we don't have to rely on students to bring the forms back. Teachers and administrators have direct communication to all parents. We love it!”
Dr. Margaret Stroud
Superintendent
The Varnett Public School (TX)
“We officially migrated recently and we love ParentSquare – everyone thinks it is really easy to use. And, no need to boot up your laptop just to send out a message – just use the app! We are also using their translation setting for our ELL families, with languages like Nepali, Kinyarwanda, and Swahili, and a local translator reports that the translations are 'perfect'!”
