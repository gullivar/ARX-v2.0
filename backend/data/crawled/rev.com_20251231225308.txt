Trusted When It Matters Most Rev provides a secure case analysis platform trusted in courtrooms and investigations nationwide. “One of the things I did with Rev, and it seems simple, but it would've taken me three hours to do it, is we needed to know every medical provider that she saw in two trips to the hospital. I had the medical records loaded, I clicked on 'em. I said, tell me the names and position of every medical provider that the victim saw during her two hospital visits. It gave me a list of 75 people, and it did it in a minute.” -Scott Lawson Investigative Paralegal “Rev has a great vision of where to go in the future. They're leading the way in this space, in the legal space, and it's needed…You have to have a technology that people trust. And Rev is great at developing that trust with their clients so that they can do the job that's needed.” -Mark Ivey, Founder eDepositions “Rev is such an important tool of my practice because it has cut down on the time I spend going through evidence. It's made it so much easier to process evidence, to present information at trial. I wish I found it sooner because it would've saved me so much time.” -Brian Anderson Anderson Law LLC “We were in trial this week and had a real-world opportunity to utilize Rev in a high-stress environment. I was able to use Rev to successfully cross-examine witnesses by leveraging the transcripts, video synced with transcripts, and various other features to effectively impeach testimony. While it's possible to do this with other technologies, it's much harder and requires a gazillion more hours of prep. Rev is a very cool product for trial lawyers.” -Adam Levin, Criminal Defense Attorney Swingle & Levin Own The Facts. Pursue The Truth.
