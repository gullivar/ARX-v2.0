I didn't have to walk forever or drive around trying to find a spot. Ed A. | Phoenix, AZ Outstanding parking. I am glad I used ParkWhiz. Made me feel like a VIP for only 12 bucks. Carl N. | Phoenix, AZ I have never been in and out of a parking garage after a concert so fast…Best experience in a parking garage ever. Brooke C. | Philadelphia, PA I do not head to Boston concerts or events without ParkWhiz! Search, reserve, pay, park, it's that easy. Heather P. | Boston, MA Normally I pay around $50 for parking in Chicago, but with ParkWhiz I was able to get a spot for $18 downtown. The price you see is the price you pay! Travis C. | Chicago, IL I completely forgot how much of a hassle parking gets and was in a rush…Using ParkWhiz, I found a spot and was there within seconds!
