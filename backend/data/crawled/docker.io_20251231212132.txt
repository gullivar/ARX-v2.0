Upgrade to DHI Enterprise for SLAs, customization, and compliance, with extended lifecycle support for EOL images available as an add-on. Learn more about Docker Hardened Images Apache 2.0 freedom Docker Hardened Images are fully open source and free to use, share, and build on, with no licensing surprises and complete transparency. Minimal and distroless images Ultra-minimal distroless Debian and Alpine images that remove everything you don’t need, shrinking footprint and attack surface by up to 97%. Up to 95% CVE reduction Eliminate vulnerabilities before they reach production with continuously rebuilt images from Docker’s hardened pipeline and verified SBOMs. Extended Lifecycle Support for long-term protection Add-on protection after upstream support ends, with multi-year CVE patches, updated SBOMs, and verifiable provenance that eliminate long windows of unpatched risk. Start secure, customize easily Add your own tools, packages, certificates, or settings while inheriting Docker’s hardened pipeline, signed builds, and secure defaults. 1000+ images and applications Continuously growing catalog of FIPS and STIG ready languages, frameworks, databases, application images and Helm charts, all signed and verified with SLA-backed security. The easiest, most secure way to run MCP for your LLMs Docker MCP makes it easy for AI agents to securely call MCP servers. Run verified MCP servers as containers and leverage Docker’s built-in security, isolation, and reliability. Explore 250+ MCP servers All your MCP tools in one place Search, deploy, and safely connect to hundreds of tools, in seconds. Docker handles setup, authentication, and security so you can focus on building agents, not managing them. Launch-ready MCP servers + clients Access 200+ verified MCP servers for tools like Stripe, Notion, GitHub, and more. Connect instantly to clients such as Claude and Cursor with one-click setup and no dependency conflicts. Security you don’t have to think about Automatically stop emerging threats like Rug Pulls and Tool Poisoning. Every MCP server is signed and verified by Docker, with runtime isolation and access controls protecting your agents and data by default. Your full agentic stack. Just one command away. Define and run agents, models, and tools with Docker Compose. Orchestrate your entire agentic stack in a single file, then launch with one command. Create Your First Agent Compose for agents Run agents like you run apps. Spin up your full agentic stack with `docker compose up`. Deploy anywhere: locally, across clouds, or on Docker Cloud. Deploy anywhere Build and refine custom models locally. Orchestrate multi-agent systems. Then deploy anywhere: on your machine, across clouds, or on Docker Cloud. Security out of the box Every model, gateway, and tool runs in a trusted, signed container, isolating each component for built-in security and provenance. In the ever-evolving realm of AI, consistency is key. With Docker, we’ve achieved a level of reproducibility that ensures our AI models perform optimally, irrespective of where they are deployed. Dr. Sebastian Rhode Software Architect – AI Solutions, Staff Expert at Zeiss Microscopy The simplest way to build and run software. Anywhere. Everything you need to build, test, and ship applications, fast, repeatably, and securely. Turn “it works on my machine” into “it works everywhere.” Containerize Your Applications Download for Mac – Apple Silicon Download for Mac – Intel Chip Download for Windows – AMD64 Download for Windows – ARM64 Download for Linux Everything you need to build locally Spin up containers, define multi-service apps, and test end-to-end on your machine. Power your workflow with the platform trusted by millions. Security built in, confidence by default Hardened Docker Desktop enforces organizational policies and stops malicious payloads and runtime exploits, without slowing developers down. Start from trusted content Access the world’s largest library of verified, signed container images on Docker Hub. Ship faster with a secure, reliable starting point. Docker gave us more than containers. It gave us control. Now, every developer has a consistent, secure environment, and we ship confidently every day. Dheeraj Arani Head of DevOps at InCred Frictionless for devs, secure for teams, a joy for everyone “You’re not having to pay a security team to do all the things required for securing a container image because it’s already being done for you. The images are trusted, the software verified for minimal CVEs.” Cameron Griffin Sr. Cloud Security Engineer at GuidePoint Security Watch video Security and speed are not a paradox anymore Now free for all developers . Docker delivers enterprise security without slowing developers. Hardened images, automated scans, and verified provenance turn open source into your advantage. Five pillars of supply chain security Docker’s approach rests on five pillars: minimal images, signed provenance, complete SBOMs, VEX insights, and transparent verification. Discover Docker’s approach Run Helm charts, hardened by Docker Use Helm charts powered by Docker Hardened Images to deploy secure, compliant Kubernetes apps with confidence. Explore Helm Charts in Docker Hub Join the move to a safer container ecosystem DHI is now free for everyone. Start building with hardened, distroless, provenance-verified images trusted by teams across the world. Learn core concepts of Docker security Get access to industry-leading CVE remediation SLA 30-day free trial Sign in to try DHI Enterprise “We evaluated multiple options for hardened base images and chose Docker Hardened Images (DHI) for its alignment with our supply chain security posture, developer tooling compatibility, Docker’s maturity in this space, and integration with our existing infrastructure. Our focus was on balancing trust, maintainability, and ecosystem compatibility.” Vikram Sethi Principal Scientist at Adobe Accelerate every workflow. From apps to agents. The fastest path from idea to running software. Whether you’re building agents or containers. Start building with Docker Desktop Build once, run anywhere From your first line of code to production, containers make every environment consistent so you can move faster, debug less, and ship more confidently. Containers + MCP: better together Spin up and connect to containerized MCP servers like GitHub or Browserbase in seconds, right from Docker Desktop. Build smarter agents faster with no setup. From client to server: the new kinds Build smarter agents faster by spinning up and connecting to MCP servers. Interface with them with your favorite clients like Cursor or Claude directly from Docker Desktop. “Docker enables us to do so much, and it’s constantly improving. And every time I look at the docs, I’m like, this is new. I didn’t know about this.” Sanchita Agarwal Senior Software Engineer at Cloudflare Share AI agents just like you share containers. Docker Hub now hosts MCP servers, AI models, and agent blueprints, alongside 20 million containers. Find what you need. Publish what you’ve built.
