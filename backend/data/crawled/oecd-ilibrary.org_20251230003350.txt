Environmental Outlook on the Triple Planetary Crisis
Climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution – the three elements of what is now called the triple planetary crisis – are a growing risk to human health, the environment and the economy. While these challenges are intimately linked, policy responses have traditionally operated in silos, presenting an opportunity for more integrated action. This OECD Environmental Outlook examines the biophysical impacts of the triple planetary crisis before developing projections for the evolution of its interlocking drivers, environmental pressures and states to mid-century.  The Outlook also presents an in-depth analysis of the policy linkages among climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. An analytical framework is first developed to examine synergies and trade-offs between policy responses to the three challenges. This is followed by a first-of-its-kind stocktake examining the extent to which policy linkages are addressed in national documents. This high-level analysis is complemented by deep dives on how key synergies and trade-offs between different objectives manifest during policy design and implementation. Key insights are then synthesised into a policy roadmap to help inform integrated action.

These indicators cover health status, non-medical determinants and risk factors, access to and quality of healthcare, health spending and health system resources.

This edition also includes a thematic chapter on gender and health.
