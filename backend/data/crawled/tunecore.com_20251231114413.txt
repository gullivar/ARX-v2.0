SELL YOUR MUSIC What Are Artists Saying About TuneCore? KenTheMan "“TuneCore straight up changed my life. I would write songs in between deliveries and when I started being true to myself, being real, that’s when I blew up. I’m not trying to get any kind of record deal where artists only get a small percentage and they have to give up rights to their own music." AdELA "What I thought was impossible became a reality for me by working with TuneCore. I recommend TuneCore to every artist I meet because I trust them with my creative work and they are helping me achieve my goals and build my legacy."
