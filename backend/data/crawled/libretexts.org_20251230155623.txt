TESTIMONIALS

What Instructors say about us...

I have moved to LibreTexts for all of my classes. It has allowed me to take full advantage of OER so that I was able to customize the textbook by remixing it and also directly embed my videos throughout and embed fully interactive activities allowing students to have mathematics learning materials that address all of their learning styles. My students have repeatedly thanked me for providing them with free materials that provide them the opportunity to succeed in their math classes.

Dr. Larry Green

Professor, Lake Tahoe Community College

I have been using the LibreTexts ADAPT homework system for several years, and it has been an invaluable tool for student learning. The well-designed question banks provide engaging practice opportunities that help students deepen their understanding of course material. ADAPT has become an integral part of my teaching strategy to support student success.

Ying Liu

Professor of Biology, City College San Francisco

The power of LibreTexts and ADAPT has been transformative in my classroom and in OER development. These platforms have not only democratized access to quality educational resources but also fostered a collaborative and innovative spirit among educators. By eliminating the high costs associated with traditional textbooks and homework platforms, LibreTexts has enhanced the learning experience and empowered students to achieve their academic goals without the financial burden traditionally associated with higher education.
In the past 4 years, I have had the pleasure of co-authoring three Spanish OERs through LibreTexts and ADAPT. Through these projects, we are not only creating content for our classes, but also pioneering a new era of accessible and high-quality open resources. Our work exemplifies the potential of OER to revolutionize education by making it more inclusive and equitable. By having my Spanish OER textbooks in LibreTexts and using the free ADAPT homework, my students don’t have to worry about paying for the $200 textbook bundle anymore. LibreTexts has made this possible, and it stands as a testament to what we can achieve when we prioritize accessibility and innovation in education. Together, we are shaping a future where every student has the resources they need to succeed.

Instructor, Chabot College

During the 4 years that I have used it, the growth and development of ADAPT has been remarkable. It is an indispensable part of my pedagogy to enhance student success and learning.

Brian Lindshield

Professor and Associate Department Head, Kansas State University College of Health and Human Sciences

LibreTexts Founder and Executive Director, Delmar Larsen, provided an in-depth, hands-on workshop that covered everything our faculty needed to know to get started using ADAPT for their courses. We learned more about the open homework and assessment platform and how it can help take our campus OER efforts to the next level! We were excited by all the upcoming new features that will enhance the interactivity of OER for students and provide faculty with even more options for creating accessible, engaging content!

Cristina Moon, Ph.D.

Spanish Faculty and OER/ZTC Coordinator

As a full-time OER Librarian, I work with faculty across multiple disciplines, modalities, and platforms to support the adoption, curation, and creation of open educational resources. We recognize that faculty have limited time, and learning new software can be daunting. Most faculty default to Word, Google Docs, or Canvas to build OER, but these tools often result in cumbersome, difficult-to-navigate resources that can take 150–300 hours to develop. Faculty struggle to edit long documents and remix content effectively, and students find the final product less usable.

Switching to LibreTexts transformed our workflow. Tasks that once required over 100 hours now take just one or two. The total time to remix and curate an OER dropped from 300 hours to just 20. LibreTexts streamlined our work breakdown structures, making the entire process more efficient, scalable, and sustainable.

I’ve seen the results firsthand. Faculty love the flexibility, and students love having their materials in multiple formats—whether in print, on their phones, embedded in Canvas, or on the LibreTexts website.

I’m all in. I’ve drunk the Kool-Aid. I’ve seen the power of LibreTexts, and it’s the software I promote the most.

OER Librarian

LibreTexts provides the key that unlocks the door to a world of possibilities for accessing, creating, and sharing educational resources that empower teachers and students to engage in authentic, meaningful learning and teaching opportunities. This inventive, innovative repository of open educational resources can help guide learners to success.

Just as the protagonists in "The Wizard of Oz" discover their own potential abilities and strengths without needing to rely on traditional means, so, too, LibreTexts can serve as a pathway, similar to "The Yellow Brick Road," to the discovery of skills, knowledge, and self-confidence." There's no place like LibreTexts for the exciting world of open education!

Armeda Reitzel

Professor of Communication, California State University, Humboldt

LibreTexts has made my transition to using OER textbooks in all my math courses easy and enjoyable! I love the way I can customize existing OER content so easily into a coherent textbook that covers exactly the right topics and in the way I want them presented. If an explanation or an instruction is unclear, I can improve the wording quickly and easily. If additional examples are needed for a topic, I can easily add them. My students appreciate not having to pay for a textbook, and their performance has not been hindered. In fact, on topics for which I have added my own new explanations and examples, they have performed even better than before!
