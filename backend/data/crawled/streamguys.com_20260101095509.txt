StreamGuys has helped us to a much better job of managing, monetizing and growing our streaming business. Taylor Dick, Vice President of Finance and Strategic Analysis, Dick Broadcasting Company SGrecast’s record capability gives us an aircheck of a game within minutes of the program finishing. It means we can edit and repackage quickly; we can upload a condensed version for reuse, remove outdated commercials, or edit out any mistakes on the live broadcast, and re-upload them wither in the same or in a different space. SGrecast makes it very easy. Dan Rusanowsky, Play-by-Play Announcer, San Jose Sharks StreamGuys built a plan that brings multiple elements at a very affordable price, including my website, archive storage and access, live video streaming bandwidth and administrative aspects. Steve Mathieu, President and Owner, AGP Video StreamGuys has delivered as advertised on their live stream services, but what impresses us most is how fast they onboarded us along with the level of technical support they bring to our localized live streams. They put localized servers in their data centers as we requested, which improved stream redundancies and reduced our operational costs. They have gone above and beyond that from a customer service level, and we are anticipate doing more with them in the near future. Simon Chapman, Digital Director, SEN The StreamGuys team is great to work with. We get to build relationships with the staff there, not just the automatic responses and form letter-like emails you often get from other vendors. StreamGuys is always willing to go that extra mile and works with us on custom solutions to fit our specific needs.
