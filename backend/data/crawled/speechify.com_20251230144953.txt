Speechify is absolutely brilliant. Growing up with dyslexia this would have made a big difference. I’m so glad to have it today.

Sir Richard Branson, Business Magnate

This is the only review I’ve ever written. I downloaded this app to help me read books about the stock market and finance while I do my day job. It brough me to the brink of tears at my desk. Love the app.

LEAHLIZ1989

I absolutely love that this app has been invented. I read a ton of pdf documents as a lawyer and researcher and I will now be able to get through them faster and with much better comprehension than before!

MGOETS9941

If there’s one hill I’m going to die on, it’s that speed listening is the best way forward. Speechify is a game-changer for me.

Mighty be one of the GOAT apps This is probably top 5 of greatest apps ever, you can literally read alone an entire book in a day. Easily worth the cost of the app.

I was skeptical at first, however with my serious issue to be unable to focus reading extensive documentation for work, this program made it a breeze. Well worth the premium dollars! Love it.

TONY HOWARD

Amazing I have ADHD and I love to read but have piles of book that I have never touched. I downloaded this app and it has helped me read more and obtain information better for school! Love this app, I recommend it to everyone!

I am a resident and this app saves me a ton of time. I listen to PDF’s while walking to clinic, running, making coffee in the morning.

Hi, I'm Cliff Weitzman, founder of Speechify.
I am dyslexic.
Growing up, my dad would read Harry Potter to me because I couldn't do it myself. He was my hero.
But without reading, I couldn't become the person I wanted to be.
So, I taught myself to code and built Speechify to read books to me.
Together with over 100 amazing engineers, we've become the largest provider of AI speech in the world.
Today, over 30 million people can achieve their full potential in school and society because Speechify lets them read faster, read more, and remember more.
Thank you for using Speechify!
