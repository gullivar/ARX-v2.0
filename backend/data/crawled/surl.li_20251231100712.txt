An analogue of the abbreviation URL is also the slang word ‘link’ or “reference” in Ukrainian. Together, they form the term surl, which means a short analogue of a long link. This concept formed the basis for the name of the link shortening service Surl.li. From this point of view, sURL is a term designed to give a short name to shortened online addresses, and on the other hand, it is the proper name of the link shortening site where you are located.

Brand your own links, “trim” long links, and create short analogues. A Short Link Will Come in Handy for many reasons A short link is a complete analogue of a long URL. This allows you to transfer addresses of any length, such as links to specific products in an online store, or use additional parameters such as UTM. A short link stores the entire long link along with the parameters and simply redirects the user to the final URL. This completely eliminates a number of problems: - Long links will not be truncated by messengers; - Shortened URLs look equally good in advertising posts and presentations; - You can use shortened addresses to generate simpler QR codes, which store fewer elements and are easier to recognize; - The shortened link is easy to remember because it contains only a few characters. The special value of short links is revealed in printed sources and presentations. Just imagine, all you need to do is print a link consisting of a few characters or generate a QR code from it, and anyone who sees such a link can easily follow it from their smartphone.
