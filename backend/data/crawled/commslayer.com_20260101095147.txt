BEST. VALUE. HELPDESK. We've used most of the bigger CS platforms out there, from Zendesk to Gorgias, and while Commslayer may not have all of the features and integrations, the delta is INSANE. Karri is constantly rolling out new features and changes. Just like how we like to invest in high-delta people, we couldn't be happier with such a crazy high-delta helpdesk. Dr. Evan Zhao Founder, Pacagen IF YOU HAVE NOT SIGNED UP DO SO ASAP. THIS IS NOT A PAID ENDORSEMENT, WE LOVE THE PLATFORM THAT MUCH. Isaac Medeiros Founder, Mini Katana I was evaluating Commslayer vs Gorgias and the value and product offering this has is leaps and bounds better If you're looking for a customer support platform with all the essentials you need, look no further than Commslayer! If I could give this 100 stars I would! Jacob Johnson CEO, Glitch Energy We ditched Gorgias for Commslayer We ditched Gorgias for this as every MF is trying to increase prices and suck blood out of ecom brands. Things are already tough and we dun need to keep switching out of apps cos someone got greedy. Trust me, go with Karri (commslayer) They are serious about their work.

We have since moved on to free merchants and their support teams from their ridiculously priced helpdesks. As a small bootstrapped team we can offer you: Cheap, weirdly good software No seat taxes or surprise fees An AI agent that actually resolves tickets If you are open to betting on the same team who brought Lifetimely to life, Commslayer is ready for you.
