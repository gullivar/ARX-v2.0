Ad formats Native PopUnder Push In-page Native Native At XML Orbit, we specialize in offering Native Ads solutions tailored to your business needs. With our advanced targeting capabilities and diverse inventory, we ensure that your campaigns reach the right audience, delivering optimal results. Whether you’re aiming for brand awareness or direct conversions, our native ad formats are designed to help your business succeed. PopUnder PopUnder Popup Ads: These appear in front of the main browser window when a user visits a website. They are immediately visible and are designed to grab attention quickly. Popunder Ads: These open in a new browser window but remain hidden behind the main browser window. They aim to be less intrusive, as users typically notice them after closing or minimizing the main window. Both types can drive traffic and clicks, but they differ in visibility and user experience. Push Push Push notification ads target audiences through browser notifications on devices, providing a seamless and engaging user experience while adding value to advertising campaigns. These ads are effective in reaching users directly and are equipped with various tracking elements, such as: Image: The primary visual displayed in the notification. Badge: A small icon representing the brand or app. Icon: A secondary visual used to support the content. Pixel: A tracking element to measure performance and engagement. In-page Inpage In-page ads are similar to web push ads but have the advantage of not requiring users to subscribe. These ads seamlessly appear while users are browsing content, ensuring minimal disruption. In-page push ads are an improved version of classic push notifications. They are displayed as interactive widgets that appear on top of website pages or as users scroll down the page. This format provides an engaging and non-intrusive way to capture user attention and drive better interaction with the advertised content.
