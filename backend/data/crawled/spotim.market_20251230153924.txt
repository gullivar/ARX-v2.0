MarketWatch is constantly looking for innovative ways to engage with our readers and help all understand what the news of the day means for you and your money.

GM MarketWatch

We’ve been impressed by results from launching our new commenting system. We saw our comment volume double month over month after launching OpenWeb on our site. The product is slick and easy-to-use, and the results are stunning. It’s also the best tool we’ve seen for content moderation as it helped us squash the horrible spam problem on our site. Highly recommend.

I’ve noticed since I started commenting more frequently, there has been more discussion and a little less judgment. Our moderating platform Spot.IM makes sure all comments are within our editorial policy.
