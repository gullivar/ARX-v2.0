Start Chatting Frequently Asked Questions What is a domain name and why do I need one? A domain name is your website's address, like yourbusiness.com.ng. It's how people find you online and is essential for building your brand.
                                    Whether you're launching a business, blog, or portfolio, registering a domain with a trusted domain provider in Nigeria like WhoGoHost is the first step to establishing your online presence. Can I register a .com.ng domain from Nigeria? Yes! The .com.ng domain is one of the most popular extensions in Nigeria. It's affordable, trusted, and signals that your business is local. You can search, register, and buy your domain quickly on WhoGoHost, one of the top domain and hosting providers in Nigeria. How much does a domain name cost in Nigeria? Domain prices vary depending on the extension. For example, a .com.ng domain starts from N6,450, while a .com domain costs N24,000 per year. WhoGoHost also offers discounts for multiple-year registrations and free renewal when you transfer your domain from another domain provider. How long does it take to activate a domain after purchase? Domains are activated instantly once your payment is confirmed. You get full access to your domain and DNS settings immediately, so you can start building your website or connect it to your hosting with our reliable web hosting services in Nigeria. Can I manage my DNS settings on WhoGoHost? Absolutely. Every domain comes with free DNS management. You can point your domain to your website, email service, or server directly from the control panel—making it easy to manage your domain and hosting in one place. Can I transfer my domain to WhoGoHost? Yes! You can transfer your domain from another domain and hosting provider to WhoGoHost.
                                    When you transfer, you get free renewal for one year, and our support team will guide you through the process. Will I get reminders before my domain expires? Yes. We send multiple email reminders before your domain expires so you have plenty of time to renew.
                                    You can also enable auto-renewal, ensuring your domain and hosting stay active without interruption. What happens if my domain expires? If a domain expires, it will stop working and may eventually become available to others.
                                    We usually provide a grace period to renew, but it’s best to renew on time to avoid losing your domain and any associated web hosting services. Can I use my domain for email? Yes! Once you register your domain, you can create custom email addresses like info@yourdomain.com.ng.
                                    You can also integrate it with Gmail or Google Workspace, making it a full-featured email and domain service for your business. What if the domain I want is already taken? If your preferred domain is taken, try slight variations or different extensions like .com.ng, .org.ng, or .net.ng.
                                    You can also contact WhoGoHost, one of the best domain providers in Nigeria, for suggestions on similar available options. Can I buy multiple domains at once? Yes! WhoGoHost allows you to buy multiple domain names in Nigeria in one purchase.
                                    This is great if you want to secure variations of your brand, protect your business online, or manage several websites from one domain and hosting provider. Why should I choose a local domain provider in Nigeria? Choosing a local domain provider in Nigeria ensures faster support, local pricing, and servers optimized for Nigerian users. \
                                    It also builds trust with your audience by showing your business is local, while giving you easy access to domain management and hosting services. Do I need a domain if I already have social media pages? Yes. Social media pages are helpful, but a domain name gives your brand a professional online presence that you fully control.
                                    It also improves credibility, SEO visibility, and allows you to run a website, email, and other services under your own name.
