What Our Customers Say

Teleport allows us to comply with the regulatory hurdles that come with running an international stock exchange. The use of bastion hosts, integration with our identity service and auditing capabilities give us a compliant way to access our internal infrastructure.

Brendan Germain
Systems Reliability Engineer

Speed is key to our business. But so is security. The Teleport Access Platform allows our engineers to securely access the infrastructure they need to do their jobs without getting in the way of productivity. Everybody wins.

Senior Director of Engineering

The Infrastructure Identity solution from Teleport offers a glimpse into the future of more secure, more resilient, and higher-velocity enterprise computing.

Dr. Ed Amoroso 
CEO & Lead Analyst

We use Teleport Access Requests in combination with Auth0 to easily manage access to our infrastructure. Prior to Teleport, we manually managed SSH keys and a bastion machine and it was an organizational nightmare.

Teleport’s vision for Infrastructure Identity is a game-changer for securing hybrid infrastructure.

Steven Dickens
HyperFRAME

SSO and RBAC support, in combination with Teleport’s unified access control, made secure infrastructure access for humans easy. Machine identity is helping us secure automation. Teleport is simply one of the best privileged access solutions for engineering environments out there.

Olga Daminova
Infrastructure Security Engineer

We used to go through multiple steps just to access cloud resources, and now it happens almost instantly. Our engineers are really happy with the significant improvement in their workflow.

Pradithya Aria Pura
Principal Software Engineer

Over the many years of using Teleport, it's been an essential piece of my infrastructure to help secure access, and centralize my infrastructure into one dashboard, without having to jump around… I'm not sure how I could go without it.
