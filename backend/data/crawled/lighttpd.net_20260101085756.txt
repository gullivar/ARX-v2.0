1.4.82
September 12, 2025
Important changes
restrict request trailers to configured list; bugfixes
BEHAVIOR CHANGES:
trailers in request headers will be ignored unless allowed field names are explicitly configured in a comma-separated list containing no spaces: server.feature-flags += (“request.trailer-whitelist” => “…”) This changes behavior from lighttpd 1.4.80, which added support for request trailers and header merging, but did not restrict request trailers.
