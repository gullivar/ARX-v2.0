Telecom Infra Project (TIP) is a global collaborative community advancing the development and deployment of open, disaggregated, and interoperable telecommunications infrastructure. Through deep collaboration across operators, technology providers, system integrators, startups, and research institutions, TIP turns shared requirements into deployable solutions, reducing complexity, accelerating innovation, and expanding choice across the network stack. ​ TIP’s work spans access, transport, core, and network automation, with a focus on real-world validation through project groups, community labs, testing and certification programs, and ecosystem marketplaces. By aligning technical development with operational reality, TIP helps the industry move faster, from concept to commercial deployment, while building scalable, resilient networks that support the future of global connectivity.
