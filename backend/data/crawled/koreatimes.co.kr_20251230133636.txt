Science minister reaffirms Coupang data leak affected 33 mil. customers

Science Minister Bae Kyung-hoon on Tuesday reaffirmed that a recent data leak at Coupang affected 33 million customers in South Korea, voicing concerns over an assessment report released separately by the U.S.-listed e-commerce giant last week. "The joint government–private sector investigation, including the Personal Information Protection Commission and the police, revealed that the names and email addresses of more than 33 million users were leaked," Bae said during a parliamentary session. The remarks came after Coupang claimed last week that data from only about 3,000 accounts had actually been downloaded and later deleted by the suspect. "We cannot agree with that claim," Bae said. The minister said details such as users' addresses and order information were also believed to have been leaked. "We express grave concern toward Coupang, which issued an announcement that had not been coordinated with the government," he said.

Nuclear safety watchdog approves Saeul-3 reactor operation

South Korea's nuclear watchdog gave an official nod to the operation of the Saeul-3 reactor Tuesday, with its commercial launch set for next year. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission made the decision after holding a meeting on whether to approve the operation of the Saeul-3, a homegrown APR1400 reactor located at the Saeul Nuclear Power Site in the southeastern port city of Ulsan. The move came about two weeks after the commission delayed its final decision in its initial meeting. Following the decision, the unit, whose construction began in 2016, will undergo a pilot run over the next six months. The Saeul-3 marks the first South Korean nuclear reactor designed to withstand aircraft attacks, featuring walls measuring 137 centimeters in thickness, 15 centimeters thicker than those of earlier reactors. The reactor has a spent nuclear fuel storage capacity of up to 60 years, sufficient to store the entire volume generated over its design life. The unit was formerly known as Kori-5 before being renamed in 2022.

Foreign tourists to S. Korea jump 17% in November, close to record 20 mil. for 2025

The number of foreign visitors to South Korea rose sharply in November, climbing 17.3 percent from a year earlier as the country's tourism sector continues to recover to pre-pandemic levels, official data showed Tuesday. According to figures from the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO), about 1.6 million foreign tourists visited in November, up from 1.36 million a year ago and 9.6 percent higher than the same month in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. China remained the largest source of visitors with 378,000 arrivals, followed by Japan at 363,000, Taiwan at 158,000, the United States at 133,000 and the Philippines at 60,000. While the number of Chinese tourists recovered to around 75 percent of 2019 levels, Japanese tourist arrivals surged 40.4 percent compared with the same period that year. From January to November, South Korea welcomed 17.42 million foreign tourists, a 15.4 percent increase from the same period last year and 8.6 percent above 2019 levels, the KTO said. Visitors from China accounted for 29.2 percent, or about 5.09 million, of the total. The Ministry of Culture, Sports a

Gov’t to increase fines for price fixing to $7 mil.

Businesses caught colluding to fix prices and charges will face fines of up to 10 billion won ($6.97 million), more than double the current 4 billion won, under the government’s tightened rules against unfair business practices announced Tuesday. Under the new rules, fines of up to 5 billion won, 10 times the current level, will also be imposed on contractors that abuse their superior bargaining position to interfere in subcontractor operations. The rules were set during a policy meeting between the government and the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, Tuesday, in the second round of plans to reform economic criminal penalties and make them fairer and more effective. The new measures follow a first round held in September, and were designed to address President Lee Jae Myung’s concerns that wealthy and powerful businesses face little pressure from current fines for breaching fair trade practices. During briefings from ministries and other government organizations earlier this month, Lee said these companies should face penalties so severe as to make it feel as if they could go bankrup

Ruling party's floor leader resigns amid allegations of misconduct, abuse of power

The floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), Rep. Kim Byung-kee, resigned from his post Tuesday amid mounting allegations of misconduct, including receiving preferential treatment and abusing his power. Kim announced his resignation during a party meeting at the National Assembly as he apologized over the allegations, such as using free accommodation provided by Korean Air in the past and other misconduct involving his family. "There were acts that fell far short of the public's common sense and point of view, and my shortcomings are entirely responsible. I truly apologize," Kim said. "This (resignation) decision isn't meant to evade responsibility but is my resolve to take greater responsibility after determining right from wrong," he added. Kim said his resignation was also aimed at avoiding putting a burden upon the ruling party and President Lee Jae Myung's administration. Kim had faced pressure to step down after the allegations recently surfaced, which also include instructing aides to help his son with his work and his wife misusing district council funds for per

Gov't probe finds 88 suspicious property deals involving foreigners

The government has uncovered 88 suspected cases of illegal property transactions involving foreign nationals in a special probe on non-housing real estate deals, officials said Tuesday. In the investigation carried out jointly by the land ministry and the Office for Government Policy Coordination from September through last week, the authorities found 126 suspected illegal acts tied to 88 transactions reported between July 2024 and July of this year. The cases mostly involved deals tied to "officetels," or multipurpose buildings with residential and commercial units, and land. Suspected violations include illegal inflows of overseas funds, unauthorized rental operations by foreigners who lack proper residency status and misuse of bank loans. Officials have referred the cases to multiple authorities, including the justice ministry, the Financial Services Commission and the National Tax Service, for follow-up measures. The latest findings follow an earlier probe into housing transactions involving foreigners, during which 210 suspected illegal deals were identified. The land ministry said it

What Korean travelers will love about Doha’s futuristic city design

DOHA, Qatar — Stepping off the plane in Doha, glass towers rise from the desert, air-conditioned walkways cut through the heat and artificial islands stretch into the Persian Gulf — all signs that the capital of Qatar has reinvented itself from its oil-fueled past. Doha is in the midst of a sweeping transformation, balancing its role as a global diplomatic center with ambitions of becoming a modern urban hub. The result is a city that uses its wealth to create a polished, high‑end environment for everyday life as well as for international visitors. The skyline of the West Bay area is the most visible sign of this shift, with its dense collection of glass towers serving as the financial heart of the country. For a visitor from Korea, this development could be a major point of interest because the city is not only expanding in size but also creating specialized districts for different needs. These projects are part of the country's strategy to diversify the economy beyond energy resources under the Qatar National Vision 2030. Much of this rapid progress was accelerated by the 2022 F

Silver spoons at sea: Why Korea’s chaebol heirs choose the Navy

Headlines about SK Group outside the business pages in recent years have usually been about Chairman Chey Tae-won’s highly publicized and contentious divorce from his wife, Roh So-yeong, director of Art Center Nabi and the daughter of late President Roh Tae-woo. Just as the Korean public grew weary of the high-profile couple’s prolonged legal battles, fresh news about the conglomerate centered on the couple’s second daughter, Chey Min-jung. Chey drew significant media attention for an unexpected decision: She joined the Navy as an officer. In South Korea, military service is mandatory for all able-bodied men, but not for women. Her voluntary enlistment became the talk of the town, drawing sustained public interest until her discharge in 2017. This year, another scion of a family-run conglomerate, or chaebol, captured the spotlight for a similar choice. Lee Jee-ho, the son of Samsung Electronics Executive Chairman Lee Jae-yong, made headlines on Nov. 28 during a commissioning ceremony at the Naval Academy in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province.

‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ scores global box-office success in 4DX and ScreenX

Sci-fi tentpole “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is proving its box-office power in global markets, posting standout results across premium formats including ScreenX, 4DX and Ultra 4DX. CJ CGV announced Tuesday that the blockbuster film posted the highest opening-weekend sales among this year’s releases worldwide in ScreenX, 4DX and Ultra 4DX theaters. The ticket sales for 4DX theaters in the opening weekend alone was nearly double the average of any films released this year, while Ultra 4DX, which combines features of ScreenX and 4DX, reached about 2.5 times the average, underscoring audiences’ strong demand for premium cinema. "'Avatar: Fire and Ash' has clearly demonstrated the value of premium-format viewing experiences not only in Korea but around the world," CJ 4DPLEX CEO Bang Jun-sik said. "We’ll continue strengthening our globally competitive special-format theaters going forward." The film's performance in North America has also been notable. During its opening week, the share of ticket sales for ScreenX and 4DX was more than 1.5 times higher than the average share of this year

Budget minister nominee apologizes for her remarks supporting Yoon's martial law

The nominee for budget minister offered an apology Tuesday for her previous remarks in support of former President Yoon Suk Yeol's failed martial law bid. "An insurrection is clearly a wrongdoing that should never occur in our constitutional history," Lee Hye-hoon said, acknowledging that she had failed to grasp the essence of the matter at the time. She made the remarks while heading to her office to prepare for her parliamentary confirmation hearing. Lee is a former three-term lawmaker from the conservative camp, and her nomination by President Lee Jae Myung has prompted criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with the ruling party expressing grievances over her past remarks supporting the failed martial law and the conservative opposition block calling her a traitor. Her apology came after President Lee said she needs to clarify her past comments regarding Yoon's martial law attempt. Lee was tapped Sunday to head the new Ministry of Planning and Budget, which will be established under the prime minister's office as part of a government reorganization bill set to take effec

Odd man out: Kim Byung-kee’s fall in the DPK

Rep. Kim Byung-kee, floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), has become odd man out. He is facing calls to step down not only from the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) but also from within his own party. Kim faces multiple allegations. He is accused of having been treated to meals worth 700,000 won ($485) by the former CEO of Coupang. He also allegedly accepted prepaid travel vouchers worth 1.6 million won ($1,107) from Korean Air, which he used with his family to stay in a five-star hotel on Jeju Island. In another allegation, Kim is said to have instructed a legislative staffer to contact Hanwha Group to confirm whether Indonesia’s president-elect was planning to visit the company. He then allegedly relayed the information to his son, a case officer at the National Intelligence Service (NIS), so that it could be reported to his son’s superior. The PPP demanded Kim’s immediate resignation. “He created the problem, so he must take responsibility,” PPP spokesperson Rep. Park Sung-hoon said on Saturday. Park added that the allegations are serious enoug

From exchange students to corporate insiders, Smagin twins present new vision of 'Korean Dream'

When Evgenii and Oleg Smagin arrived in Korea as exchange students more than a decade ago, they were struck by the country’s intensity. Everything felt fast and ambitious — a place where effort is visibly translated into progress. For the identical twins from Russia who share a passion for cutting-edge technology, Korea offered both excitement and possibility. That first impression, however, would later deepen into something more demanding — and more transformative. Today, the Smagin twins are the authors of "The Korean Dream," a book gaining attention among both foreign residents and Korean readers. Part memoir and part practical guide, the book traces their shared journey from international students to MBA graduates of KAIST, and eventually to professionals working at major Korean corporations such as SK Telecom and JB Financial Group. More than a success story, it offers a rare insider-outsider perspective on what it actually takes for foreigners to build long-term lives in Korea. “Our story really became the foundation of the book,” the brothers said in a joint interview.

Slow-aging guru’s wellness empire unravels amid authorship issues, sexual abuse dispute

Once hailed as the doctor who taught Koreans how to grow old slowly, Jung Hee-won is watching his "slow aging" brand fall apart. Allegations of stalking, sexual coercion and claims that he took credit for a former employee’s work have triggered corporate boycotts, the loss of prestigious public roles and a broader reckoning over power, gender and credibility in Korea’s latest wellness industry. From slow-aging guru to policy insider Jung, 41, rose to fame as a geriatrician at Seoul Asan Medical Center, turning complex data on frailty and chronic disease into a simple promise: slow aging. A graduate of Seoul National University College of Medicine, he built his authority treating and studying older patients as Korea grappled with rapid population aging and a growing national focus on healthy longevity. He packaged this philosophy as "slow aging," framing it as the opposite of "accelerated aging," and turned it into social media content and bestselling books offering practical routines on diet, exercise and daily routines for people in their 30s to 50s.

'Spring Fever' director sets sights on topping hit drama 'Marry My Husband'

Director Park Won-guk on Monday expressed his hope that the upcoming romance series "Spring Fever" will surpass the popularity of his record-setting previous work "Marry My Husband." "I can't be satisfied with ordinary love anymore," the director joked at a press conference in Seoul. "While preparing 'Spring Fever,' I set my goal to receive even greater love than 'Marry My Husband.'" His earlier series for tvN, which aired from Jan. 2-Feb. 20 of last year, achieved a peak viewership of 12 percent, the highest for the cable channel's Monday-Tuesday drama slot. Its popularity also led to a Japanese remake earlier this year. Based on a web novel of the same name, the upcoming romance revolves around the budding relationship between Yoon Bom (Lee Ju-bin), a cool-headed teacher, and Seon Jae-gyu (Ahn Bo-hyun), a passionate man whose nephew attends the school where Bom teaches. Ahn portrays Jae-gyu, whose imposing physique and rough, tattoo-covered exterior hide a surprising charm and steadfast love. His world begins to sway as he falls for Bom.

Hyun Bin, Son Ye-jin donate $139,000 to Samsung Medical Center

Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin, both actors, donated 200 million won ($139,000) to a Seoul hospital to support patients in need, Hyun Bin's agency said Tuesday. The donation to Samsung Medical Center will be used to help patients facing financial difficulties, according to VAST Entertainment. The couple expressed hope that the donation "would be helpful, even in the slightest bit, to patients and their families." This marks the couple's latest charitable contribution. They previously donated 150 million won each to Seoul Asan Medical Center and Samsung Medical Center, respectively, to support pediatric patients' treatment. In November, Hyun Bin won the best actor award at the 46th Blue Dragon Awards for his portrayal of independence fighter Ahn Jung-geun (1879-1910) in the period drama "Harbin." His wife, Son, was named Best Actress at the same ceremony for her role in Park Chan-wook's "No Other Choice."

VIDEO Even potluck parties turn competitive in Korea

A potluck party held in Hongdae to celebrate YouTube channel Howdy Korea reaching 100,000 subscribers turned out to be much more than a simple gathering. Former guests and crew reunited for the event, creating a festive atmosphere where food, fashion and enthusiasm came together in a friendly showdown. The guest list included a face reader with 35 years of experience, a Korean shaman known as the “Snowflake Witch” and former Howdy Korea host Kady. Each arrived with dishes they had personally prepared: a seafood hangover soup loaded with abalone, shrimp, crab, mussels and clams; steaming braised short ribs; and even North Korean-style coriander kimchi made by host Joel himself. The table quickly became a vibrant display of Korean cuisine. But the excitement extended far beyond the food. With votes held for “Best Foodie” and “Best Dresser,” the evening evolved into a playful competition. The shaman, dressed in a white outfit, claimed the Best Dresser title. Meanwhile, the face reader, whose seafood stew captivated attendees, was named Best Foodie. She boosted the excitement f
