Georgetown Campuses

Georgetown University was founded on a hilltop in the village of Georgetown during the late 1700s. Centuries later, the village is a neighborhood of DC, and the university has expanded from the Hilltop to campuses downtown and beyond.

Visit Our Campuses
Hilltop Campus
Capitol Campus

With its historic buildings and green quads, the Hilltop Campus is among the nation’s most beautiful. Here, tradition and serenity meet the rhythms of a tight community that’s motivated to act in the world, making the Hilltop both a sanctuary and a lively launchpad.

Life on the Hilltop
DC at Your Doorstep

Washington is the epicenter of global politics. It’s also a dynamic city for everything from arts to community-based work. Whether you intern on the Hill, consult pro-bono for an NGO or take time out for an embassy party, it’s your DC.
