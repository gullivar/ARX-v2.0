Be Part of a Decentralized and Permissionless Agent Network fueling AI with Real-Time Data

Join now and get your share
Let’s Transform
the Open Web Together.

At Teneo Protocol, we believe data should be open, accessible, and fairly distributed. Right now, real-time data and digital trends are locked behind expensive APIs or platform restrictions – while people generating this data get nothing in return. 

Worse, they’re left without the means to build on it, learn from it, or benefit from it at all.

We’re changing that – by building a decentralized, community-powered AI Agent network where you’re in control, your contributions fuel the future of AI and you earn your fair share of the value created.

What is the Teneo Protocol Community Node?

The Teneo Protocol Community Node is an AI agent that anyone can run directly in their browser. The agent collects and structures real-time data from across the web. Operating in a fully permissionless system, the agent responds directly to your defined tasks, not centralized control.

Why run a Community Node?

By running a Community Node, you're doing more than just contributing to data accessibility. You're taking part in a movement that shifts power back to the users, making real-time data a shared asset.

You’ll earn rewards based on how active and consistent your node is, whether through keeping it online, referring others, or reaching connectivity milestones. Your node isn't just a tool; it's a way to directly benefit from the decentralized data economy we're building at Teneo.

What are Points?


Points are the rewards you earn for running a Teneo Protocol Community Node. The more you contribute, the more you earn – so get involved and watch your rewards grow!


How can I earn Points?


You can earn Points by connecting your Node, inviting new users to the network, achieving connectivity streaks, and linking your social media accounts. Please note that the points model may evolve over time.
