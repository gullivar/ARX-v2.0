INSIDE AVIA'S GAMES
Here's everything you need to know about Avia's skill-based real-money games!
Are Avia's real-money skill-based games legal?

Yes, Avia’s skill-based real-money games are legal in the jurisdictions where they are offered. Unlike traditional gambling, which relies purely on chance or luck, our games are designed to assess and reward players' skills. At Avia, we prioritize legal compliance and adhere to applicable laws and regulations. We are committed to providing a safe, fair, and legitimate gaming experience, and we take pride in being a responsible and trustworthy developer and operator. If you have any questions or concerns about the legality of our real-money games, please don’t hesitate to contact our customer service team by filling out the Contact Us Form provided at the bottom. We're here to help!

How can I be sure that matches are fair?

At Avia, we are committed to maintaining a trustworthy and fair platform for all our players. To achieve this, we have developed a sophisticated algorithm that assesses players' skill levels and sets up matches accordingly. Players will be matched when entering the same game mode with the same entry fee. This ensures that competitions are fair and that each player has an equal opportunity to win based on their skills. We take questions of fairness and any accusations of cheating very seriously. If you have any concerns about the fairness of a game, please scroll down to contact our customer service team by filling out the Contact Us Form.

Am I competing against real, live players?

Our algorithms strive to match you with real, live players from around the globe who have similar skill levels. However, if our matching algorithm is unable to find an opponent of your approximate skill level among the currently logged-in players, we may match you with a recorded game from a real player with a similar skill level (referred to as a "Historical Playthrough"). In these cases, we generate the profile information displayed and do not use the user profile of the player whose record was used.

Our algorithms ensure that all players in the same match experience the same game setup parameters. Therefore, once you start a match, whether against a currently logged-in player or a recorded game from a real player, you will play under identical conditions as every other player in that match.

For example, in Solitaire Clash, once a match begins, you and your opponent—regardless of whether it's a live player or a Historical Playthrough—will face the same initial hand, with all cards (including covered cards) placed in the same order. You will both have the same playing time and follow the same game rules, including point addition and subtraction.

If you achieve a score that surpasses that of the other player(s) in the game and are otherwise eligible for a prize, you will win it, regardless of whether you compete against live players or Historical Playthroughs. If the scores of any Historical Playthroughs are the winners of that game, Avia will retain the prizes won by those scores.

How can I be sure my opponent isn't cheating?

At Avia, we take cheating and fraud very seriously, and we have implemented several measures to prevent such activities on our platform. If you suspect that your opponent has cheated during a match, we encourage you to report the Match ID to our Player Support team for a prompt investigation. We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating, and any player found to be cheating will be banned from Avia apps.

We understand that cheating can be frustrating and can detract from the gaming experience. Rest assured, we are committed to providing a fair and enjoyable gaming environment for all players and ensuring our platform is free from unfair or fraudulent activities. If you have any concerns or questions regarding cheating or other forms of misconduct, please contact our customer service in the app or fill out the Contact Us Form below.
