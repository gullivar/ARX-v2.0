                                    50 things that are "so FIT." FIT VOICES I decided to go to FIT for college, and a big selling point of it for me was that
                                 it was in New York City. I viewed NYC as this big, creative social hub where you'll
                                 meet other artists your age or older. I also liked that FIT was a state school, and
                                 it wouldn't financially devastate me if I went there. I was able to take bigger risks
                                 with the kind of art I wanted to make after graduating. -- Alex Krokus, from a tcj.com
