The average price our registered service agencies and business formation merchants are paying is 2%. Yes, that's the OVERALL effective rate, after everything. Agentprocessing.com was created specifically for your niche. We understand you. We found many sponsoring banks and acquirers didn't understand your industry, thus overcharging you, and worse, refusing to process electronic transmissions for you. We struggled finding a cost effective solution for you, so we worked with our sponsoring bank to get them to understand your risk and offer you an amazing price. We beat everyone-period. What is Cost + pricing? A bank issuing a credit card to you charges for this. If you use a local bank, they probably don't have a lot of assets, so Visa and MasterCard charge more to process their credit cards. If you use a big bank like Wells Fargo, Visa and MasterCard charge less to process their credit cards. If someone has a rewards card where they make 1% back on purchases, you pay for that when you accept that card-NOT the bank giving that person a credit card to use. YOU the merchant pay for that. Cost + Pricing Cont. So if your clients use a debit card from a big bank like Wells Fargo, between what Wells Fargo and Visa charge, you'll have a cost of somewhere around 1.65% + .15 cents. So when we say we'll charge you cost + 10 basis points, that means you'll pay 1.75%  or .0175 The average registered agent sale ticket is $100. In this scenario, you'd be paying $2.00 total, to collect $100. Thus, your overall effective rate would be 2%. There are cheaper debit cards that get below 1% and there are really expensive cards like a Lowes credit card or a USAA credit card or basically any card that gives that user a reward, you, the business accepting the credit card, is paying that reward fee. We beat ANY credit card processing deal you can find. We're at least 1-2% cheaper than any bid we've ever seen. But if you want to save even more money, we have a proprietary systems in place to deny your clients from using expensive cards like rewards cards, and prompt them to use debit cards. We have a budget, low-cost-oriented registered agent service in Nevada utilizing this approach and they are averaging 1.5% total effective rate, which is unheard of in the online eprocessing world.
