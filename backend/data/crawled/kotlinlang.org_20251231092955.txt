Kotlin Multiplatform AWS opted for Kotlin over Java for Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) thanks to its expressiveness and structured concurrency. They rewrote QLDB in Kotlin, enhancing the user experience, benefiting from its development workflow, and adopting it fully for server-side development. Server-side Philips utilizes Kotlin Multiplatform in its HealthSuite digital platform mobile SDK. With KMP, they accelerated the implementation of new features and fostered increased collaboration between Android and iOS developers. Kotlin Multiplatform Adobe Experience Platform chose Kotlin for server-side development because of its concise syntax, async capabilities, and interoperability with Java. This shift boosted productivity and improved the developer experience, replacing Java for real-time services. Server-side By sharing over 80% of logic across iOS and Android, Forbes now rolls out new features simultaneously on both platforms, keeping the flexibility to withhold or customize features based on the specific platform. Kotlin Multiplatform Atlassian adopted Kotlin for the Jira Software cloud, leveraging its Java compatibility for seamless integration and minimizing migration challenges. Kotlin's ease of use improved developer productivity and boosted team satisfaction and efficiency. Server-side See all case studies Share code on your terms and for different platforms Simplify the development of cross-platform projects with Kotlin Multiplatform. It reduces time spent writing and maintaining the same code for different platforms while retaining the flexibility and benefits of native programming. Kotlin applications will work on different operating systems, such as iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, watchOS, and others.
