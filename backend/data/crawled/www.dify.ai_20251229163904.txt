Just tried out @dify_ai for the first time and I'm blown away. This is one of the most polished LLM-centric application I have used so far! Also includes support for local models through @ollama and any OpenAI-like API.

Wait, with @dify_ai you can build an no-code workflow to generate an AI podcast like notebooklm. Mindblowing.

If you are building AI applications it might be worth checking out the workflow feature by @dify_ai. It allows developers to build complex LLM flows using a simple drag-and-drop interface. And the whole thing is open source too. Link to repo: https://github.com/langgenius/dify

Perfect for generating multiple format marketing copy: AI Workflow tools for running 2 ChatGPT prompt in same time! 

Built my first AI demo using @Dify_AI workflows - it runs multiple prompts simultaneously and processes them in sequence.
