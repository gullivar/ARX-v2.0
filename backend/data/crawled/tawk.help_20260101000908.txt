Have questions? Let's do our best to answer your most frequently asked questions How many agents can we add? There are no limits to the number of agents you can add to a property. tawk.to is an agent-centric chat application, which means every agent has their own account and you can share properties. How can you offer this for free? We generate revenue by providing Hired Agent services for customers that don’t want to answer the chat themselves. To use the software and answer yourself is completely free, with no limits at all on the number of Agents, chat volumes or sites you can add widgets to. tawk.to is truly 100% free and then just $1/hr if you need professionally trained, native speaking chat agents to help you answer your chats. Win/Win right? Do you limit the number of concurrent chats? No. You can answer as many concurrent chats as you wish. There are no limits. Is our data safe? We take your privacy and data security very seriously. All communication between you and your visitors is over SHA-256 Secure Socket Layer, and all data is housed on encrypted servers. Will I ever be charged to use the software? No. The Desktop and Mobile apps are all 100% free. We have no intention to charge you for using the software. It completely goes against our business model. A small number of our users pay a very small fee to remove the “Powered by tawk.to” branding, though you are NOT obliged to do so. We do not limit features. Offering a premium product completely free is what has made tawk.to the #1 most widely used chat application in the world. Are there any Ads? No! We do not have any annoying Ads within tawk.to! Yuck! Under no circumstance would we ever sell your data, or promote 3rd party products to you. You are not the product. How do I get support? We offer 24×7-365 live support via both chat and email. Simply initiate a chat on our site at any time, and a member of our dedicated support team will help as best as they can. Where can I find documentation? The tawk.to Help Center can be found here . Do you offer a self-hosted solution? tawk.to is a hosted solution. We don’t currently offer an on-premise option. However, we would like to shed some light on this issue, as it’s important to understand why that is the case. tawk.to is currently hosted at Google Cloud, with a globally distributed architecture, to bring the application as close as possible to both our customers and end consumers. Due to the nature of Messaging, the speed (and latency) of message delivery can be the difference between a great or poor visitor experience. For a product like Live Chat, on-premise hosting is honestly a really bad idea. How many businesses use tawk.to? tawk.to is the world’s #1 most widely used live chat software. More than 35% of all websites that use live chat, use tawk.to. Millions of business users communicate with billions of end consumers via tawk.to. In fact, over 2 billion end consumers interact with a tawk.to widget each and every month. That’s 1/5th of the world’s population. When is your next Meetup? Something we are most proud of at tawk.to is the number of incredible relationships we have made within our community. Which is why we‘ve continued to invest in global-meetups since inception. From Bali to Berlin and Melbourne to Milan, we regularly meet with our community. We’ve learned so much from the time we’ve spent together. Given the current restrictions impacting global travel, we have suspended Meetups. To register your interest and see where the tawk.to crew will be next, please bookmark meet.tawk.to . We can’t wait to meet you all out there soon! Where are you based? We trade from Las Vegas, Nevada, though tawk.to has a globally distributed team. We hire the best people we can find, regardless of location. We are a diverse crew. And when we say diverse, we really mean it. Our CEO/founder is an Italian-Australian, our CTO is an Indian-Malaysian, our COO is a Russian-Latvian and we are made up of hundreds of dedicated crew members spread across 20 different countries and all time zones. Just between our founders alone, we speak 7 languages. The rest of the crew speak 20+. We believe you are not defined by where you were born, the religion you follow, the shade of your complexion, or the language you speak. Diversity and inclusion are at the core of who we are. We hire based on merit and firmly believe that good people attract good people. “You shouldn't have to pay to chat with the visitors on your website. They're your visitors!” Forever Free. It's that simple. Robert, founder. People prefer to message Your customers have spoken loud and clear.
