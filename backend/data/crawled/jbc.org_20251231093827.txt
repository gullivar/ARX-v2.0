About
Journal of Biological Chemistry

The Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) welcomes high-quality science that seeks to elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of biological processes. Papers published in JBC can therefore fall under the umbrellas of not only biological chemistry, chemical biology, or biochemistry, but also allied disciplines such as biophysics, systems biology, RNA biology, immunology, microbiology, neurobiology, epigenetics, computational biology, 'omics, and many more.

Companion Journals
The Journal of Lipid Research (JLR) focuses on the science of lipids in health and disease. The journal emphasizes lipid function and the biochemical and genetic regulation of lipid metabolism and aims to be on the forefront of the emerging areas of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics as they relate to lipid metabolism and function.
