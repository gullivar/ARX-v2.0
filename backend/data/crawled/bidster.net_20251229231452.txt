We are SSP. We buy
and sell traffic.

VAST, RTB, POPS, Programmatic — that's all about us.
Message us — we'll help, advise, launch. We'll set up traffic, figure out questions, respond in Telegram even at night.

Okay, let's be friends, drop us a message on Telegram
(
WHO WE ARE
)

We are a team backed by a strong technological foundation. Under the hood, we have our own data center with triple redundancy, Kubernetes, and a whole team of DevOps engineers on duty 24/7.

We monitor stability, track incidents in real-time, and strengthen our infrastructure every day so everything just works for you — fast, reliable, and without timeouts.

«We work fast. We think together.
We smile more than we should.»

We don't like not working, we like when it works.

We don't have a 'customer service department' — we have real people who solve problems.

We get excited about good traffic, clean reports, and when everyone succeeds.

Our style is constructiveness, humor, support, and engagement.

WHAT WE DO
)
BEFORE LAUNCH, WE CAREFULLY ORGANIZE EVERYTHING

We manually compile white/black domain lists so your traffic comes only from the right sources.

Hi! Connected the test campaign, seems to be working. What's next?

Hi there! Great 🙌
Before launch, let's go through the traffic.
Please send us the site categories you need — we'll manually check domains and filter out everything unnecessary.

Here, exported. Everything mixed up, to be honest 😅

Okay, no problem! We'll compile white and black lists so only live traffic from normal sources comes to you.
We'll give final approval before launch ✌️ By the way, keeping anime? 😅

WE PASS ANY VERIFIER CHECKS

No discrepancies — all metrics are within normal limits, crystal clear.

Guys, hi! Measured your traffic, metrics are good, quality is excellent. Let's work!)

Hi, great) We try to send only the traffic you need.

Maybe in that case we can increase volumes?

Yes, let's do it, I'll add more demand now

MESSAGES
Live and friendly response

You write on weekends, holidays or at night, we engage

Hey guys! My script isn't loading on the player for some reason... Can we take a look?

Oh, hi! Already looking 👀
I see a timeout on the domain — we'll fix it now.

Done, refresh the page — should be fine.
Thanks for writing right away 💛

Wow, you actually responded 😅 Thanks for helping even on holidays!

Keep our finger on the pulse

We monitor, adjust, warn

Hi! Something's wrong with requests today, they dropped a bit. Is this normal?

Hi! We see — traffic decreased for RU geo, seems like some problem on the publisher side.
We'll double-check across platforms now.

Okay, let us know. Maybe we can adjust something.

Got it! Reconfigured one source and will add a couple of fresh ones — should stabilize.
Watching live, won't let go 😌

We comply with KPI

No "well you understand"

Guys, according to the contract we have CTR from 1.2% — but now it's holding at 0.9%.
Something wrong?

Hi! Yes, we see. This is related to performance drop from one of the major publishers.
We'll turn off the declining source and add new ones.
Plus we'll optimize by domains and create a BL.

Ok, thanks for explaining. We'll stay in touch.

Updated settings, first numbers will come in 10–15 min. Let us know if everything's ok?.

I see everything. Thanks! As always, spot on 🙌
