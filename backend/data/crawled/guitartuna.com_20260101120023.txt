Easy to use, super user-friendly, and they have a bunch of fun different chords and songs to help you learn new music. I highly recommend. ” Well-Designed App Rose the Black Cat “ I mostly use this for tuning my guitar, which this app makes ridiculously easy. It also has a large selection of songs to play along to and it helps show you which chords to play as well how to make the shapes with your fingers. ” Got me back into playing Tuliketsune “ I got this app to tune an old guitar, and noticed it has a feature that autoscrolls as I play chords to famous songs.
