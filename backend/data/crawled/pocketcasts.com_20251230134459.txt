It keeps getting better.

“Although Android finally has its own podcasts app, you may want to check out a very good third-party option: Pocket Casts, which as of this year is owned by NPR and three other public radio producers. And it’s only gotten better since, with a big redesign arriving just last month that delivers some much-requested features.”

The complete package

“The interface is beautiful and clean and intuitive, and the discover page has featured shows, curated lists, and top charts to help you find new podcasts… It really is the complete package.”

“It’s smart listening, made simple”
