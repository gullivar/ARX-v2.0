It’s cheaper and and has a better stats design.

Also, their team is very nice and helped me to improve open and bounce rates. 3:12 PM – 10 Oct 2024 Tom Ravn @TomR4vn I am testing Mailtrap last weeks. You can send emails from your domain for free. They allow 1000 mails/month. It is quite ok. It can be used with good old SMTP connection or via API.

@Mailtrap 3:44 PM – 16 May 2023 Joshua Anderton @joshuaanderton Just signed up for @Mailtrap  and I’m loving it. So easy to set up. Provides so much peace of mind. Ahh just love it. 7:38 PM – 13 Jan 2021 DeveloperMitch @mitchellfinlay After all these years of web development, how have I only  JUST started using @Mailtrap. I had heard about it, but never got round to using it. An awesome way of testing emails 👏 1:25 PM – 7 Nov 2020 Alessandro Rodi @coorasse I love @Mailtrap. It removes all the asshole of configuring email servers in test environments. Great service! Is totally worth your money! 1:15 PM – 20 Oct 2020 Mr. Glass @MisterGlass Shout out to @Mailtrap, hands down the best way to handle mail sending in local/test environments. 11:43 PM – 21 May 2020 Rado Georgiev @Rado_g One thing we started using recently is @Mailtrap for our dev & staging environments. We were previously either turning email sending entirely off for staging or running SES + whitelist. Turns out, having a fake SMTP mailbox is great and you can test better with it. 1:32 PM – 6 Jan 2021 Doug Black Jr @dougblackjr Can we all agree @Mailtrap  is a gift to developers everywhere?
