The Internet exchanges (INXs) provide the only data-centre agnostic facility for operators to connect and exchange traffic (peer) in South Africa.  Peering encourages the routing of domestic Internet traffic by providing an optimal path for traffic to reach other networks within the same city, country or continent. Connecting to any of the INXs is easy, and open to any network that has its own IP address space and an autonomous system number. INX-ZA is an autonomous division of the Internet Service Providers’ Association ( ISPA ) of South Africa. front-page peering Overview Content Tools Powered by Atlassian Confluence 7.13.20 Printed by Atlassian Confluence 7.13.20 Report a bug Atlassian News Atlassian {"serverDuration": 84, "requestCorrelationId": "299c817654145aae"}
