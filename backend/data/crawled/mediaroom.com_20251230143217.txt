Empower your team and own your narrative with a powerful, scalable online newsroom

When you release a new story, you want everyone to see the headline, read the details and get more info. Making sure your latest press release is immediately available on your website sounds simple. Yet for many organizations, the timing can be challenging. The process to get something posted on a corporate website often involves website operations, review cycles and time that communications teams just don't have.

When you publish your organization's news over the wire, you want the release to be immediately, or even automatically, available on your website. PR Newswire media room hosting and design services enable you to distribute your news and publish to your newsroom simultaneously in the same workflow.

  There are two things that I really appreciate about our websites: the integration of technology, like the fact that our existing media monitoring and our PR Newswire content communicate with the new website, and the ease of use. It has not been another full-time job to manage this website. I'm grateful for that."

Ashley Leopoulos, Public Relations Manager, Simmons Bank

You can provide journalists and other media contacts, influencers, bloggers, investors, customers and all of your audiences fast access to announcements, media coverage, images, videos and more, all in one place.

Start using the core essentials for your newsroom or benefit from a custom branded, fully-hosted, state-of-the-art online MediaRoom backed by PR Newswire experience and expertise. Our turnkey solution includes design services, advanced site features and dedicated 24/7 support for a fraction of the typical cost.

"We've always had a news release page on our external site that was managed by PR Newswire. Anytime TD would have a news release, PR Newswire would automatically post that news release on our website. It saves us time and has been so helpful to have it so timely.”
