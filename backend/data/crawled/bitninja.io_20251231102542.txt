The drop was so dramatic that we decided to provide BitNinja for free to our web hosting customers. ” FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS How does BitNinja WAF Pro protect web applications? BitNinja WAF Pro protects web applications by filtering malicious requests in real time using machine-learned rules, global threat intelligence and automatic cloud updates. Unlike traditional module-based WAFs, it runs as a standalone, high-performance engine that doesn’t depend on Apache, NGINX or LiteSpeed, so it avoids compatibility issues and server slowdowns. The result: stronger protection, lower resource usage, and effortless deployment across any hosting environment. What makes BitNinja the best malware scanner? BitNinja combines AI-driven malware detection with global cloud intelligence to identify and remove threats before they can impact your servers. Its lightweight agent scans efficiently in real time, detects zero-day and polymorphic malware, and delivers enterprise-level protection without consuming extra system resources or slowing down your websites. Why hosting providers trust BitNinja? Hosting providers trust BitNinja because it combines powerful, AI-driven server protection with exceptional support. Its lightweight, cloud-based agent automatically blocks malware, malicious bots, and suspicious IPs, keeping servers stable and secure with minimal effort. BitNinja’s support team goes beyond ticket handling, helping partners solve unique issues quickly and effectively. How does BitNinja’s IP reputation system stop attacks before they reach your server? BitNinja’s IP reputation system blocks attacks proactively by sharing real-time threat data across thousands of protected servers. When an IP shows malicious behavior anywhere in the network, it is instantly greylisted and denied access everywhere else. Unlike static blocklists or manual firewall rules, BitNinja updates automatically and stops bots, scanners, brute-force attempts and other attacks before they ever reach your server. Why is BitNinja easier to manage than other security solutions? BitNinja is easier to manage because it unifies multiple security layers into a single lightweight agent. It automates malware detection, IP reputation, and firewall protection through cloud intelligence, reducing manual configuration and false positives.
