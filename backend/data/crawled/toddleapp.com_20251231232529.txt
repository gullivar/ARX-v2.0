We've always had clear intended learning goals, but with Toddle, those goals are now directly linked to lesson plans, evidence collection and evaluation. This integration has made us more accountable, ensuring that we truly deliver on our intended curriculum. Teresa Belisle International School of Prague, The Czech Republic All-in-one As a school that doesn't rely on a single textbook, it can be hard for families to see what students are learning. Toddle's messaging and evidencing tools have changed that by bringing everything together in one place. Now, learning is more visible to families, giving them a greater sense of security about their child’s growth. Shaun Porter Dalton School, Hong Kong Communications Hub, Student Portfolios “As teachers, our goal is always to personalize learning for each student, but that often requires hours of manually coordinating data across platforms. Toddle has transformed this process by centralising all student information in one place and making it readily accessible. ” Esra Osman MADAC Schools, Saudi Arabia All-in-one “I’ve tried several platforms, but nothing compares to Toddle. Every feature on the platform reflects the team’s teaching roots and their deep, nuanced understanding of what teachers need.
