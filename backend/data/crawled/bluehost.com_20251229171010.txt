Blue Host has the absolute best…

Blue Host has the absolute best customer service! I've been administering domains for more than 20 years, used many hosting services, so this accolade is coming from someone who knows the good, bad and ugly of dealing with hosting customer and tech services!

30+ Years Don't Lie! Bluehost rocks...

I've been using Bluehost for most of the 30+ years my websites have needed a home! They are quick to respond and always fix any issues immediately, including filling in the technical knowledge I don't have! Excellent service, which is more than I can say about other website hosting businesses I've tried over the years. For example, I set up my own emails and aliases instead of paying big bucks elsewhere!

The performance is good and the…

The performance is good and the technical support via chat is fast and solves the problem from the first contact most of the time, but there are things that we want the wonderful company to update. I always tell the technical support about them, including adding the Western language to the hosting control panel and technical support. Other than that, Bluehost is a wonderful and truly pioneering company.

FAQs
WHAT IS WEB HOSTING?

Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and businesses to make their websites accessible on the internet. Web hosting companies provide servers and infrastructure to store and serve website files to visitors. Without web hosting, websites would not be visible online. Bluehost is one of the leading web hosting providers in the world, and is trusted by bloggers, small businesses, WordPress users, eCommerce and online store owners, and more.

WHAT TYPES OF WEB HOSTING OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?

There are four main types of web hosting: Dedicated Hosting, Web Hosting, Cloud Hosting and VPS Hosting. Dedicated hosting provides a server solely for one user; web hosting allows multiple users to share one server; cloud hosting is powered by a redundant global server infrastructure to handle high traffic; VPS hosting is a hybrid of web hosting and dedicated hosting. Each web hosting option has its own benefits and drawbacks, and the choice depends on the specific needs of the website.

HOW CAN I GET A FREE DOMAIN NAME?

Bluehost is proud to offer a free domain name with many hosting plans. This can be a great way to save money and simplify the process of setting up a website. Be sure to check the details of the hosting plan to see if a free domain name is included, and view our full policy on free domains.

WHAT IS THE 30-DAY MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE?

Your satisfaction is our top priority and we're confident you'll be pleased with our services. Still, if you try us and decide your account does not sufficiently meet your needs, you can cancel within 30 days for a refund as follows: 

If you cancel within 30 days you'll receive a full refund on your hosting service only. The money-back guarantee does not apply to most add-on products, such as domains, given the unique nature of their costs.
If you cancel within 30 days and your plan includes a free domain, there will be a fee to retain that domain. Bluehost will deduct a non-refundable domain fee from your refund, at the regular cost of your domain.
Bluehost does not offer any refunds for cancellations that occur after 30 days.
IS BLUEHOST RECOMMENDED BY WORDPRESS?

Yes, Bluehost is a recommended hosting provider by WordPress. Bluehost offers specialized WordPress Hosting plans that are optimized for the platform, as well as WooCommerce Hosting plans for eCommerce websites. This ensures that websites built on WordPress have optimal performance and security. Users love our user-friendly interface and one-click installation of WordPress, which make it easy for anyone to set up and manage a website.

We also invite you to learn more about WonderSuite, an easy WordPress website builder.

CAN I GET PROFESSIONAL EMAIL HOSTING?

Yes, professional email plans are available through Bluehost. Google Workspace is a popular option for professional email hosting, and can be integrated with many web hosting plans. With professional email hosting, users can have a custom email address with their domain name, giving a more professional look and feel to their communications.

WHY CHOOSE BLUEHOST?

Bluehost is a top-rated web hosting provider that offers reliable and affordable website hosting plans with easy-to-use tools. With 24/7 customer support, domain name registration, and specialized WordPress and WooCommerce hosting options, Bluehost is a great choice for individuals and businesses looking to launch a successful website.
