Activate and automate.

Empower employees to act with the right information, automate the mundane, and orchestrate next-best actions that deliver personalized experiences at scale.

“Having this platform allows us to quantify our performance as we continue our CX journey and focus on strategic customer obsession. We are investing where it matters because if it matters, we should see it in the bottom line.”

Head of Customer Experience
GOVERNMENT

“The whole point is we don’t just want raw data. We want information. We want actionable data trends that the field finds valuable. That’s the strategic value of a company like Medallia."

Director of CX Measurement and Data Analytics
INSURANCE

“We have quantified a correlation between NPS growth and new business growth. Having quantified that, we can comfortably say that given a 125% NPS growth in the last two years, there’s a direct new business growth and bottom-line impact. The platform is a key enabler of our success.”

VP, Head of Customer Voice and Obsession
HEALTHCARE

“Because we provide better service and are able to answer their issue, they call back less frequently. From all these different things, we have seen a material reduction in digital call after rates and expenses related to repeat calls.”

Head of Enterprise Customer Experience

Between the technology and the team, Medallia continues to offer best-in-class solutions for customer-obsessed organizations. I have been a Medallia customer for 8 years and am very much looking forward to the next 8+!
