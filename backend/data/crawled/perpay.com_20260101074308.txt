1 Access to the Perpay Marketplace is offered by Perpay, Inc., and is only available to eligible consumers residing in the United States. The Perpay Marketplace is subject to credit approval. Applying for a Perpay account will not affect your FICO®  or Vantage® score. However, we may obtain information from Clarity which may affect your credit profile with this alternative credit bureau.

2 The Perpay Credit Card is subject to credit approval. Not available to residents of New Hampshire. The Perpay Credit Card is issued by Celtic Bank. Applying for a Perpay account will not affect your FICO® or Vantage® score. However, we may obtain information from Clarity which may affect your credit profile with this alternative credit bureau.

3 With automatic transfers enabled on the Perpay Credit Card.

4 The credit score (VantageScore 4.0) increase of 32 points is based on the average of approximately 80,000 Perpay+ customers with a baseline credit score of 550 or below during the first three months of reporting. The same group observed an average credit score increase of 55 points over a two-year period if they maintained on time payments both on and off Perpay’s platform. Credit score improvement is not guaranteed, and individual results may vary based on a number of factors.  Perpay will report your transactions to Experian®, Equifax®, and TransUnion®. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payments may result in payment reporting to credit bureaus that may negatively impact your credit score. This product will not remove negative credit history from your credit report. Perpay+ is only available to eligible Marketplace account holders. Fees apply. See the Perpay Terms and Conditions for more details.

5 See our Cardholder Agreement for details on fees and interest for the Perpay Credit Card.
