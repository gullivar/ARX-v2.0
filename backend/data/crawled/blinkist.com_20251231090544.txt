Upskillers

Life changing. The concept of being able to grasp a book's main point in such a short time truly opens multiple opportunities to grow every area of your life at a faster rate.

Leaders

Most CEOs read a book a week. Many use programs like this to acquire key concepts that help them keep a fresh perspective helping hone vision, strategy and action.

Lifelong learners

This is simply the coolest app that exists. Deserved full credit. It's much nicer to spend your time learning new knowledge, rather than spending hours browsing social media.
