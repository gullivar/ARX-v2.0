The Inception Lingerie has always been talked about in hushed voices in our country. It is a pain for women to shop from neighbourhood lingerie stores which generally leads to awkward and embarrassing conversations. It all started when we noticed how we never found bras of our size or fit at our local lingerie stores. So, what was a causal observation at first, slowly became a movement as more like-minded women endorsed the idea – yes, ladies' innerwear in India left much to desire. Undergarments primarily are sold from small stores across India and mainly under a male gaze. Women could not ask what they wanted, or worse still, most did not know their correct size. There was an absolute lack of understanding of buying a bra or undergarment that fits your bust shape. Until recently, only vanilla options existed in the lingerie category, and anything that offered even a little bit extra by solution, design, or fashion was exorbitantly expensive. We felt that the evolution of the undergarment category had not kept pace with the fast-changing outerwear fashion, and there existed a significant gap in lingerie for women in India. Upon more profound research, we found that the existing distribution channels restricted the availability of the correct sizes of innerwear and the flow of customer feedback back to the lingerie brands, leading to a lack of innovation and variety. We realized that an online platform for lingerie shopping could do wonders for women to pick the right size and fit of undergarments from the privacy of their homes with the proper assistance. It was also an excellent channel for us to understand the complex needs of Indian women divided by seasons, fashion choices, size and undergarment requirements. With the expansion of internet penetration in the country, online shopping in India has become a way of line. Also, the already existing gap in the lingerie business set the stage for us. So we decided to take the plunge into the world of lingerie, and Clovia happened! We started in 2013, and since then, there has been no looking back. Mind To Wardrobe Clovia is a full-stack lingerie brand, which controls every part of its supply chain from what we call a mind-to-wardrobe. We design in-house, hand-pick our raw materials and manufacture in exclusive controlled facilities, ensuring 4-levels of quality controls, and we sell through a host of sale channels. Every product we create is first made in small quantities, monitored via a state-of-the-art backend technology, which predicts future sales (based on sales patterns and customer feedback) and recommends the styles and numbers that should be manufactured further. To help our customers pick the bra with the perfect fit, we developed a tool called the Clovia bra size calculator . All you need to do is, mention the size of your band, your cup size, the features you look for in your size and voila - we provide you with the right bra size in just 2 min! It led to the beginning of a trustworthy fast fashion brand that is low on cost (as the middlemen are cut out), high on consumer appeal (thanks to our years of combined design experience in-house), super-efficient on inventory and built entirely on consumer feedback. The cost that we save due to these efficient practices is transferred back to our customers in the form of a premium, affordable product.
