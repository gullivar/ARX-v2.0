Put your learning to the test with interactive exams

Challenge yourself with coding exercises that provide instant feedback and unlimited tries. Learn by doing and keep improving with every attempt.

Jeffrey has been teaching and inspiring me for at least 7 years now. He is one of the main reasons I chose Laravel and Vue. He has an incredibly effective method of teaching and explains complex concepts in a concise and easily accessible way. It's not an exaggeration to say I wouldn't be where I am without him.

Sorting Users by Related Table Columns in Laravel API

Hi, I want to implement sorting on my users table using some columns from related tables — for example, date_of_birth from the profiles table and status from the tickets table — combined with columns from the users table itself. Currently, I’m constructing the URL like this: http://localhost:8000/authors?search=Co&searchBy=first_name&sort=profiles.date_of_birth,users.st

Restrict access based on subscriptions Laravel Cashier

Hi all. I've just installed Cashier and made some tests and it works great. I created a product on Stripe with 2 prices (montly payments and one time payment) Both prices should give access to the same content but I don't know how to restrict from viewing certain parts of my website or "block" certain routes (like creating posts). My app is a simple nwesportal website

Create a function to be called by every other function i a controller

In my application, I want to create a function that will contain some basic tasks to be executed before presenting data in the app views. I.e. I want every view at its top to have the name of the company which will be no static but will be fetched dynamically from the database. Obviously I do not want to repeat this query analytically in every method in the controllers. I want

Probably the most "must-watch" web development screencasts on the internet.

As a web designer trying to evolve into a developer, I was blown away at how clearly Jeffrey presents concepts while providing a nice challenge curve. Signing up for a paid account was a no brainer.
Mary-Ann Zykin
My lifetime Laracasts membership has been one of the most immediately useful and continually valuable tools in my developer toolkit. From jumping into a new IDE, or reinforcing best practices, it's one of the first references I turn to.
Sherri W.
I'm not primarily a PHP developer anymore, but I'd be one of the first to recommend Laracasts. Hell, I still watch videos now to keep up to date with the latest Vue, PHP and laravel features. One of the best investments of my career.
Amanda Rose
Laracasts has been helpful in leveling up my skill-set - not only in Laravel and PHP, but as a developer in general.
Kofi Cypher
I've been a Laracasts member for a while. Jeffrey showed me that it's okay to not understand everything at once. Programming can be hard but with enough patience and determination you can become a good programmer. He's a great teacher and human being. I love Laracast's Snippet podcast.
Selene Arzola
Laracasts is a great place to hang out and learn from one of the best programming teachers to ever teach Laravel and PHP.
Olawale Adewoyin
I bought a Laracasts subscription hoping to understand Laravel better. Not only has it done that, but it's made me a better developer in all aspects of PHP.
Matt Brunt
Laracasts is the best resource for any PHP Developer, and Jeffrey Way is the best teacher! A proud Laracasts subscriber for life.
Gerhard Botha
Before I write any code, I ask myself "What would Jeffrey do?" Odds are, he's covered it in depth on Laracasts!
Andre Madarang
Laracasts has made me a better developer in not only Laravel/PHP, but in programming in general. With every screencast, I've learned something new. I highly recommend it!

While I don't code in PHP for my current job, I always check out Laracasts for the tools and patterns that I can apply in the different languages I work in. Worth every penny!
Eric Peterson
Laracasts has made me a better developer. Not just a Laravel developer, but a better developer on the whole.
Anurag
I'm not just a new Laravel user, I'm a new web developer in general. Let me tell you, I wouldn't be coding anything now if it weren't for Jeffrey's excellent teaching.
Stephen Finney
If Heisenberg cooked screencasts, this would be his cookbook.
Kyle Ferguson
Jeffrey's ten minutes of pedagogic instructions has taken me to the next level in web development. It's an amazing site packed with aha moments.
Rocky Montana
Excellent video, excellent examples... I've nothing to say except very well done Jeff. You're amazing. I never regret my monthly subscription.
Caporal Dead
Learning has never been this fun. Jeffrey is by far the best teacher I've ever had. He makes learning Laravel as easy as ABC.
Damilola Ogunmoye
All the knowledge that Jeffrey shares with us is simply invaluable!
Sahib Alejandro
Jeffery Way IS that ternary machine that can run any algorithm. You learn to just except his infinite awesomeness, because it just hurts your head to think about it too much!
Dustin Woodard
I've always preferred learning programming languages with online courses and videos. Well, let me tell you: from all videos I've seen, to all the University classes I've taken, I've never seen a better instructor than Jeffrey. You actually get attached to his screencasts like you would to a TV Show!
