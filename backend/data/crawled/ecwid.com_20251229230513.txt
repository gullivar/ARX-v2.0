Stay connected with automated emails triggered by customer actions, such as post-purchase follow-ups or cart abandonment reminders.

Schedule discounts on your products, and set start and end times for them to run during specific periods like Black Friday.

Upload your product catalog and assets, and watch as the ad platform creates and optimizes your campaigns. Sit back and see the results.

With just one click, give your product images a professional look. AI removes the background and enhances images instantly.

Automate store management

Domain names and SSL
Tax calculations
Payments
Shipping

Buy your own domain on Ecwid, and have it automatically connected to your store. Plus, get a free SSL certificate, all at a discounted, locked-in fee.

Taxes don't have to be a hassle. Calculate tax rates automatically at checkout based on the store and customer's location in real-time.

Get paid easily. Customers complete their purchases in your store, and your selected payment provider handles the processing and verification of funds before transferring them to your account.

Automate shipping costs at checkout, label generation, inventory updates, and real-time tracking—so you can focus on closing your next sale.
