After 2025 recognition of a Palestinian state, what's next ?
The recognition of the State of Palestine by several Western countries in September, at France’s initiative, stood out as one of the key diplomatic moments of 2025. Largely symbolic for Palestinians, the move raised questions about whether it could break a decades-long geopolitical stalemate.

The church by the airport: Inside Russia’s suspected spy activities in Sweden
Just about everything about the onion-domed Russian Orthodox church near the otherwise unassuming Swedish city of Vasteras seems odd: its close proximity to the airport, its taller-than-planned spire, and its elusive priest allegedly commended by the Kremlin’s foreign spy agency, SVR. Swedish intelligence services think so too, and have warned that Moscow is likely using it as a platform for espionage and other hostile hybrid activities potentially threatening Sweden’s national security.
Searching for radioactive waste in the depths of the Atlantic
For nearly five decades, more than 200,000 barrels of radioactive waste were dumped in the icy depths of the northeast Atlantic. Today, no one knows precisely where these barrels are located, or what kind of state they are in. On June 15, a French-led team of scientists will set sail from Brittany in a bid to map the barrels and assess their impacts on surrounding marine ecosystems.

Haiti’s independence ransom: Macron offers ‘truth’, Haitians want reparations
French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said a joint commission of French and Haitian historians would investigate the legacy of the “heavy price” Haiti was made to pay for its independence, two centuries after France extracted a crippling indemnity from its former colony. His statement made no mention of Haitian demands for reparations for the ransom imposed on the first people in the modern world to free themselves from slavery.

Archaeological treasures across Gaza have been damaged and destroyed in the war that is once more raging in the Palestinian territory.

Lithium: The white gold of the energy transition
The automotive industry’s adoption of lithium-ion batteries has turned lithium, a chemical element until now extracted in small amounts, into a strategic resource whose production will only increase.The dreamed-of transition to a fully electric future within the next 10 years has sparked a worldwide race to mine and refine this new white gold to fuel the transport of tomorrow.Home to more than 65 percent of the world’s known reserves, could Latin America’s “Lithium Triangle” formed by Argentina, Bolivia and Chile become the Saudi Arabia of the 21st century?
