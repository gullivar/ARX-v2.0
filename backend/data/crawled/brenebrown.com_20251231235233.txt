This is a collection of actionable and tactical insights that make explicit the mindsets and skill sets we need to reclaim our focus and power growth while leading from a place of connection, discipline, and accountability. My hope is that Strong Ground can serve as a playbook for everyone, from senior leaders developing and executing complex strategies to GenZers entering and navigating turbulent and complex work environments.
