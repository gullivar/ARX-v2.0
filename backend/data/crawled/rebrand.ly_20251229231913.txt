What is a link shortener?

A link shortener converts long URLs into shorter links that redirect to the original destination. Link shorteners make URLs easier to share on social media, in SMS, on print materials, and anywhere else space is limited or long URLs look unprofessional. Rebrandly is a branded link shortener, which means instead of generic short links like gener.ic/x7k2p, you create custom branded links using your own domain name like yourbrand.com/offer that build brand recognition with every click.

What's the difference between a URL shortener and a branded link shortener?

A standard URL shortener creates short links using a generic domain (like gener.ic), while a branded link shortener uses your own custom domain name in every link. Generic URL shorteners might create "gener.ic/a3x9f" while Rebrandly creates "yourbrand.com/promo" using your domain. Branded links increase click-through rates by up to 39% because people trust recognizable brand names more than random character strings. Every branded short link reinforces your brand identity and looks more professional in marketing campaigns.

How does link shortening work?

When you create a shortened link, the link shortener stores your original long URL in a database and assigns it a unique short code. When someone clicks your short link, they're instantly redirected through the shortener's server to your destination URL. This redirect happens in milliseconds. The redirect process also tracks valuable data like clicks, locations, devices, and referral sources, giving you insights into link performance.

Can I track clicks on my shortened links?

Yes, every Rebrandly link includes built-in click tracking and analytics. You can see how many clicks each link receives, where clicks come from geographically, what devices people use, and which channels drive the most traffic. This data helps you measure campaign performance, understand your audience, and optimize your marketing strategy. All tracking is available in real-time through your Rebrandly dashboard, and you can export data or integrate with tools like Google Analytics for deeper analysis.

Do shortened links expire?

Rebrandly links don't expire—they work permanently unless you manually delete them or edit the destination. This makes branded short links reliable for long-term campaigns, printed materials, or anywhere you need permanent links. You have full control to update where any link points without changing the short URL itself, so you can fix broken destinations or redirect old campaigns to new content while keeping the same memorable short link.
