FORGING THE FUTURE OF SPACE

UCF transforms bold ideas into impact by bringing people and possibility together. It’s a university defined by motion — where research becomes progress, progress attracts talent and talent drives the next breakthrough. Every effort builds on the last, creating momentum that reaches far beyond campus and shapes the future in real time.



POWERING NEXT-GEN SPACE LEADERS

INSPIRATION IN MOTION: Humanity has always looked to the stars and asked what else is out there and how do we reach it?

HANDS-ON DISCOVERY: For aerospace engineering major Ossyris Bury, that drive became a mission. She joined UCF’s Hyper program to research an asteroid predicted to pass near the moon in 2032 — turning inspiration into experience.

A UNIVERSE OF OPPORTUNITY: One of thousands of UCF students conducting real-world research, Ossyris shows how opportunity and ambition move exploration forward for everyone.



RESEARCHING BEYOND EARTH

CURIOSITY DRIVES DISCOVERY: What will it take to live beyond Earth — to breathe and thrive among the stars?

DISCOVERY INTO REALITY: Accomplished UCF physics researcher and planetary scientist Ramses Ramirez and his team have reimagined terraforming Mars by using the planet’s own resources – potentially creating a habitable world.

MOVING FORWARD: One of hundreds of UCF researchers advancing human understanding, Ramirez is helping bring the future of exploration within reach.

ADVANCING HUMAN PERFORMANCE IN DEEP SPACE

DISCOVERY IMPROVES LIFE: What happens to the body in space reveals insights that could change life on Earth.

PARTNERSHIP DRIVES INNOVATION: After spending 30 days inside NASA’s Human Exploration Research Analog, Emmanuel Urquieta, Vice Chair of Aerospace Medicine, is leading UCF’s new aerospace medicine program — the first of its kind in the nation.

TRANSFORMING CARE: This interdisciplinary effort tackles the health challenges of human spaceflight and advances how we heal people here at home.
