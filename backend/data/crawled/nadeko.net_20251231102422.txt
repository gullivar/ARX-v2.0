nadeko.net  - nadeko.net Home Announcements Community Guestbook Contact Service Status Cool sites Donate About nadeko.net Hi, I’m Fijxu, the owner and sole admin of nadeko.net. I am dedicated to hosting
privacy-focused services (and various other services) to the internet. Those
services are mainly hosted for myself, but it doesn’t make sense for me to host
privacy-focused services just for myself, so most of them are also open to the
public. Most of the privacy-focused services (and heavy services) are hosted on my
selfhosted server (Satori) at Chile (since I’m from Chile of course), but some
of them are also hosted on other servers. nadeko.net services are entirely backed by donators (for now). If you find the
services useful for you, feel free to donate here This page also serves a some sort personal webpage on some places :3 WARNING: Before you consider using my services on a daily basis, take into
account that services marked under the Satori server may go down at any time
because they are hosted with my own home Internet. So if something is not
working as intended for you, check the status page Services Satori (Chile, Self-hosted) All public services are relayed trough Koishi and have IPv6 access,
this is to keep services available when there is IP changes and show a nice
error page when the Satori server is down. The “goat” running most of the nadeko.net services, runs under AS7418 (Movistar
Chile) with a dynamic IP address that changes every 3 days. Runs NixOS, has 32GB
of RAM, 6 cores (i5-8400) and a good amount of storage. Service List Service URL Relayed?
