Why InfluxDB

Manage high-volume, high-velocity data without sacrificing performance.

High-performance at scale

Manage millions of time series data points per second without limits or caps.

Run where
you need it

Run at any scale in any environment: in the cloud, on-prem, or at the edge.

Build with the
tools you love

Easily connect to your tech stack using data standards and 5K+ easy integrations.

InfluxDB is the engine behind the real-time data pipeline.

Real-time AI requires massive streams of time series. This allows data to flow continuously through ingest, analysis, compression, and integration—fueling smarter, more autonomous systems.

See ways to get started 
High-Speed Ingest

Ingest millions of series without impacting performance.

Real-Time Analytics

Transform and analyze unlimited series in real-time.

Eviction and Lakehouse Integration

Automatically evicts cold data and streams it into lakes, warehouses, and AI/ML pipelines.

Compression and Downsampling

Best-in-class compression. Parquet files store more data with less space.

Purpose-built for the world's most demanding systems

From grid stability to satellite telemetry, InfluxDB powers the systems that can't afford to lag.

Aerospace

Aerospace telemetry never stops. Stay ahead with a database built for speed, precision, and decades of data.

Physical AI runs on time series
Predict the future based on the past.

InfluxDB captures high-resolution time series data with the precision and context AI models need to infer cause and effect, enabling real-time systems to detect, respond, and predict intelligently.

Anomaly Detection

Find failure fast—detect anomalies in real-time, trigger automated responses, and adapt as conditions change.

Predictive Maintenance

Prevent downtime before it hits. Monitor equipment health and usage patterns to predict issues and resolve them before they start.

Autonomous Optimization

Build self-correcting systems. Enable models to self-learn and adapt through continuous retraining—automatically.

Deploy anywhere

Whether you're building on-prem, in a private or multi-tenant cloud, or at the edge, InfluxDB meets developers where they are.
