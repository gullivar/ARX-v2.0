Give names and assign tags to your checks to easily recognize them later. Tap on the integration icons to toggle them on and off. Adjust Period and Grace time to match the periodicity and duration of your tasks. Simple Configuration Each check has configurable Period and Grace Time parameters.
        Depending on these parameters and time since the last ping, the check is in one of the
        following states: New. A check that has been created, but has not received any pings yet. Up. The time since the last ping has not exceeded Period . Late.
                    The time since the last ping has exceeded Period ,
                    but has not yet exceeded Period + Grace . Down.

            using a cron expression. See Cron Syntax Cheatsheet for the supported syntax features. Grace Time specifies how "late" a ping can
            be before you are alerted. You should set it to be a little above
            the expected duration of your cron job. Details and Event Log You can add a longer, free-form description to each
            check. Leave notes and pointers for yourself and
            your team. You can also see the log of received pings and sent "Down" notifications. Public Status Badges Healthchecks.io provides status badges for each of the tags
            you have used. Additionally, the "Healthchecks.io" badge
            shows the overall status of all checks in your account. The badges have public but hard-to-guess URLs.
            You can use them in your READMEs, dashboards, or status pages.

                and Teams Avert Silent Failures “I'm a happy long-time user of Healthchecks.io and keep coming back to
            it on new projects, because it's really easy to set up and offers reliable
            monitoring of all our cron jobs.” Andrej Babic , founder of PingPong “Healthchecks.io has been extremely reliable and useful
            for the many years we've been using it. The system is very easy to
            use and well designed - the UI is clear and works the way you'd expect.
            The API is really handy too.” Brett Harris , founder of WhatIsMyBrowser.com “Healthchecks.io is an absolute lifesaver. I'm using it to monitor
            an IoT gateway, and once, thanks to the quick heads-up from
            Healthchecks, was able to save the device from being fried after
            it had been accidentally placed on top of a hot router while cleaning!” Joona Heikkilä , maker “Healthchecks.io is a great service. Simple, effective, highly reliable.
            It's caught issues on multiple occasions so it makes me look
            good which is always nice.” Peter N Lewis , author of Keyboard Maestro Set up monitoring for your cron jobs, catch issues early Sign Up × Create Your Account Enter your email address .
