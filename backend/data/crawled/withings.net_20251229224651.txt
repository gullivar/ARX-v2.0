Withings has helped me monitor my lifestyle changes and helped in me achieving my 30kg weight loss, without the device I would have struggled to monitor it daily. Awesome product!

My Withings watch helped me examine my sleeping patterns and with that take measures to control my insomnia. Now everything is under control and that reflects on my overall health.

At the height of my weight loss journey Withings helped me understand the connection between maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and weight loss. I used both my Withings scale and my Sleep Mat as helpful guides in my journey.

After spending a couple of years with an inferior scale and trying to monitor my Type 2 diabetes, I found the Withings scale to be an exceptional tool for accuracy and ease of use.

Matthew

The blood pressure monitor has helped me keep track of my blood pressure and I have noticed since starting on CPAP for my sleep apnea my blood pressure is lower than before.

Since I've been using Withings products, I've had a much clearer and more motivating overview of my health. The daily monitoring (sleep, activity, heart rate...) helps me to better understand my body, adjust my lifestyle and stay regular in my efforts. It's become a real ally in my well-being routine!

I love my Withings watch! I’ve had it for almost three years and it’s helped me so much. I know where I’m at in my cycle to know what steps I need to take for my body for each phase. It’s helped me be more active and set goals for myself. I love all the insight options available for your health.

Lionel

This scale has been a game-changer for me. Being able to see trends over time has kept me motivated and more aware of how my daily habits affect my progress. It’s like having a personal health assistant right in my bathroom. Highly recommend it for anyone serious about their fitness journey!

This watch may have saved my life If it weren’t for the SW2, I might not have discovered the condition I had for months or even years. The watch didn’t diagnose me - but it gave me a reason to seek medical attention. This device didn’t just track my health - it changed the course of it.
