Many art departments use Rhino on the bigger films requiring complex designs." Scott Schneider, Film Designer "Grasshopper for Rhino is one of the best platforms for computational design. It's easy to use for beginners, and the depth of possibilities make it an incredibly customizable framework for advanced users." Jose Luis García del Castillo y López, ParametricCamp "For last 10 years, Rhino has been my development tool for designing kitesurfing equipment: boards, bindings, control systems. More recently, for kite design, I've developed a 100% parametric engine in Grasshopper to automate my workflow." Dave Kay, Kiteboard Shaper Grasshopper Grasshopper is a visual programming environment tightly integrated with Rhino’s 3D modeling tools. Grasshopper requires no knowledge of programming or scripting, but still allows designers to build generative forms from the simple to the awe-inspiring.
