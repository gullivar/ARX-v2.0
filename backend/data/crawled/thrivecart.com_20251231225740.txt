Going from a third-party, scammy-looking checkout page to my own branded one really helped. And I loved ThriveCart’s dashboard. Being able to so easily see metrics let me make better decisions powered by data. GEMMA BONHAM-CARTER Course Creator School and The Passive Project I was considering Kajabi and Kartra platforms, but if I built my house on that platform I’d be paying over $1,800 per year. And when you’re starting out you want to bootstrap. DAMA JUE ThriveCart expert and strategist I do all the marketing and we’ve got a decent team of ten different people, and all I have to worry about is content and my podcast. ThriveCart has been an incredible boost for us and allowed us to publish this incredibly meaningful content that’s helped thousands of people. CHRIS HUNTLEY Course creator and owner of TheRiseToTheTop.com I’ve released ebooks and online courses through ThriveCart. I’m planning on exploring more complex sales funnels soon. KEVIN FIEDLER YouTube marketing coach It is so easy to setup a sales page or funnel, checkout and bump order with this software. They have a build in “page builder” with all the necessary components and you can simply duplicate your products to create new similar funnels. KEITH E. Web consultant The team got Pro+ setup in under an hour, and we have already seen an increase in AOV from adding an additional order bump, accepting crypto and the new reporting has been extremely helpful for our leadership team.
