Problem we can solve : Cost Of Customer Acquisition Too High To Fail
Stale, Incorrect & Limited Data
Costs Organizations That Buy It Approximately $50B+ In Wasted Customer Acquisition Effort

Existing Big Data Platforms are not designed for data that is unstructured, volatile, and time sensitive

Available firmographic and contact data is limited with typical error rates of 30 to 50%
Semantic algorithms with high accuracy require sophisticated Big Data teams and technology that most companies don’t have.
Acquired stale, incomprehensive data with limited precision is not suitable for automated machine learning driven solutions

D&B, Experian, Hoovers, Acxiom, Data.com, InfoGroup

Risk in acquired global 3rd party data

Different methodologies
Questionable match and precision

2nd Tier companies license the faulty primary data and perpetuate the problem.
