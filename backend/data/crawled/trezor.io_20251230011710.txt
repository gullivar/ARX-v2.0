Frequently
asked questions
I’ve heard big exchanges are safe now, do I really need a hardware wallet?
Even today, exchange hacks still happen, and users lose funds they thought were safe. Holding your crypto on an exchange means you don’t truly control it, the exchange does. With Trezor you stay in control of your keys, protected by industry-leading security and no third-party risk.
Will my crypto be lost if I lose my Trezor?
No—as long as you keep the wallet backup you make during setup, your crypto is safe. You can restore your entire wallet onto a new Trezor device using that wallet backup, also called a recovery phrase. It’s like having a secure recovery key. Just make sure to keep your wallet backup stored safely offline, and never share it with anyone.
Can I still use DeFi, NFTs, or swap coins with Trezor?
Yes—and securely. Trezor supports WalletConnect so you can interact with DeFi dApps like Uniswap, 1inch, or NFT marketplaces like OpenSea directly from your hardware wallet. You can trade, stake, and swap while keeping full control of your private keys.

And with Trezor Suite, our native companion app, you can buy, sell, swap, and stake selected cryptocurrencies all in the most intuitive, secure environment possible. Trade crypto with the peace of mind that your keys never leave your device.
Is owning my own crypto too technical or complicated?
Not at all. Trezor makes it simple to take control of your assets. As a non-custodial wallet, Trezor ensures only you hold the keys to your crypto. The setup process is straightforward, with an intuitive interface and clear step-by-step guidance. This makes self-custody easy, keeping your crypto securely in your hands without unnecessary complexity.
I only have a small amount of crypto. Do I still need a hardware wallet?
Yes—even if you’re starting with a small amount, protecting it now can pay off later. Crypto is a long-term game, and what’s worth a few hundred dollars today could be worth significantly more in the future. A hardware wallet like Trezor ensures that no matter how your holdings grow, they’re safe from day one.
What makes Trezor different from other crypto wallets?
Trezor is built on open-source security, with code that’s fully transparent and reviewed by experts worldwide. Unlike custodial wallets or exchanges, Trezor gives you true cold storage with offline keys that never leave your device.

Features such as an optional passphrase, phishing protection, community verification, and Tropic01—the world’s first transparent and auditable Secure Element—deliver next-gen protection that’s purpose-built for self-custody. And the new Trezor Safe 7, the first-ever hardware wallet with quantum-ready security, gives crypto owners the strongest foundation for safe and independent control of their assets for the future.
Are there hidden fees when using Trezor?
With Trezor, pricing is fully transparent, meaning there are no hidden fees or surprise costs. When you buy, sell, or swap crypto in Trezor Suite, you always see the full cost upfront and can choose the best available offer, with support for local payments where possible. When you send crypto, you only pay the standard transaction fee, which goes to the network (e.g., Bitcoin miners or Ethereum validators), not Trezor.
