Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting

ALERT [Updated March 26, 2025]

All entities created in the United States — including those previously known as “domestic reporting companies” — and their beneficial owners are now exempt from the requirement to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. Existing foreign companies that must report their beneficial ownership information have at least an additional 30 days from March 26, 2025—until April 25, 2025, for most companies—to do so. For more information.
