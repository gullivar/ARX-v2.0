BECOME A HORNETSECURITY PARTNER NOW
Johannes Port, Portformance
Partner since 2013

After our long-standing collaboration with Hornetsecurity, we can say with confidence that we are treated as true partners by a team of dedicated professionals. We are provided with a diverse portfolio of reliable solutions, with any developments being resolved in a spirit of partnership.”

The partnership between Hornetsecurity and Konica Minolta is professional and the collaboration is efficient. We have access to a comprehensive service portfolio with reliable products and we feel well supported in various matters.”

Florian Goldenstein, Konica Minolta
Partner since 2022

The quality of Hornetsecurity’s products, out of the box onboarding, responsive support and single dashboard for all products are the main reason why they were the right vendor to work with. Identifying phishing mails is way easier and the possibility the Control Panel gives users to manage their own email traffic relieves the IT admins of too many management tasks.”
