“We deal with student data, which comes with serious privacy requirements. We wouldn’t be able to do what we do without Pusher.”

Nick Tyler

Director of Engineering, GoGuardian

“In our time working together, Pusher has been one of our most reliable technology partners in that we haven't experienced any issues or downtime. The service has been flawless, and their team is super knowledgeable and has been great to work with.”

Connor Thielmann

VP of Business Operations, ServiceTitan

“The developer experience for us was fantastic. When we’re working with Pusher not only do we have the trusted infrastructure partnership, we also have all of the documentation, the snippets, the client side library which has fallbacks and stuff. It makes life a lot easier.”

Jeremy Bowers

Director of Engineering, The Washington Post

“We struggled with a lot of our infrastructure to handle a sudden spike in load. We’ve had to engineer a lot of complexity there to solve that. We haven’t had to do that with Pusher.”

Peter Hamilton

Head of Technology, Remind
