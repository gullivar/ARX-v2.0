It puts me to sleep almost immediately with its waves, while being dead silent, and my shoulders don’t feel any pain anymore in the morning. 5* for me. Dec 17, 2025 I’ve been wanting a mattress like this… I’ve been wanting a mattress like this for years. The adjustable firmness and ability to adjust pressure points throughout the night is beyond what I thought possible from a practical standpoint and cost effective solution. Now it did take a few weeks to dial in the settings and I have found that the mattress doesn’t always detect that I’m laying in it nor do I find its “Insights” to be of any value or accurate. The “Waves” feature is nice from time to time but isn’t a deal breaker. If this does get viewed by the general public I would recommend getting the pro version for the ability to customize your “Contour” as the base model may not fit your preferences. The “Concierge” did help fine tune the setup and most likely got me to where I wanted to be quicker than playing with the settings myself. Sep 27, 2025 Adjustable Sections Relieve Pain Sam Selle I have chronic lower back pain that flared up in a major way at the end of last year. Causing me to wake up every night, unable to sleep from the pain, then being exhausted throughout the day. This sent me on a journey to find a mattress that would help relieve my pain during sleep. Five mattresses, many of which had adjustable sections, and six months later I got my hands on the Byrte Pro mattress and was relieved to find it helped alleviate my symptoms! The ability to adjust each section independently allowed me to dial in a setting that worked for me! I now sleep through the night without waking up from pain and have plenty of energy for the day ahead! Thank you! Sep 16, 2025 My partner and I absolutely LOVE our... Cami My partner and I absolutely LOVE our bed. We genuinely look forward to sleeping every night, and whenever we leave on trips we say that we’ll miss the bryte bed lol. We also love to wake up and compare insights, it’s become a fun routine for us. When I was younger, I never really thought twice about the quality of my sleep, but it has become a lot more clear to me how important it is (which makes sense… I mean we have to do it every single day). Now that I’m actually getting good sleep, it seems obvious that we should all invest in an amazing mattress. Before this, I had been struggling with some neck and upper back pain for a while. For the past few years I felt like I was always waking up and had something negative to say about my sleep, and I feel like I never woke up rested. Now I can confidently say I’m getting the best sleep of my life and I’m only a month in. I can’t recommend getting a bryte bed enough!!! Also—the waves are game changing. I’m an anxious person, and sometimes I have such a hard time shutting my brain off. This feature is the perfect tool to help me practice mindfulness and calm my mind so I can sleep. Aug 10, 2025 I love my Bryte bed Melissa I love my Bryte bed. The adjustments it makes really help eliminate pain from my hips. I look forward to checking the app each morning to see how well I slept. If you need help falling asleep at night, the gentle rolling waves are wonderful. We are really happy with our purchase. Mar 16, 2025 The best Mattress in the world Randolph Moorer I stumbled upon the incredible world of sleeping on a Bryte Bed while staying at Wander.Com properties. It was like sleeping on clouds! I had the most restful sleep of my life, and I knew I had to have one in my own home. What makes these beds so special is that you can customize the firmness to your liking. The onboarding app asks a few questions to suggest a firmness, and mine (55) and my wife’s (45) were perfect. The bed’s active pressure relief continuously adjusts to your movement, so there are no pressure points that can wake you up during the night. I’ve never slept better in my life. I highly recommend these beds to anyone who wants a good night’s sleep. Feb 2, 2025 Love my bed! Betty My Bryte bed has improved my energy, improved my morning aches and pains when rolling out of bed. I love my bed. It’s the best investment in myself I ever made!
