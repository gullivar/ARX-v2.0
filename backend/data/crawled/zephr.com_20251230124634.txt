Leverage the power of AI—one paywall at a time

Zephr’s AI engine takes the guesswork out of conversion strategy. Instead of static rules or one-size-fits-all paywalls, Zephr uses behavioral data and machine learning to display the right access model—at the right time—to each unique user.

Leverage AI-driven paywall optimization to personalize engagement across every stage of the subscriber journey:

Soft Paywalls: Offer limited freemium access to build trust before prompting subscription.
Metered Paywalls: Allow a set number of free reads to nurture first-time visitors and encourage return engagement.

Hard Paywalls: Target loyal, high-intent readers and convert them into paying subscribers.
Dynamic Paywalls: Continuously adjust messaging and timing using behavioral insights to optimize conversion and reduce churn.
Personalize every touchpoint with real-time behavioral insights

Zephr turns customer data into action. Connect your analytics, CRM, and marketing tools to serve personalized offers, messages, and pop-ups that adapt to each user in real time—based on behavior, lifecycle stage, and engagement signals.

By combining Zephr’s in-product data with your existing martech stack, you can orchestrate precise, data-driven campaigns that drive measurable impact across key metrics:

Increase conversion rates by triggering the right subscription offer at the right moment.
Reduce customer acquisition cost (CAC) by replacing blanket messaging with personalized experiences.
Boost lifetime value (LTV) through deeper, ongoing relationships that respond to each subscriber’s behavior.
Prevent churn with automated win-back campaigns and contextual offers that re-engage lapsed users.
Personalized subscription packages tailored to your customers

Turn personalization into profit. Zephr’s Dynamic Offers Module enables your team to create, test, and launch subscription packages that align with each customer’s preferences, engagement history, and lifecycle stage—all without code..
