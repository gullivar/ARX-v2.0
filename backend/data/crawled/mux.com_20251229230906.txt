While you perfect your AI models, we take care of encoding, delivery, and scaling your video output reliably and cost-effectively.

Synthesia built their AI video platform on Mux enabling them to affordably scale video generation while focusing on AI innovation rather than building video from scratch.

With videos ready for playback in an average of under 2 seconds you can build what you need for your community.

Glassdoor launched user-generated video and created a new form of content-moderated community engagement in their app in 5 months.

Whether it’s on-demand or live, build video that scales to support your users.

Patreon built native video for a more consistent creator and fan experience, going from limited control with third-party solutions to a fully customized, seamless platform..

Mux love from around the world

Working with the Mux team felt like we were all working together, as opposed to the typical vendor/client relationship. Mux was with us every step of the way, from ideation to delivery.

Lucas Kacher 
Staff Software Engineer +  Engineering Lead for Video

Ran our first live stream via @MuxHQ today after some horrible experiences with a well known alternative who shall remain nameless. Super simple, reliable and looked great!

Will Wilson

Twitter, or I guess it's called X now

We researched, candidly, every single option. Mux kept coming up as the number one ease of integration was amazing that it's just a couple of lines of code and "boom".

Will Baumann
CEO

We were stressing about how long it would take to fix our video streaming, but I was able to open up Github mobile and integrate Mux on my phone. I had something working in two hours. That’s wild.

Gaurav Misra
Co-Founder and CEO

We built an in-house MVP solution for video, but rather than spending our engineering team’s time navigating and maintaining video infrastructure, we turned to Mux. With Mux, video just works, which means we can focus on building the best product for Substack creators and trust that video is solved.

Jairaj Sethi 
Co-founder and CTO

the documentation and API design for the @MuxHQ api is some of the best I've used in a while - insanely clean UI and has api reference or webhook for everything I need

Mux has enabled us to move 5x faster. We can trust processes like uploading and transcoding are handled really well — and we didn’t have to spend the time and resources on our end building that out.

I could have created a custom solution like Amazon S3 to host my video, but it was extremely complex and extremely expensive. And then someone said, but there is Mux and I checked it's exactly what I needed and for much cheaper than using AWS. That's why I had no choice. It was the best solution.

Bruno Simon 
Founder

AI enables video at a scale that wasn't possible before, which means cost is a huge consideration. Mux was very proactive in making sure our costs were managed.

Jake Gillespie
Engineering Manager, Synthesia

Mux Data caught a number of issues we would never have found otherwise. And beyond issues, the data helps us identify where there are opportunities for improvement.

Mark Bogdanoff
Production Engineer

Out of all the technologies we use, Mux was the easiest for us to implement. We actually over-budgeted our resources for it.

Mohammed Iqbal 
Founder and CEO

@MuxHQ is such a great product. Managed to have a live streaming solution set up for a live demo in less than a day. Was able to stream from a second device and display that stream in a player. Converted a prospect into a customer.

Martin Bean

Mux has enabled WBD to observe the quality of our viewers' streaming experiences. Being able to filter data across a variety of dimensions helps us pinpoint issues in content and technical systems to ensure that our viewers are enjoying the highest quality experience possible.

Mark Ramberg 
VP, Streaming Platform  Product Management

We’ve been able to use Mux to resolve incidents faster, sometimes significantly faster, than before. We always learn from our incidents, and the data we’re able to pull from Mux has dramatically accelerated our learnings.
