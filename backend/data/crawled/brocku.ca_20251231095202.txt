We acknowledge the land on which Brock University was built is the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee (ho-din-anish-shonee) and Anishinaabe (A-nish-shin-aaabee) people, many of whom continue to live and work here today. This territory is covered by the Upper Canada Treaties and is within the land protected by the Dish with One Spoon Wampum agreement. Today, this gathering place is home to many First Nations, Métis and Inuit, and acknowledging reminds us that our great standard of living is directly related to the resources and friendship of Indigenous people.
