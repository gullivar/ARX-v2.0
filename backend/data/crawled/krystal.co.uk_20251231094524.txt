Nothing has been too much trouble for these people. I have no hesitation in recommending Krystal to anyone in search of a reliable web host. Barrie Mahoney Krystal Hosting are utterly amazing! Krystal Hosting are utterly amazing! Their mission could easily be to "restore faith in humanity", based on their service levels! With so many awful hosting companies out there, Krystal Hosting could simply rest on their laurels, and deliver an okay service, and still be a shining example. But instead, they seem to have set their own standard, which is clearly one of unparalleled excellence. Rachel Wild Highly recommend to businesses and consumers alike What really stands out, besides their unwavering tech support, is their commitment to being at the forefront of technology while holding strong to their eco-principles. Being a 100% green web hosting provider? Massive win. And it's clear they take security as seriously as they do the environment, being ISO 27001 certified. To be honest, with a hosting provider like Krystal, why would we even think of looking elsewhere? Highly recommend to businesses and consumers alike! Dan Tulloch Absolutely amazing company Absolutely amazing company. I'm fairly new to hosting and using Laravel so I've admittedly had to contact support a few times. Every time I have, the Technical Support staff I have dealt with (Matthew & Olesia) have responded within 2 minutes and managed to help me resolve issues quickly. Could not recommend more, Ben Beaumont They are always helpful I was introduced to Krystal hosting by my developer. What I love about this company is that it has great customer support. Whenever I need something they are always helpful and they reply very quickly! Maria Rolles Happy as a clam! Krystal's hosting has been exceptional - they're always cordial and quick to respond to all my managed WordPress and domain needs. They were recommended by an industry mentor two years ago, and I couldn't be more grateful. Krystal is so outstanding that I've transferred all my WordPress sites to them. Happy as a clam! Sarp Metin Really good company to work with Really good company to work with. We have a large server with many websites, and they are quick to help with ticket responses and very helpful fixing issues or fault finding. Highly recommend. John Emmett I couldn't recommend them enough Having been with Krystal for about 2 years now, I couldn't recommend them enough. I host numerous websites with them, never had any problems. Steven in Technical Support is super helpful and has always helped with any queries I've had. Cameron Cox Couldn't ask for anything else I've used Krystal to host websites for my clients for many years now, the customer support is amazing, they always solve the issues I'm having and are super knowledgeable. No matter how silly the question is, they always help, super quick, honestly couldn't ask for anything else! Daniel Grosso The best I have tried Great hosting company. The best I have tried. They always provide an excellent service, expert advice and technical support that is second to none. Surya Osborne Consistently impressed I've been with Krystal for a few years now, and I'm consistently impressed by the exceptional service and technical support they provide. I'm proud to be a customer of this professional, British, eco-conscious, and reliable hosting company. Lewis Stevens We are so happy with Krystal We've recently switched from a monthly subscription to an annual subscription because we are so happy with Krystal's service and we very much align with their good ethics. Tapocketa Studio Their support is first class! As well as offering great web hosting packages and domains at really good pricing points their support is first class! Always an amazing quick response for support via their UK based Live Chat within minutes. Always incredibly helpful and get issues fixed. I continue to use and recommend Krystal to my clients! Charles Buckley I couldn't be happier I moved to Krystal and I couldn't be happier. Half the price and triple the service. Their Live Chat is excellent, and they answer within minutes. I'm also on an SSD server too, so my webpage loading is fast - and I mean fast! Mike Wild Absolutely fabulous! Absolutely fabulous! I honestly cannot fault the service that Krystal have given me. When my website went down, they fixed it within 10 minutes to ensure it was restored to a previous backup. Polite, helpful and so reassuring. Thank you! Kiemia Farrow This one cuts the mustard I really like Krystal for their customer first approach and register all my domains via them. I have been with other hosting providers but this one cuts the mustard. I recommend them highly rather than corporate conglomerates Andrew Flash Ultra-reliable hosting Ultra reliable hosting. Any queries I have had have been responded to very quickly and always either resolved to my satisfaction or a full explanation given as to why what I'm asking isn't possible or some other system's fault! Overall an outstanding service. Angus Brown I recommend you to everyone I absolutely love the support Krystal gives. It's absolutely top notch and I hope it never changes. So good and I recommend you to everyone. Ben Davies Always go the extra mile Krystal is awesome. Always experience excellent customer service, and you always go the extra mile with all the add-ons and little features no one else seems to bother with. Whenever we do migrations from new customers' hosts it just underlines how much better your offering is. Ed Schofield I am so glad I found Krystal The migration was painless and the support amazing. Since then the support has continued to be five star, plus, plus. The support team does go above and beyond what would be normal, and the help that is given is quick, concise and the team are always ready explain in detail if I don't understand. I am so glad I found Krystal Hosting and I highly recommend them and as others have said, if I could give them more than five stars, I would. Wilf James Beyond excellent I've used Krystal for years now and I have to say that, in terms of both service and price, they are excellent. However, in terms of customer service and help, they are beyond excellent. They really go the extra mile. Not only would I strongly recommend them, I already have strongly recommended them! Fantastic. Genuinely. James Barišić If I could give six stars I would I have been a customer for about five years and from time to time I have had to ask for help. I honestly have never experienced such a high standard of customer service that is always friendly, even if you ask the silliest questions if I could give six stars I would. Russell Smith This company is wonderful This company is wonderful as my host. I have used them twice as my host. The service last time and this time when I started a new site and required hosting. Price is excellent and customer service. Previous to this company, my experience of hosting companies previous were not a patch on the service Krystal provide. Highly recommended. Robert Bull One of the best service suppliers Support staff are quick to answer any questions and solve the issues. By far one of the best service suppliers I have used in 10 years of business.
