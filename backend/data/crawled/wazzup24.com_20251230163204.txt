Let's start
We make messenger sales easier
for both managers and team leads
Clients stay in CRM
Full control for team leads
Easy to sell
Less daily grind
In touch any time, any place
CLIENTS IN CRM — NOT IN MANAGERS’ PHONE
All chats and contacts are saved in CRM. If a manager quits or goes on vacation, the chat history stays in CRM — and can be passed to a new employee in a few clicks.
THE TEAM LEAD HAS FULL CONTROL
The team lead can see every chat and track how many messages each manager sends, when they send them, and who they talk to. No more excuses.
SELLING MADE EASY
Client messages are instantly synced to the CRM. Wazzup automatically creates a deal and a contact. The entire chat is stored in the client’s card, so any manager can see the context and easily continue the chat — directly from the CRM.
MORE CLIENTS, LESS DAILY GRIND
Auto-replies and templates save time and keep you available 24/7. Even if a client reaches out after hours — their message won’t go unanswered.
ALWAYS CONNECTED — ANYWHERE
By the water cooler, on the road, or even in line at the ATM — your managers can message clients right from the Wazzup mobile app. All chats are synced to your CRM.
Employees can access the mobile app via their Wazzup personal account
The interface doesn’t get in the
way – it helps
Familiar features

Wazzup keeps all the features you’re used to from WhatsApp, Telegram, and Viber: message statuses, emojis, voice notes, quoting

Just what you need

Managers don’t get lost in chats — they only see chats with their own clients, while the team lead sees everything

From chat — straight to the deal

No need to copy phone numbers or look for clients in the CRM. Just click the button and go directly from the chat to the deal

No message gets lost

When things get hectic, a manager may read a message but forget to reply. No need to worry! The chat stays at the top of the list, and the notification won’t go away until they send a reply

Attach images and files

Managers can send any files directly from the CRM through the client’s preferred channel. Important documents won’t get lost in email anymore — everything is saved in the CRM
