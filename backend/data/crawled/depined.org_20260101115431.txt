Providers supply unused compute and earn yield. Startups & enterprises access compute, APIs, rendering, and AI services without needing DevOps or contracts. Stakers fuel the network by locking $DEPIN and $dUSD into vaults, and to pay monthly RWA compute contracts. Every transaction — from API calls to rendering jobs — is settled in $dUSD, a compute-backed stablecoin tied directly to RWA enterprise contracts. This creates a fair, transparent, and efficient marketplace where everyone wins. Apply to join our AI portfolio Incubations, where we help you on your journey.
