 The Great Reset: Will the Labour Codes improve ease of doing business?
The Centre has finally notified the four Labour Codes, which are expected to reduce the compliance burden, improve ease of doing business and benefit the labour force. But the long-awaited reforms have evoked mixed reactions.

LABOUR CODES WELL BEGUN HALF DONE
Business Today Magazine’s latest issue examines one of the most consequential shifts underway in India’s economic and institutional landscape: the reordering of the relationship between labour, enterprise, and growth. At a moment when global supply chains are under strain, capital is increasingly selective, and competitiveness hinges on execution rather than intent. India is attempting a structural reset that could redefine its investment climate and employment framework for decades. The focus is on how regulatory simplification, formalisation of work, and clearer accountability mechanisms intersect with the realities faced by businesses, workers, and policymakers on the ground. This issue goes beyond headline reforms to interrogate what really determines outcomes—implementation, state capacity, and institutional coherence. Equally, it reflects on the lived realities of modern employment—from traditional industry to emerging work arrangements—highlighting why enforcement, clarity, and trust will ultimately decide whether reform translates into durable advantage. All this and more in the latest issue of Business Today Magazine. Out on stands now.

THE MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Business Today Magazine’s Most Powerful Women in Business issue enters a new chapter—one that places profitability at the centre of leadership. Anchored in BT500’s shift toward data-driven evaluation, BT MPW 2025 identifies 100 women leaders from companies with a minimum ₹100 crore consolidated profit in FY25. These leaders helm India’s strongest, most resilient enterprises, with top women-led firms more than doubling profits since FY20. The list also welcomes a fresh cohort while spotlighting exceptional women from unlisted firms, global organisations, and policymaking roles. Beyond performance metrics, the BT MPW issue examines the unseen barriers women continue to navigate—the cultural expectations, invisible workload, and structural hurdles that shape their professional journeys. All this reflects a clear truth: women are not only shaping Indian business, they are steering some of its most profitable and future-ready organisations. Business Today Magazine’s BT Most Powerful Women 2025 special issue - Out on stands now.

INDIA'S BEST B-SCHOOLS
India’s management education ecosystem stands at a pivotal transition. While demand for MBA programmes continues to surge, the landscape is being reshaped by muted hiring cycles, rising fees, slower salary growth, and shifting expectations from industry. This issue of Business Today examines how B-schools must evolve beyond legacy formats to remain relevant in an economy defined by AI, geopolitical unpredictability, and a changing corporate talent pipeline. The latest BT-MDRA rankings highlight not just institutional performance but the emerging divergence between established IIMs and ambitious private schools striving to differentiate through new programmes, multi-campus models, and industry-aligned curricula. From integrated degree formats to an increased push towards executive and doctoral programmes, the centre of gravity is slowly moving from traditional two-year MBAs to continuous learning. Yet challenges persist: declining return on investment, reduced industry-sponsored projects, and uneven alignment between academic training and employer needs. The issue underscores a broader imperative—Indian B-schools must balance research depth, globalisation, ethical leadership, and practical career outcomes to stay ahead of a shifting corporate world. All insights, rankings, trends, and data—now in the latest Business Today issue. On stands & online.

AI OR DIE
India’s technology journey has reached a defining inflection — one where legacy models meet the disruptive force of Artificial Intelligence. From TCS and Infosys to Wipro and HCL Tech, India’s IT bellwethers that once powered a global outsourcing revolution are now at a crossroads, confronting slower growth, margin pressures, and the existential need to reinvent. As AI transforms workflows, redefines talent, and redraws the contours of value creation, these giants are pivoting from cost-efficiency to capability with investments of billions in data infrastructure, AI platforms, and innovation hubs. The sector that once thrived on labour arbitrage is now racing to build intelligence advantage. This transformation marks not just a cyclical shift but a structural reset, one that could determine whether India’s IT leadership endures or erodes in the era of ‘intelligence outsourcing’. All this and more in the cover story ‘Reinventing Indian IT’ from Business Today’s latest issue – On Stands Now.

INDIA'S 100 BEST MUTUAL FUNDS
Business Today’s latest issue marks a milestone moment in India’s investment journey — revisiting the pioneering partnership with Value Research that began over three decades ago, when mutual funds were still a mystery for most Indians. From 89 schemes in 1993 to over 1,800 today, the industry’s evolution reflects how disciplined, process-driven investing quietly transformed savers into wealth creators. At the heart of this issue lies The Quiet Revolution — the story of how India’s investors learned that consistency, not prediction, drives real returns. It captures the shift from speculation to system, from timing the market to trusting the process, and from chasing trends to building wealth one SIP at a time. This edition brings together insights, data, and reflections that trace the arc of India’s mutual fund revolution — from the first fund ratings published in Business Today to today’s ₹78-lakh-crore industry. It’s a guide, a reckoner, and a reminder that in investing, as in life, boring often works best. All this and more in Business Today’s latest issue — On Stands & Online!
