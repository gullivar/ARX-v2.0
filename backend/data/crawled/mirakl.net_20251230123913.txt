BlogBuilding a high-performance, sustainable retail media program (Part 1)
December 22, 2025
Cédric Epiard
Retail Media
Part 1: Field-tested foundations for retailersThis series is based on my operational experience — primarily at Cdiscount, a pioneer of retail media in France. Every retail context is unique, so my goal isn't to deliver universal truths. Instead, I'm sharing practical, battle-tested guidance you can apply to build a retail media program that drives real results.As VP of Product for Mirakl Ads, I've seen firsthand how retailers of all sizes can capture sustainable value from retail media. Whether you're just starting to explore monetization or looking to optimize an existing program, the principles and frameworks in this series will help you navigate the journey with confidence.The opportunity: Building monetization programs that work for everyoneThe objective is clear: enable any retailer to build a monetization program that benefits end customers, brands and sellers — without ceding all the value to platforms like Amazon or Walmart.Cdiscount's journey illustrates what's possible. We grew from €0 to more than €73M in seven years on retail media including sponsored products, long before "retail media" became a buzzword. 1, 2, 3Our success was driven by iteration, performance rigor and an unwavering focus on delivering value to all stakeholders. Growth remains strong, with +9% in Q2 2025.So, why did a French player emerge so strongly in retail media?The answer is a combination of several factors that aligned:Critical mass: Cdiscount achieved Tier 1 scale, creating the audience reach advertisers demand.Rapid, large-scale marketplace opening: A broad seller base generated diverse inventory and advertising opportunities.Very open, non-curated seller model: This approach maximized selection and created consistent demand for visibility."Best price" DNA and ancillary revenue history: With low margins and ad sales dating back to 2005, monetization was embedded in our strategy from the startThese lessons apply beyond Cdiscount.For any retailer operating a marketplace or eCommerce platform, retail media represents a high-margin revenue stream that complements your core business while enhancing the customer experience — when executed correctly, that is.Build sustainable success: A progressive, iterative journeyBuilding a high-performance retail media program isn't a one-time project. It's a collective endeavor that spans multiple disciplines and evolves over time.No fluff here — just practical feedback so retailers can capture a fair, sustainable share of value while serving end customers, brands and sellers.Retail media monetization is progressive and iterative by nature.It involves internal teams across your organization (site/front-end, marketing, search, product/tech) and external partners (brands, sellers, agencies, customers). Success depends on coordination, transparency and shared objectives.In this first part of our series I’ll focus on three critical foundations:The core stakeholder groups and their objectivesThe inherent tensions between these groups — and how to balance themA preview of the maturity journey we'll detail in subsequent partsUnderstanding these dynamics is essential before you can build a sustainable program.Let's dive in.Stakeholders objectives and how to balance tensionsEvery retail media program must serve three primary stakeholder groups, each with distinct objectives and challenges. The key is understanding what drives each group and where their needs intersect — or conflict.1. The sales house (ad operations)Objectives: Maximize advertising revenue (on-site, data, services) and margin (revenue minus HR and tech costs) across endemic and non-endemic demand.Challenges:Build a clear, productized offering: Define your formats, inventory, pricing/floors and packages in a way that's easy for advertisers to understand and buy.Decide sales coverage: Determine whether to build a specialized team or leverage your existing salesforce.Professionalize operations: Establish robust processes for forecasting, pacing, fill rate management and ACOS/ROAS pressure.The ad operations team is the revenue engine of your retail media program. Their success depends on having the right tools to manage inventory, optimize yield and demonstrate clear value to advertisers. Without strong operational foundations, even the best strategy will fail to scale.2. End customers and the websiteObjectives: Protect and improve the shopping experience.Challenges:Avoid ad overexposure and noise: Too many ads or poorly placed placements degrade the experience and drive customers away.Ensure relevance: Ads must align with queries, categories and product quality standards.Orchestrate with business rules: Balance competing priorities like first-party vs. third-party products and strategic categories.Control critical placements: Protect high-value positions and manage perceived cannibalization of organic listings.The customer experience is non-negotiable.Retailers who prioritize short-term ad revenue at the expense of relevance and user satisfaction ultimately undermine both their brand and their retail media program.The good news? Modern technology — particularly AI-powered solutions — can automate relevance targeting and protect the shopping experience at scale.AI in retail media goes beyond basic automation to continuously learn from live data, ensuring ads remain contextually relevant while maximizing monetization opportunities.3. Sellers and brandsObjectives: Grow GMV under margin and resource constraints.Challenges:Minimize activation and optimization effort: Advertisers need simple onboarding and intuitive campaign management.Master ACOS/ROAS with transparent levers: Provide clear tools and reporting so advertisers understand what's working and why.Prove value and provide clear management: Start with managed service support for new advertisers, then transition to guided autonomy as they gain confidence.Sellers and brands are your customers in a retail media program. Their satisfaction directly impacts participation rates, campaign budgets and long-term retention.Large brands need sophisticated campaign management capabilities with granular data for optimization.Smaller advertisers require comprehensive automation that includes not just targeting and bidding, but also product selection — enabling them to launch impactful campaigns in under a minute.For retailers operating on platforms like Mirakl, campaign budgets can be automatically deducted from seller balances, eliminating invoice management friction and accelerating adoption.The core tension: Maximizing revenue without degrading experienceHere's the natural tension at the heart of every retail media program: Maximizing ad revenue and advertiser satisfaction without degrading customer experience.This isn't a theoretical problem. It's the daily challenge that determines whether your program thrives or stalls.The resolution lies in disciplined prioritization of the end user and product quality, coupled with transparent guardrails and measurable outcomes.Specifically:Focus on relevance: Only serve ads that align with shopper intent and context.Establish clear controls: Use floor prices, placement management and targeted ACOS settings to balance revenue with experience.Measure what matters: Track not just revenue metrics but also customer satisfaction indicators like click-through rates, conversion rates and return visitor behavior.Iterate based on data: Use transparent reporting to understand what's working and adjust quickly.When you get this balance right, everyone wins.Customers discover relevant products, advertisers see strong ROAS and retailers capture high-margin revenue while strengthening their platform.What's next: Understanding maturity levelsBuilding a sustainable retail media program is a journey, not a destination.In Part 2 of this series, we'll explore the maturity framework that guides this journey — breaking down the key building blocks, metrics and levers for action at each stage.You'll learn:How to assess where your program stands todayWhat capabilities to prioritize as you scaleHow to set realistic targets and measure progressWhich tools and processes to implement at each maturity levelWhether you're launching your first campaign or optimizing an established network, this framework will help you build strategically and scale sustainably.If you're interested in understanding how AI can help you manage the complexity of balancing stakeholder needs while scaling your program, download our ebook: AI-powered retail media: How it works and why it wins.Download the eBookSourceshttps://www.cnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cnova-NV_Activity-Press-release_3Q24.pdf https://www.cnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cnova-NV_FY24-Earnings-4Q24-Activity-Press-release.pdf https://www.cnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cnova-NV_Activity-Press-release_2Q24.pdf 
Blog5 steps to unified commerce orchestration for multi-subsidiary organizations
December 12, 2025
Karthikeyan Jawahar
B2B eCommerce
As manufacturers and wholesalers scale through acquisition, they gain reach and product breadth — but also introduce commercial fragmentation. Enterprise buyers encounter separate catalogs, disconnected purchasing experiences and multiple invoices for what should be a single transaction. Internally, sales teams can’t see cross‑sell opportunities, leaving revenue on the table.Consolidating ERPs is the natural answer, but it’s not sufficient to realize the synergies planned before acquisitions.There’s a faster, less expensive path: unifying the buying experience on top of your existing systems.What is unified commerce orchestration?Unified commerce orchestration is a strategic approach to connecting all subsidiaries through a single backend while preserving their operational independence. Manufacturers offer unified product catalogs, consolidated pricing, one invoice and streamlined procurement without requiring expensive system overhauls or disrupting established operations.A unified commerce orchestration enables multi-subsidiary organizations to present a single platform to enterprise customers while preserving the operational independence that makes each subsidiary successful. And because it sits on top of your existing systems, it can deliver commercial synergies in months — not years.Here's your roadmap to get there.Step 1: Build your business case and get executive buy-inStart by mapping which enterprise customers currently buy across multiple subsidiaries: Quantify the revenue at risk if these national accounts switched to competitors offering simpler purchasing experiences.Calculate the new revenue opportunity from effective cross-selling once you eliminate visibility barriers between subsidiaries.Compare the time and cost advantages of unified commerce orchestration versus waiting for ERP consolidation. Demonstrate accelerated synergy timelines with manageable investment to secure C-suite commitment becomes significantly easier.Step 2: Select and implement a commerce orchestration platformA commerce orchestration solution must handle the complexities faced by companies operating with multiple subsidiaries: different pricing models, varying fulfillment capabilities, diverse product catalogs and unique customer requirements.This requires an adaptable architecture that enables organizations to onboard selected subsidiaries through APIs or data feeds without forcing them to abandon the core operations that already work.Key considerations when selecting a platform:Prioritize flexibility and integration capabilities over shiny lists of features. Business needs will evolve, and the platform must adapt without requiring massive reconfiguration projects.Look for solutions that establish rules-based order routing and provide dedicated backend interfaces so each subsidiary maintains control over its operations and contributes to offering a unified customer experience.The goal is to enable commercial synergies while respecting operational differences.Step 3: Pilot with select subsidiaries and customersLaunch your pilot with two or three subsidiaries that offer complementary products, then select a few key enterprise accounts to participate. This approach allows organizations to test unified catalog workflows, order routing logic and consolidated invoicing processes before exposing any issues to your broader customer base.During the pilot, addressing critical governance questions is essential: Who sets prices for cross-sell opportunities? Which subsidiary takes invoicing responsibility? How are returns or customer service inquiries that span multiple subsidiaries handled?Track metrics that matter: unified catalog adoption rates, cross-sell penetration, average order value improvements and customer satisfaction scores. These early indicators become proof points for scaling across the organization and demonstrate ROI to stakeholders who need evidence before committing additional resources.Step 4: Scale across the organizationWith pilot learnings in hand, you're ready to accelerate.Use what you learned to streamline additional subsidiary onboarding — you've already identified the integration challenges and governance questions that need addressing. Extend the unified buying experience to broader customer segments beyond your pilot accounts. This is where the platform investment pays dividends. Integrate with customer-preferred procurement systems to reduce friction in their buying processes.Optimize order routing based on real performance data rather than theoretical assumptions.Don't forget the human element. Establish centralized customer support capable of handling inquiries across all subsidiaries.This completes the "one company" experience that enterprise customers expect — after all, they shouldn't need to understand the intricacies of your organization to get help.Step 5: Extend with third-party suppliersOnce you've unified your subsidiaries, the same platform can onboard external suppliers to fill portfolio gaps. Create a comprehensive one-stop destination that meets customer needs even when you don't manufacture or distribute every product yourself.Add personalized retail media capabilities so suppliers can reach relevant audiences across your unified catalog. But there's an additional strategic advantage: You can use the platform for M&A intelligence. Test potential acquisition targets as third-party suppliers first, gathering real customer demand data and evaluating their operational performance before making acquisition decisions.When you do acquire, integration complexity drops dramatically because they're already connected to your commerce orchestration platform.This approach transforms your M&A strategy — reducing risk while providing immediate value to customers.The transformation: From fragmented operations to competitive advantageOrganizations that implement unified commerce orchestration achieve three fundamental outcomes:Accelerated synergies — Deliver commercial results in months instead of waiting years for traditional methods. Your sales teams gain cross-selling visibility immediately, and enterprise customers experience unified purchasing from day one.Seamless customer experiences — Enterprise accounts buying across your organization get single catalogs, consolidated invoicing and consistent service regardless of which subsidiary fulfills their order.Future-proofed M&A strategy — Every future acquisition integrates faster because your orchestration platform becomes the standard integration point. You've built infrastructure that makes growth easier, not harder.The time to act is nowThe cost of waiting isn't just delayed synergies — it's lost revenue, frustrated customers and competitive vulnerability. While you are debating the right approach to simplify existing systems, your competitors are implementing faster alternatives and your enterprise customers are evaluating simpler purchasing options.Unified commerce orchestration offers a pragmatic path forward: measurable results in months, minimal disruption to existing operations and a platform that makes future growth easier instead of harder.Discover your multi-subsidiary maturity level in this 1-minute quiz.
BlogSeller spotlight: How Goddiva scaled from manual operations to multichannel success with 175% GMV growth
December 12, 2025
Vianney Lacroix
Seller Spotlight
Being present on multiple channels is essential for modern retail success, yet managing multiple marketplaces can be challenging without the right tools.For fashion brands, this complexity can be the difference between scaling successfully and being overwhelmed by operational chaos.Yathukulan Kanagaratnam, Goddiva's head of technology and AI, shares how the brand achieved 175% GMV growth and turned marketplaces into their primary revenue driver with Mirakl Connect.About GoddivaGoddiva is a UK-based fashion brand specializing in occasion wear, offering evening dresses and formal attire for special events. The company has strategically expanded its presence both domestically and internationally across multiple marketplace channels, leveraging technology to scale efficiently while maintaining operational excellence.The following is a Q&A with Goddiva’s head of technology and AI Yathukulan Kanagaratnam that has been edited for clarity.How Goddiva launched its marketplace businessMirakl: How long have you been selling on marketplaces, and what motivated you to start?Yathukulan Kanagaratnam: We've actually been on marketplaces for quite some time. We started with SilkFred years ago, and we launched on Debenhams in February 2022 — our first Mirakl-powered marketplace. Our goals were straightforward: increase sales and expand brand awareness beyond our own channels. We recognized early on that customers were increasingly shopping on marketplaces, and we needed to meet them where they were.M: How has your marketplace presence grown over time?YK: We're currently selling on 13 marketplaces — seven in the UK and another six internationally. It's been quite a journey scaling to this level. When we started, we never imagined we'd be managing this many channels simultaneously. The growth has been organic but also strategic, as we've learned which marketplaces work best for our brand and our customers.How Goddiva successfully implemented its multichannel strategyM: What was your experience managing marketplaces before finding the right technology partner?YK: Honestly, it was mostly manual and incredibly time-consuming. Every marketplace had its own system, its own requirements and its own way of doing things. Our team was spending hours just keeping up with inventory updates, processing orders and managing product information across different platforms. It wasn't scalable, and we knew that if we wanted to grow, we needed a better solution.M: What made you choose Mirakl Connect to expand your marketplace strategy? YK: Debenhams actually recommended Mirakl Connect to us when we were onboarding to their marketplace. We've been using it for about 3.5 years now. What attracted us is the standardized setup that would allow us to onboard new marketplaces quickly and efficiently. M: What made the onboarding process with Mirakl Connect different from your previous experiences? YK: The onboarding process has been user-friendly overall. We currently have 12,730 child SKUs and 944 parent SKUs listed on Mirakl. Instead of building individual integrations for each marketplace, we could connect once and manage multiple platforms from a single system. In that sense, the Shopify integration is crucial for us — it's easy to sync up with our Shopify store.The business impacts of Goddiva’s multichannel strategy  M: What impact has your multichannel expansion had on your business growth?YK: The impact has been substantial. We're currently syncing three marketplaces via Mirakl, and we're hoping to launch more. The real value is in the efficiency — we can work with multiple marketplaces through a single sync, which saves enormous amounts of time. From a growth perspective, we've seen around 175% GMV growth since using Mirakl Connect. M: How important have marketplaces become to your overall business strategy?YK: Marketplaces now make up 75% of our gross income, which shows how central they've become to our business model. We're processing an average of about 7,200 orders per month across our marketplace channels. M: How has multichannel selling affected your direct-to-consumer business?YK: Interestingly, we've seen improved brand visibility thanks to our presence on other platforms. In some cases, depending on the country of the marketplace, we see different products performing better on marketplaces versus our own website. The multichannel approach has actually strengthened our overall brand presence rather than cannibalizing our DTC business.M: What are your plans for future marketplace expansion?YK: We are in discussions with major UK marketplaces through Mirakl. We’re also exploring international expansion with key EU marketplaces. It could open up significant opportunities; it's an exciting next phase for our business.From manual operations to significant business growthGoddiva's journey shows that sustainable marketplace growth requires both a clear strategy and the right technology. Their evolution from managing a handful of marketplaces manually to operating efficiently across 13 platforms and unlocking 175% GMV growth represents more than operational efficiency — it's a complete business transformation that has repositioned marketplaces as the core of their revenue model.Goddiva’s success highlights how fashion brands can leverage technology to unlock multichannel growth.Discover how fashion brand belle & bloom successfully expanded internationally with Mirakl Connect. 
NewsMirakl Launches First-Ever Advertising Campaign A Fully AI-Generated Christmas Film That Reimagines The Future of Commerce

"We chose to create a 100% AI-generated film because we don't just talk about innovation, we embody it. Just as we help the world's leading enterprises harness AI to transform their commerce operations, we've used AI to reimagine how we tell our own story. It's bold and it reflects the same pioneering spirit we bring to solving our customers' most complex challenges."Santa Quits' will run globally across digital and social channels throughout the 2025 holiday season. The campaign features three core activations: LinkedIn sponsored video targeting enterprise decision-makers, programmatic media placements on leading technology publications (with a business, tech and retail focus), and YouTube pre-roll ads appearing alongside agentic commerce and AI automation content.The 60-second film was strategically timed for release in the final days before Christmas, reinforcing the narrative that Mirakl's platform helps solve seemingly impossible challenges with moments to spare.
