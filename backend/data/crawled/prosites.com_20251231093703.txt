Take The Next Steps Success Stories Shanna Church Evans mclemoredental.com | Member Since: May 2017 "I love ProSites! We have used their service for several years and have always enjoyed excellent customer service. Several months ago we switched the confirmation service we used to PracticeMojo, the service offered with our website. PracticeMojo has been excellent and has really made life easier for our front desk staff! They have superb customer service as well. Another feature we take advantage of is the secure online forms through Dental Symphony. Our patients love being able to fill out forms securely from their smart phones or computer and it cuts down on our scanning! We are very satisfied with our service!" Dr. Steven M. Stanley stevestanleydds.com | Member Since: January 2010 "My biggest fear was not knowing how the website would work out and if it would live up to what I expected and be a good dollar value. In reality it has worked out very well and has been a very good dollar value. My favorite part of the website is that it is easy to modify or update, I get amazing customer service, and it has attracted a lot of new patients. I would tell a friend that ProSites does very nice work, they’re easy to work with, dependable, very quick responses to questions and can handle all facets of my website and internet presence." Michael Garner DDS brentwooddentistry.com  |  Member Since: August 2012 "The support that ProSites’ staff offers is excellent.  It’s the most cost-effective service we have in the practice. And its flexibility in changing our web page whenever and to whatever we feel needed. With the changing economy, we enjoy being able to address the concerns of our patients and potential patients. The support that the ProSites staff offers is excellent. They are always available with a solution to whatever our web page or e-mail needs may be."
