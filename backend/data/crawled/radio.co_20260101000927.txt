Our Customers Software was easy to use and storage on the cloud was much prefered to wide orbit or closeradiotv. It was easy to access online and support was helpful uploading music and figuring out a playlist. Very intuitive and easy to use as a broadcaster and made for first time to veteran broadcasters. Mark Maier via G2 on April 28, 2025 Radio.co has been my go to for years, firstly at Hereford FC and now Halesowen Town. Secure, stable, and very quick to respond to issues. Frank Williams via Trustpilot on March 4, 2025 So this was a cool experience with Radio.co for a non-technical person. Normally when instructions say no technical knowledge required, it doesn't apply to me. I'm glad Radio.co set me up with a good start, and now I'm off to the races. In fact, I'm over the moon with excitement. This company is amazing. Dyonne Lewis via Trustpilot on September 12, 2024 I recently moved to Radio.co from another platform (not named), and am very impressed. The platform offers loads of support including as YouTube videos, online chat & one to one video chat. After using a platform that was unreliable with hardly any support at all switching to Radio.co is certainly a breath of fresh air! Daz Hull via Trustpilot on May 22, 2024 I've tried several different radio broadcasting systems, and radio.co has the easiest-to-use service with a lot of great features. Kevin Carmony via G2 on September 7, 2021 I have only ever found joy in going on to Radio.co. Never a technical error moment or a hassle. Well done guys, amazing platform. Johan Loubser via Google on August 8, 2020 Using Radio.co is EASY. I'm a 28 year terrestrial radio veteran, and I've used MANY programs over the years. But, Radio.co is BY FAR the easiest and most efficient way to program an internet station. Jim Nash via Google on November 10, 2019 I'm very new to this and I am loving learning how this radio lark works. I'm not as brilliant as some DJs, but I will get there. The whole experience is fabulous. I get so much support and at times I really need it. I'm just loving it.
