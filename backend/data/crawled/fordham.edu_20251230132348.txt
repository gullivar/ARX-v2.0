Our Internship Promise

STEPHANIE LANE, VIDEO PRODUCER INTERN AT IHEARTMEDIA

“The Fordham name helped make my resume stand out at these bigger companies where I never thought I would have a chance. Being able to do an internship in this city, like the greatest city in the world for my industry, it really helped.”

THEO VANDENBERG, ROTATIONAL ASSOCIATE INTERN AT NEW YORK LIFE

“I had the chance to connect with individuals both within my team and across the organization. And now, having a full-time job offer at the start of my senior year makes me feel very confident and secure. Fordham set me up very well to succeed in a place like this.”

CARLEY WALKER, PERFORMANCE MARKETING ASSOCIATE INTERN AT HEARST

“I get to work at the company that owns Cosmo and Elle and Harper's Bazaar, and get to pass all these cool people at work every day and know I’m part of it. It’s very much a dream come true for me.”

JOHN GARZA, SACRISTAN ASSISTANT INTERN AT TRINITY CHURCH

“This was my first job ever. It’s taught me a lot of skills, like how to be a good team member. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of responsibility. But the people were amazing. That makes me feel good about where I work.”

JULIA SOSA, MONTEFIORE HEALTH OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM INTERN

“The meaningful relationships I was able to build throughout this program really showed me how important networking and having mentors is. And I have an amazing support system, especially at Fordham.”
