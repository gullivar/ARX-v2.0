Here’s what our clients are saying … Rich Seifrid Manager, Advanced Analytics What we needed was the ability to measure the Covid response, and Circana’s monthly sensitivities gave us the real time view of the consumer response, allowing us time to align to actions over time. We chose Circana for this effort because we have a great existing relationship with them, and the Monthly Sensitivities blends well with what we already have in place. Kiersten Hafer Vice President of Strategy and Domestic Market Development We had a very underdeveloped and underutilized product in our portfolio and we really wanted to determine how to unlock growth related to that specific product. The unique difference with the Circana solution was using consumer behavior in an in-store test using real data dollar sales to predict the impact. We learned a lot through the project and the partnership with Circana. Ben Tiener Director, Gulp Media Network, 7-Eleven 7-Eleven has worked with Circana for a long time, as our data partner of record for broader analytic purposes. As we then launched Gulp Media Network, it was a natural fit to lean on that expertise, knowledge of our business, and the capabilities that Circana brought to build audiences and and to analyze efficacy of media campaigns. When I think about Gulp Media Networks opportunities over the next year, we're excited about how we're able to bring customer data to influence media campaigns for our manufacturing partners.
