What Do WordPressians Say About Our Products?

I use this plugin on my sites. It really looks beautiful and quite functional. I really hope that the authors will continue to develop in this direction. I also want to note very quick answers from support, if you could not figure out the plugin, you can write and they will quickly respond and help with the setup.

With this Pro plugin and the “All site / all-time” license, you dont’t need anything else!

I used it to create a form to submit CV. It is highly customizable and very easy to set up. Love it.

This plugin does everything you need it to. I’ve been through many different form builders, particularly for Elementor, and this one is by far the best.That’s that from a quality perspective, but from a support lens, this gets 6 stars, easily. Very responsive & willing to do anything to elevate their product & meet your needs.Get premium…it’s worth it.
