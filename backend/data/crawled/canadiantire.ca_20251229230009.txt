If you saw part 1… you know this room was chaos. A few new shelves and some Mastercraft bins from canadiantire later and she’s looking brand new. I had no idea these tote insert trays existed, and they are so good for all of the small things. I forgot what the floors looked like in here, maybe that will be next.

Santa Paws heard you needed help spoiling your dog this Christmas. I teamed up with canadiantire to round up the toys, treats, and plushies every good pup wants under the tree. 🎄 

#canadiantire #partner
Finding the right toy for every age can feel overwhelming — so I rounded up our favorite finds for kids, all from CanadianTire. From baby toys that spark curiosity to creative sets that keep little hands busy, these are the gifts that get played with (and loved). These are all tested and approved by the toughest critics 😉#canadiantirepartner

#christmasbows #christmasornaments # #ChristmasWithTheCavalieres
The best time of the year 🎄! We went with a traditional Canadian Christmas style, and found everything we needed at Canadian Tire. It’s time to decorate, fam! 
 
#AD CanadianTire #CTPartner #Traditionalchristmas#Holidaydecor #Couple
Our kids have been sharing rooms (and closets!), keeping things organized was starting to feel impossible with so little room. So we decided to look into closet organization. This simple, budget-friendly closet system from canadiantire completely changed the space. It literally doubled the storage and made everything so much easier for the kids to see and reach,  especially with the lower rods and baskets for socks, blankets, and all the little things that usually end up on the floor. If you’ve been wanting to redo your closet without spending a fortune, this is such an easy, functional upgrade that makes a huge difference. #CanadianTirePartner

Christmas lights just hit diﬀerent when you’re a kid, and I loved all the coloured lights. So I’m
going to re-create that this year, we are going full colour with canadiantire’s NOMA MEGA LED lights, they have that perfect nostalgic glow I remember, but with all of the modern perks
(brighter, tougher, and energy eﬃcient). Here’s to lighting up those same happy, joyful
memories all over again ✨ #canadiantire
I might be a classic holiday girl (think the Home Alone house!) but everyone else in the fam goes full holiday mode and it’s 4 against 1. 😏

Good thing our new NOMA Permanent Smart Lights from canadiantire can stay up year-round and we can easily choose pre-set themes in the app for every holiday with the tap of a finger, or switch to a soft white glow for everyday nights! Now our home is glowing with cozy touches all from Canadian Tire (no one does the holidays like Canadian Tire in our expert opinion!) and ok fiiiine...I’m obsessed. 🤩 Our setup is the perfect mix of smart tech and holiday charm - see all of our holiday decor at the link in our bio. 🦌🎄✨
