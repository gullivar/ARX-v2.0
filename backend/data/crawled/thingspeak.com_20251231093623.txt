          You can send data to ThingSpeak from your devices, create instant visualization of live data, and send alerts. Collect Send sensor data privately to the cloud. Analyze Analyze and visualize your data with MATLAB. Act Trigger a reaction. ThingSpeak Features Collect data in private channels Share data with public channels RESTful and MQTT APIs MATLAB® analytics and visualizations Event scheduling Alerts App integrations Works With MATLAB® & Simulink® Arduino® Particle devices ESP8266 and ESP32 Wifi Modules Raspberry Pi™ LoRaWAN® Things Network Senet Libelium Beckhoff Featured Projects and Customer Stories Energy Data Analysis Cadmus used MATLAB and ThingSpeak to deploy a system of cloud-connected sensors for the near-real-time measurement and analysis of energy data. The system uses off-the-shelf hardware to monitor and analyze loads of HVAC systems and large appliances. Tide Prediction This project shows how to prototype and deploy an IoT system with data analytics without developing custom web software.  Specifically, a tidal forecasting system that uses neural networks to predict the effect of wind on water levels is described. Traffic Monitor This project shows how to build a traffic monitor with a Raspberry Pi and a webcam.  Simulink is used to design and deploy an algorithm onto the Raspberry Pi that calculates the density of cars on a busy highway.  The traffic information is sent to ThingSpeak, and MATLAB is used to analyze and visualize the traffic patterns. Weather Station This project shows how to build an Arduino-based weather station that sends data to ThingSpeak.  Once the data is collected, MATLAB is used to view trends of the data, plot histograms of the data, calculate dew point from the raw temperature and humidity data, and create custom visualizations.
