Community-Driven Content Selection

Unlike other platforms, WTR-Lab doesn't dictate what novels you read. Our community drives the content! Users can request novels from supported raw websites, vote on their favorite requests, or use tickets to fast-release popular titles. You decide what gets translated next. This community-driven approach ensures that the content reflects what readers actually want to read, not what a moderator decides for you.

AI-Powered Translation Technology

We utilize cutting-edge AI models like Gemini 2.5 Flash to translate novels to English with unprecedented quality. For maximum flexibility, we also support older translation options like Google Translate, Bing Translate and Yandex Translate, allowing you to translate from either our AI-translated English version or the original Chinese text to your preferred language. Most Chinese novels don't have official human-translated versions for Western audiences, so we provide a platform for high-quality machine translation using the latest AI technology.
