Tesla Could Be Planning to Support Apple Car Keys
Sunday December 28, 2025 4:24 am PST by Hartley Charlton

Support for Apple Car Keys may now be more likely to come to Tesla vehicles, amid new evidence that the automaker is embracing native, system-level digital car keys.


According to Not a Tesla App, 4.52.0 of Tesla's mobile app contains multiple code references to Harmony Wallet Key Cards. The discovery is notable because it represents a shift in how Tesla appears to be approaching mobile device integration.

Tesla's current Phone Key relies on Bluetooth communication between the vehicle and the Tesla app running in the background on a smartphone. By contrast, a native wallet key is stored at the operating system level and uses secure hardware elements, often making it more reliable and accessible.

The code strings identified in Tesla app version 4.52.0 specifically reference integration with Huawei's HarmonyOS, suggesting that the initial implementation is designed for Huawei Wallet on HarmonyOS devices. HarmonyOS is widely used in China, where Huawei is a dominant presence in the smartphone market. Tesla has historically used the Chinese market as a testing ground for new software capabilities before expanding them globally.

Although the references do not mention Apple Wallet or Google Wallet, the underlying functionality closely mirrors how Apple implements native digital car keys on the iPhone. Apple introduced Car Key support in Apple Wallet in 2020, allowing compatible vehicles to be unlocked, locked, and started using NFC, Bluetooth, or ultra wideband. ‌Car Keys‌ are stored in the Secure Enclave on the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch, enabling features such as Express Mode, which allows a vehicle to be unlocked without Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, and even functionality even when the device battery is almost totally depleted.

Earlier this month, Rivian announced native support for Apple Wallet and Google Wallet digital car keys as part of its 2025.46 software update. In recent weeks, Porsche, Toyota, and General Motors all appear to be following suit.

Apple Tested AirPods in Bright Colors
Saturday December 27, 2025 6:06 am PST by Hartley Charlton

Apple reportedly tested a version of the first-generation AirPods with bright, iPhone 5c-like colored charging cases.


The images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "Kosutami," claim to show first-generation AirPods prototypes with pink and yellow exterior casings. The interior of the charging case and the earbuds themselves remain white.

They seem close to some of the color options offered for the ‌iPhone‌ 5c, which came in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. Apple has only ever released AirPods in white.

Christmas post Abandoned iPhone 5c colored AirPods 1st gen prototype. #appleinternal pic.twitter.com/Y2wzZTxgLC — Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) December 24, 2025

In 2023, Kosutami shared images of AirPods in pink. Apple apparently developed five different color options for AirPods to approximately match the ‌iPhone‌ 7, but decided not to move forward with the idea.

Some users have sought after AirPods in different color options for several years. While Apple was seemingly only ever considering offering the charging case in different color ways, it is interesting to know that the company got as far as prototyping distinct color options for the device to match various ‌iPhone‌ models. Today, the AirPods Max are the only AirPods to have been offered in different color options.

Kosutami previously shared images of various Apple prototypes, including all-black Vision Pro parts, an earlier version of the MagSafe charging puck, FineWoven Apple Watch bands, a functional AirPower charging mat, an unreleased "Magic Charger" accessory, and more.

Top Stories: iPhone Fold Mockup, Where's the New Apple TV?, and More
Saturday December 27, 2025 6:00 am PST by MacRumors Staff

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from MacRumors! News in the Apple world has unsurprisingly been relatively slow over the past week, but Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone managed to make its way back into the news, while we also shared updates on current and future Apple TV news.


iOS 26.3 will be bringing some new features, particularly for users in the EU, so we'll look for additional betas and eventually a public release once the new year rolls around, and read on below for all the details on these stories and more!


Top Stories
Why Apple's Foldable iPhone May Be Smaller Than Expected

Apple's first foldable iPhone, rumored for release next year, may turn out to be smaller than most people imagine, if a recent report and new mockups are anything to go by.


Based on The Information's recent report that the foldable iPhone will feature a 5.3-inch external display and a 7.7-inch internal display when unfolded, designer Ben Geskin mocked up a physical representation of what such a device might look like in the hand, and it's actually remarkably compact with a form factor very similar to a passport book.

Apple is reportedly still testing next-generation ultra-thin flexible glass for the device's interior display, seeking to find the best solution to make the crease down the middle essentially invisible.


Where's the New Apple TV?

Apple hasn't updated the Apple TV 4K since 2022, and 2025 was supposed to be the year that we got a refresh. There were rumors suggesting Apple would release the new ‌Apple TV‌ before the end of 2025, but it's clear that's not going to happen now.


It's not clear what happened, but it's possible Apple decided to hold all home-related product announcements until spring 2026, when the smarter, more capable version of Siri will be ready in iOS 26.4.

In the meantime, check out our video recapping what we might see in the next-generation Apple TV.


Turn Off the User Profiles Screen on Apple TV 4K

Some current Apple TV users have been annoyed by the new profile selection screen that appears every time you wake the device. While it's a handy feature for multi-user households, there are plenty of households that want to use their Apple TVs under only a single profile, so the selection screen is simply a nuisance.


Fortunately, there's a relatively easy way to turn off the profile selection screen if you know to look for it.


iOS 26.3 Brings AirPods-Like Pairing to Third-Party Devices in EU Under DMA

Apple is continuing to increase interoperability support in its products for users in the European Union due to the Digital Markets Act, and the EU is once again crediting the DMA for new expansions coming in iOS 26.3.


Third-party devices like earbuds will be able to seamlessly pair with iOS devices similar to how AirPods and Beats products already work, by simply bringing the accessory close to the device to bring up a simple one-step pairing process.

Users in the EU will also see expanded notifications support for third-party accessories like smartwatches, allowing users to view and interact with incoming iOS notifications on a third-party device as they can already do on an Apple Watch.


Apple Hit With Supersized Fine in Italy Over an iPhone Privacy Feature

Italy's Competition Authority (AGCM) has imposed a €98.6 million ($116 million) fine on Apple over its App Tracking Transparency feature.


Since the release of iOS 14.5 in April 2021, Apple has required apps to ask for permission before tracking a user's activity across other apps and websites for personalized advertising, as part of a feature named App Tracking Transparency. If a user selects the "Ask App Not to Track" option, the app is unable to access the device's advertising identifier.

In a press release and executive summary this week, the AGCM said the App Tracking Transparency rules are "disproportionate," and "harmful" to app developers and advertisers. Ultimately, it found that Apple abused its dominant position in the EU market.


iPhone 18 Trial Production to Start in February Ahead of Spring 2027 Launch

Apple is reportedly already preparing to begin trial production of the iPhone 18 series after Chinese New Year, according to Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital.


The claim suggests small-scale manufacturing runs will start once factories return to normal operations following the Lunar New Year shutdown, which typically ends in late February.

The Chinese leaker claims that production lines for the iPhone 18 Pro models have already been set up, indicating that the Pro hardware design has already been locked in. Multiple sources have reported that Apple will move to a split-release strategy, with the Pro and Fold models debuting in the usual fall time frame while the standard iPhone 18 won't be released until spring 2027 alongside an iPhone 18e and potentially an iPhone Air 2.

What You Can (and Can't) Use an Apple Gift Card For
Thursday December 25, 2025 2:30 am PST by Hartley Charlton

Apple Gift Cards are one of the most common Apple-related gifts given during the holidays, so if you've received one today, here are all of the things you can and cannot use it for.


After redeeming an Apple Gift Card, the value is added to the Apple Account balance and automatically applies at checkout when making eligible purchases. It can be spent on a wide range of Apple products, services, and digital content.

Apple Gift Cards are marketed as a single, flexible balance that works across Apple's ecosystem, but there are clear limits on what they can and cannot be used for once redeemed to an Apple Account.


What Apple Gift Cards Can Be Used For
Purchasing Apple hardware and accessories on apple.com, in the Apple Store app, or in an Apple retail store.
Using the balance toward Apple hardware when checking out, with any remaining cost paid using another payment method.
Buying apps and games on the App Store, including in-app purchases.
Paying for digital media, including movies, TV shows, and books through Apple's digital storefronts.
Covering subscriptions to Apple services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud+ storage, as well as eligible third-party app subscriptions billed through the ‌App Store‌.
What Apple Gift Cards Can't Be Used For
Making purchases outside Apple's ecosystem, such as goods or services from non-Apple retailers.
Starting certain recurring payments, such as AppleCare+ plans, without an additional credit or debit card on file.
Redeeming or using balances across different countries or regions, as gift cards are typically region-locked.
Transferring to or purchasing other gift cards.
Exchanging for cash or cash equivalents.

While Apple Gift Cards are intentionally designed to be more versatile than older ‌App Store‌ or ‌Apple Store‌–only gift cards, they still come with some limits. For users, the key distinction is that Apple Gift Cards work best for Apple-direct purchases and subscriptions, but they can't replace a traditional payment method for gifting or non-Apple spending.

Apple CEO Tim Cook Buys $3 Million of Nike Shares
Wednesday December 24, 2025 8:41 am PST by Hartley Charlton

Apple CEO Tim Cook disclosed a roughly $3 million open-market purchase of Nike shares this week (via Reuters).


According to a regulatory filing published yesterday, Cook purchased 50,000 Class B shares of Nike on December 22 at an average price of $58.97 per share, for a total investment of approximately $2.95 million. The filing shows that Cook now holds about 105,000 Nike shares, a position valued at nearly $6 million.

Nike shares rose following the disclosure, gaining between about 2% and 5% in premarket and early regular-session activity, after the stock had fallen sharply in the days following the company's most recent earnings report, which highlighted ongoing challenges in its business, particularly in China. Nike is currently in the early stages of a turnaround effort under CEO Elliott Hill, who returned to the company last year after retiring.

Cook has served on Nike's board of directors since 2005 and is its lead independent director, a role he assumed in 2016 after Nike co-founder Phil Knight stepped down as chairman. In addition to his position at Apple, Cook also chairs Nike's compensation committee, placing him in a central governance role at the apparel maker. The December 22 transaction represents Cook's largest open-market purchase of Nike shares in years and comes at a time when the company is under pressure from investors following a prolonged decline in its stock price.

Apple Plans to Expand iPhone Driver's Licenses to These 7 U.S. States
Wednesday December 24, 2025 8:40 am PST by Joe Rossignol

In select U.S. states, residents can add their driver's license or state ID to the Apple Wallet app on the iPhone and Apple Watch, and then use it to display proof of identity or age at select airports and businesses, and in select apps.


The feature is currently available in 13 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, and it is expected to launch in at least seven more in the future.

To set up the feature, open the Wallet app and tap on the plus sign in the top-right corner. Next, select Driver's License and ID Cards and follow the steps.


Supported States

The following 13 states offer driver's licenses in the Wallet app:

Arizona (since March 2022)
Maryland (since May 2022)
Colorado (since November 2022)
Georgia (since May 2023)
Ohio (since July 2024)
Hawaii (since August 2024)
California (since September 2024)
Iowa (since October 2024)
New Mexico (since December 2024)
Montana (since August 2025)
North Dakota (since September 2025)
West Virginia (since October 2025)
Illinois (since November 2025)

The feature is also available in Puerto Rico.


Future States

Apple and local DMV offices have announced that the following U.S. states have signed on to adopt the feature, but no timeframes were disclosed:

Connecticut
Kentucky
Mississippi
Oklahoma
Utah
Arkansas
Virginia
Participating Airports

Apple Wallet IDs are accepted at TSA checkpoints in more than 250 airports in the U.S., for domestic travel. Given that Apple Wallet IDs are not accepted by law enforcement, and lack many other use cases, carrying a physical ID is still necessary.

Here are just some of the airports that offer the feature — there are hundreds of others:

Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)
Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)
Denver International Airport (DEN)
Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG)
John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH)
San Francisco International Airport (SFO)
San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC)
Los Angeles International (LAX)
Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)
Des Moines International Airport (DSM)
Eastern Iowa Airport (CID)
Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ)
Lea County Regional Airport (HOB)
Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU)
Billings Logan International Airport (BIL)
Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport (BZN)
Great Falls International Airport (GTF)
Missoula International Airport (MSO)
Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)
Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW)
St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL)
Richmond International Airport (RIC)
Norfolk International Airport (ORF)
Roanoke-Blacksburg Regional Airport (ROA)
Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport (PHF)

Travelers should refer to TSA signage to confirm availability of the feature.


Digital Passport


If you live in a state that does not yet offer Apple Wallet IDs, you can now create a Digital ID based on your U.S. passport, and present it at the same participating TSA checkpoints, for age and identity verification purposes during domestic travel. It is not a replacement for a physical passport, and it cannot be used for international travel.

Apple to Introduce New App Store Fee Structure in Brazil Following Antitrust Settlement
Wednesday December 24, 2025 8:15 am PST by Hartley Charlton

Brazilian regulators have approved a settlement that will require Apple to change how the App Store operates on iPhone in the country, including allowing alternative app stores, expanded payment options, and a defined new fee structure.


In a press release, Brazil's Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE), said its court has approved a Term of Commitment to Cease proposed by Apple to resolve an investigation into the company's ‌App Store‌ rules on iOS. The case began in 2022 and examined whether Apple's restrictions on app distribution and payments limited competition in Brazil.

CADE said the investigation focused on Apple's prohibition of third-party app stores on iOS, the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system for digital goods and subscriptions, and restrictions that prevented developers from informing users about alternative payment options.

Under the settlement, Apple will be required to allow developers in Brazil to link to external payment options and promote offers that take place outside their apps. Developers will also be permitted to offer third-party payment methods within their apps alongside Apple's own in-app purchase system, with CADE requiring that these options be presented next to Apple's payment option.

Apple will also have to allow third-party app stores in Brazil. CADE specified that Apple may still display warnings or informational messages to users, but those messages must be neutral, objective, and limited in scope, and must not introduce extra steps or barriers that make alternative options harder to use.

According to Brazilian technology site Tecnoblog, which said it obtained the details directly from CADE, purchases made through the ‌App Store‌ will remain subject to a 10% or 25% commission under standard terms. Developers who use Apple's payment system would also pay a 5% transaction fee.

If an app directs users to pay outside the app using only static text, with no clickable link or button, Apple will not charge a fee. If the app includes a clickable button or link that sends users to an external website for payment, Apple will charge a 15% fee. Third-party app stores will be subject to a 5% Core Technology Commission.

CADE said Apple will have up to 105 days to implement the required changes once the new rules become binding.

Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts.

iPhone Air 2 Could Still Launch Next Year
Wednesday December 24, 2025 7:25 am PST by Hartley Charlton

Apple's next-generation iPhone Air could still launch in the fall of 2026, according to the Weibo leaker known as "Fixed Focus Digital."


The leaker claims to have been told by sources that the second-generation ‌iPhone Air‌ will launch in the fall. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17e is said to already be in mass production ahead of unveiling at a spring product launch event.

The rumor comes in contrast to an array of corroborated reports that the second-generation ‌iPhone Air‌ has been delayed until March 2027, where it is expected to launch alongside the standard iPhone 18 and a lower-end ‌iPhone‌ 18e. The second-generation ‌iPhone Air‌ was originally rumored to launch alongside the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro, ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max, and foldable ‌iPhone‌ in the fall of 2026, but poor sales of the debut model apparently led Apple to delay the launch.

The second-generation ‌iPhone Air‌ is rumored to address complaints about the device by adding a second rear camera and lowering its price. A lighter weight, vapor chamber cooling, and a larger battery capacity are also among the rumored new features.

It is still possible that a new ‌iPhone Air‌ could launch in the fall of next year, especially if Apple has expedited development of new features, since this was the original scheduled launch time frame. Nevertheless, it would be surprising if the multitude of rumors indicating a delayed launch were mistaken.

Apple Discontinued These 25 Products This Year
Wednesday December 24, 2025 7:24 am PST by Joe Rossignol

With the end of 2025 near, the time has come to look back at the devices and accessories that Apple discontinued throughout the year.


Most of the products that were discontinued this year were simply replaced by a new model with an updated chip. However, the iPhone SE line was entirely discontinued when the iPhone 16e launched, and the iPhone Plus line is being phased out.

Below, we have listed 25 products that were discontinued by Apple this year.


iPhones

Apple discontinued the third-generation iPhone SE in February, after introducing the iPhone 16e. As a result, Apple no longer sells any iPhone models with a Home button, Touch ID, LCD screen, a sub-6-inch screen size, or Lightning.

The original iPhone SE was released in March 2016. That model's design was largely based on the iPhone 5s, with key specs including a 4-inch display, a Touch ID home button, and an aluminum and glass frame with chamfered edges. However, the device was powered by a newer A9 chip from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.

Apple went on to release two more iPhone SE models in 2020 and 2022, respectively, with those devices having a similar design as the iPhone 8.

Meanwhile, the iPhone Plus has effectively been replaced by the ultra-thin iPhone Air in Apple's smartphone lineup. Both the iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 15 Plus were discontinued this year, and it is only a matter of time before the iPhone 16 Plus is axed too. Apple is not expected to release another Plus model in the foreseeable future.

Here are all of the iPhone models that were discontinued this year:

iPhone 16 Pro Max (succeeded by iPhone 17 Pro Max)
iPhone 16 Pro (succeeded by iPhone 17 Pro)
iPhone 15 Plus
iPhone 15
iPhone 14 Plus
iPhone 14
iPhone SE (succeeded by iPhone 16e)
iPads


It was a spec-bump year for the iPad lineup, with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and entry-level iPad all receiving faster chips, but no major design changes.

Here are all of the iPad models that were discontinued this year:

iPad Pro with M4 chip (updated with M5 chip)
iPad Air with M2 chip (updated with M3 chip)
iPad 10 (updated with A16 chip)
Apple Watches


Apple Watch Series 11 is a very minor upgrade over the now-discontinued Series 10, but the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch SE 3 offer some more meaningful changes. None of the latest Apple Watch models received a new chip, though.

Here are all of the Apple Watch models that were discontinued this year:

Apple Watch Ultra 2 (succeeded by Apple Watch Ultra 3)
Apple Watch Series 10 (succeeded by Apple Watch Series 11)
Apple Watch SE 2 (succeeded by Apple Watch SE 3)
Macs


Here are all of the Mac models that were discontinued this year:

Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips (updated with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips)
14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 chip (updated with M5 chip)
13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip (updated with M4 chip)
13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip
Other


Here are other Apple products and accessories that were discontinued this year:

AirPods Pro 2 (succeeded by AirPods Pro 3)
Apple Vision Pro with M2 chip (updated with M5 chip)
MagSafe Charger with Qi 2 (succeeded by MagSafe Charger with Qi 2.2 support)
30W USB-C Power Adapter (succeeded by 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max)*
Lightning to 3.5mm Audio Cable (succeeded by USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Cable)
MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Converter

* In the U.S., U.K., Canada, Japan, and select other countries only.

Advanced iPhone 18 Camera Sensor to Be Made in Texas
Wednesday December 24, 2025 5:37 am PST by Hartley Charlton

Samsung is preparing to supply Apple with advanced image sensors for the iPhone in Austin, Texas, according to The Elec.


The sensors will reportedly be made by Samsung at its existing facility in Austin. The company is expected to install production equipment for the project in the near future and has posted job listings for mechanical and electrical technicians, engineers, and managers to work on set up.

Samsung is expected to make the ‌iPhone‌'s image sensor with a three-stack design, which enables higher pixel density and improved low-light performance by vertically stacking multiple sensor layers. Stacked sensor architecture also allows for faster readout speeds, reduced power consumption, and higher dynamic range. This manufacturing process has not previously been deployed at a commercial scale.

Earlier this month, Samsung notified the city of council of Austin of its intention to spend $19 billion on its Austin facility. The new image sensor production line is expected to begin operation in March at the earliest.

The new sensor is believed to be destined for the iPhone 18, which is expected to launch in the first half of 2027. Apple reportedly reached a deal with Samsung in August for supply of the component.

This will be the first time Apple will move away from Sony as the sole supplier for ‌‌iPhone‌‌ image sensors and make the component in the United States. Today, Sony is the sole supplier of ‌‌iPhone‌‌ image sensors; they are produced in Japan and delivered via TSMC.

Wednesday December 24, 2025 4:00 am PST by Tim Hardwick

Have you been good this year? If so, you may be interested to know that Google has launched its annual Santa tracking feature, allowing Santa to be tracked in real time on his journey to the North Pole as he prepares to deliver presents to children around the world.


Google's Santa Tracker continues a two-decade tradition for the company, allowing excited children (and grown-ups!) to keep up with the jolly gift-giver's travels throughout December 24. On this day, Santa's Village transforms into a tracking experience where children can follow Santa and his reindeer as they merrily go about their important work.

Santa can be tracked using a web browser on iPhone, iPad, or Mac by visiting Google's official Santa Tracking website. The site features a live map of Santa's current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his journey, and the estimated time that he will arrive in each specific location.

The Santa site provides pictures of locations that Santa has already visited, a live count of gifts that have been delivered, and Santa's current distance from your location. There are also a selection of games to play, creative things to do, and videos to watch.

Other Santa tracking services are also available, such as the NORAD Tracks Santa Claus app and website, but Google's site is often the most interactive and detailed. Happy holidays!

Have a 3D Printer? You Can Make Your Own iPhone Fold Dummy
Tuesday December 23, 2025 1:31 pm PST by Juli Clover

Apple is working on a foldable iPhone that's set to come out in September 2026, and rumors suggest that it will have a display that's around 5.4 inches when closed and 7.6 inches when open. Exact measurements vary based on rumors, but one 3D designer has created a mockup based on what we've heard so far.


On MakerWorld, a user named Subsy has uploaded a 1:1 ‌iPhone‌ Fold replica (via Macworld), which can be 3D printed to give you a rough idea of the size of the upcoming foldable ‌iPhone‌.

Subsy claims that the model is "based on recently leaked CAD drawings of the ‌iPhone‌ Fold," but there haven't been actual CAD leaks to our knowledge. There were reports of CAD drawings earlier this month, but it turns out those drawings were concept drawings and renders created by MacRumors reader iZac back in May.

iZac designed a mockup with a 5.5-inch display when the device is closed, and 7.76 inches when open. That's in line with the multiple rumors that we've heard, but so far, we don't have exact dimensions.

While you can now print a 3D mockup of iZac's concept, the design isn't based on an actual CAD render. It's likely somewhat similar to what the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will look like in terms of size, but Apple's design for the cameras and the hinge will probably differ quite a bit.

If you have a 3D printer, it's a useful way to get something that's close to the size of the ‌iPhone‌ Fold so you can see how it compares to your existing ‌iPhone‌. We'll likely see more accurate CAD renders and dummy models starting to surface in the first months of 2026.

Texas App Store Age Verification Law Blocked by Federal Judge
Tuesday December 23, 2025 12:36 pm PST by Juli Clover

A Texas federal judge today blocked an App Store age verification law that was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026, which means Apple may not have to support the changes after all.


The Texas ‌App Store‌ Accountability Act (SB2420) requires Apple and other app marketplaces to confirm user age when a person creates an Apple Account. Apple Accounts for users under 18 would need to join a Family Sharing group, with new controls available for parents and restrictions for minors.

In a preliminary injunction that delays the implementation of the act, Judge Robert Pitman said that it violates the First Amendment and is "more likely than not unconstitutional."


The Act is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book. As set out below, the Court finds a likelihood that, when considered on the merits, SB 2420 violates the First Amendment.

The injunction was in response to a motion filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a group that includes Apple and Google. Today's decision is a win for Apple, as Apple has been fighting against age assurance requirements in Texas and other states. Apple says that the Texas law impacts user privacy.


While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.

The court will move on to determining whether the law is facially invalid, which would mean that it is unconstitutional and will be entirely thrown out.

Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts.

Samsung Developing 'Wide Fold' With iPhone Fold-Like Design Ahead of Apple's 2026 Launch
Tuesday December 23, 2025 11:55 am PST by Juli Clover

Samsung is working on a new foldable smartphone that's wider and shorter than the models that it's released before, according to Korean news site ETNews. The "Wide Fold" will compete with Apple's iPhone Fold that's set to launch in September 2026.


Samsung's existing Galaxy Z Fold7 display is 6.5 inches when closed, and 8 inches when open, with a 21:9 aspect ratio when folded and a 20:18 aspect ratio when open. Samsung has used a similar size for its prior Z Fold devices.

Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone‌ Fold's display will measure in at 5.3 to 5.5 inches when closed, and 7.5 to 7.8 inches when open (rumors vary). It's squatter and wider than Samsung's taller, narrower design, with a 4:3 aspect ratio when open.

Samsung's "Wide Fold" will coincidentally feature a 7.6-inch display when open, and a 5.4-inch display when closed. It's also expected to have a 4:3 aspect ratio, making it noticeably different than prior models because of the more square shape.

The wider 4:3 aspect ratio is expected to be more comfortable to hold than a taller device, similar to a notebook.

ETNews says that Samsung plans to release its wider foldable device in the fall of 2026, which is also when the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will be coming out. The wide fold will join the next-generation Galaxy Fold for a total of two "Fold" devices, plus there will be a flip device.
