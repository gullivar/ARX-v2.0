Where is my Train? Where is my Train? from We created the “Where is my train” app with the mission to use technology to improve the
lives of millions of Indian train travellers. Over time, we’ve improved the app to make
it even more convenient and useful, and we’re thrilled with the response that we’ve gotten
from users. The confidence that our users have placed in us is what makes us so excited to
think even bigger. That’s why we’re excited to share that Sigmoid Labs, the team behind the “Where is my train”
app, is joining Google. We can think of no better place to help us achieve our mission,
and we’re excited to join Google to help bring technology and information into more people’s
hands. We are really grateful for the support and love you have shown us so far.
We are short of words to thank you at this moment.
Thank you to all of our users and supporters along the way! — Team Wimt Search your Train Pick your Train Spot your Train Know your Train Delay Terms of Use
