Turncoat antibodies unmasked in a model of autoimmune demyelination: From biology to therapy
By exploring the antibody response in mouse models of autoimmune demyelinating diseases, this study has led to a promising treatment to neutralize the harmful antibodies in human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD). ...Autoantibodies contribute to many autoimmune diseases, yet there is no approved therapy to neutralize them selectively. A popular mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), could serve to develop such a therapy, provided we can better ...

Medial entorhinal VIP-expressing interneurons receive input from the thalamic anterior dorsal nucleus and are critical for spatial memory
Interneurons are classically viewed as essential components in the maintenance and regulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in local neuronal networks. Nevertheless, recent studies have shed new light on vasoactive intestinal peptide ...Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) cells have emerged as a crucial component of the inhibitory network, facilitating interregional communication, particularly in the context of associative memory. To expand our current understanding of the role of this ...

Tattoo ink induces inflammation in the draining lymph node and alters the immune response to vaccination
In this study, we characterized the immune responses to the tattoo ink accumulating in the lymph nodes (LNs). This is very relevant as tattoo ink commonly reaches and persists in this organ in most tattooed subjects, often lifelong. We have ...Despite safety concerns regarding the toxicity of tattoo ink, no studies have reported the consequences of tattooing on the immune response. In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic ...

Evolved birth physiology meets modern birth practice: Sustained effects of planned cesarean delivery on child hair cortisol in Brazil
During labor, babies are exposed to mechanical forces and hormones that help prepare them for life outside the womb. Using data from a large sample of 4 to 7 y old children from Brazil, we found that those born by planned cesarean section had ...Cesarean section (CS) is the most common major surgery worldwide and, by enabling birth outside physiologic labor, is an evolutionary novelty. Labor-related mechanical and hormonal stimuli, shaped by natural selection, facilitate neonatal adaptation to ...
