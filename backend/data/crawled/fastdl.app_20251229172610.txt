What exactly is FastDl.app?
FastDl.app is a browser-based helper that lets you save public Instagram content - videos, photos, Reels, Stories, IGTV and carousels - to your own device for offline viewing. It works straight from the website; no software install is required.
Is downloading from Instagram legal?
Saving public posts for personal use is generally allowed, but copyright always belongs to the creator. Please keep the files private unless you have the owner’s permission to share or reuse them.
What formats and quality do you offer?
Photos arrive as JPG (up to 1080 × 1350 px - the platform’s own limit). Videos save as MP4, typically in HD 720p if the source was uploaded in that quality. No watermarks are added.
Do I need to log in or create an account?
No. Just paste the Instagram link - there’s no registration, no Instagram credentials, and no cookies that track you across the web.
Are there any limits on daily downloads?
None at all. Download one item or a hundred - our servers don’t impose caps.

Can I grab content from private accounts?
Sorry, no. We respect user privacy, so only public posts are accessible. If you can’t view the post in a logged-out browser tab, FastDl.app can’t fetch it either.
Which devices and browsers are supported?
Any modern browser on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS or even ChromeOS. Tested in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, Opera and Brave - both desktop and mobile versions.
Where do the files go on my phone or computer?
On desktop they land in your default “Downloads” folder. On mobile you can find them in the browser’s downloads list or the “Files” app. Most gallery apps will index them automatically.
Is my link history stored on your servers?
No. Links are processed in real time; once the download link is generated and delivered, both the original URL and the converted file are wiped from our cache.
Why might the speed drop?
A slow network, heavy ISP throttling or Instagram rate-limits can reduce throughput. Switching to another Wi-Fi, disabling a VPN, or trying a different browser usually fixes it. If not, reach out through the contact page - we answer fast.
