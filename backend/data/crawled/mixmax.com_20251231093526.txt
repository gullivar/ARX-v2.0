Mixmax is an AI-native Sales Execution Platform. It eliminates overwhelm by helping reps identify, prioritize, and execute the most impactful next steps so deals keep moving forward. Unlike legacy tools, Mixmax helps sellers focus on the right actions that actually move the needle by identifying the signals that matter most and taking the best next steps. Who uses Mixmax? Mixmax is for sellers who feel overwhelmed.  Anyone who runs a sales process - sales, customer success, recruiting, fund raising, professional services, real-estate, insurance, etc. -  can use the power of Mixmax to keep their deals moving forward smoothly. Do I need to install anything to use Mixmax? Yes, you only need to install the inbox extension for Gmail or Outlook.  From there, you can use Mixmax Copilots from directly inside your inbox. What’s included in the trial? All Mixmax users start with a 14-day trial of the Mixmax bundle, which includes all three Copilots:  Inbox, Meeting and Engagement Copilot.  There is no credit card required during the trial period.  At the end of your trial, you can pay to stay on the Mixmax bundle, or select individual Copilots.  If you do not upgrade to any of these options, your account will be automatically converted to Mixmax Free. Do I need technical help to get started? Mixmax is designed to be easy to set up, and even easier to use.  You generally will not need technical help to get started.  Simply sign up and install the inbox extension.   Some users need technical help connecting Mixmax to their CRM, depending on their company's security policies and permissions. Can I customize Mixmax to fit my workflow? Yes.   Every seller has different needs and processes.   Mixmax can be customized to fit those specific needs.  Start with your selection of Copilots.  Go with the bundle (all three copilots), or select Copilots individually.  You can also add custom branding, or a dialer based on your needs. Is Mixmax only for closing deals? Mixmax is for sellers who want to master the most important part of sales...the art of the follow-up.  This applies to the entire sales process, from prospecting new accounts, to working in-process deals, to managing existing customer relationships. Do you offer support during the trial? Yes.
