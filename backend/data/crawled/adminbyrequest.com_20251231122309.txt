Book a Demo Download People we've helped Here's what they're saying "Admin By Request made it easy for us to take control over the users’ needs for administrative access on their computers. We now have full control over what is actually installed, and over the admin tasks being performed. The users are only admins when they need to be – it all works great!" Afa Insurance | Sweden "Excellent support. The issue was identified and while a solution was being worked on we workshopped various workarounds to remediate the problem. When the problem was solved the product was updated with the fix and we were offered early access to the update." Soeren Hermansen | Chr. Hansen | Denmark "It is refreshing to get immediate response and excellent follow-up, even for a feature request that is to happen some time in the future. I was expecting vaporware, and within less than 2 weeks, the add role-based permission for the new Break Glass feature was available. I am sure others requested prior to my inquiry, but the key is support did not just close the ticket like some of the support organizations that fault staff for not resolving in minutes. This was a big plus in our purchase decision and even after the purchase, support is still above comparison." Geoff Pickard | Westat | USA "I’m very happy with Admin By Request in all regards. The product is rock solid and takes on a complex task and manages it with bravura. The simplicity was the major reason for not choosing 
another vendor. The support has 
been very fast in responding to 
questions and the response has 
always been of a high technical 
quality." Sebastian Morsoney | ESIS | Denmark "Very flexible and powerful tool for managing what users are installing and controlling what could be done." Svetolav Bakalov | Tek Experts | Costa Rica "I have been using Admin By Request for several years now and I love the program. They are by far the best tech support I have had the pleasure to work with and I have been an IT Manager for Almco Steel Products for 28 years now. By far the best purchase." Tom Schmidt | Almco Steel | USA "Admin by request has made our IT delivery more secure as we now have control over when and why administrative rights are needed. Everything is logged in an 
easy-to-use web interface, and we 
no longer have lots of local 
administrators that we can’t keep 
track of." Coop | Sweden "Great product and excellent, clear support. The SMEs are always willing to listen to feedback with a view of continuous improvement." Kevin Van Zyl | Wunderman Thompson | USA "Admin By Request has been a lifesaver for Muskelsvindsfonden. You really want IT to work perfectly and be secure when you have people working oﬀ-site under tight 
deadlines, with thousands of 
attendees waiting for concerts to 
begin! Admin By Request is 
something we cannot do without in 
our day-to-day business." Poul Vels | Muskelsvindfonden | Denmark "One of the best developed products I've seen for a long time. Very intuitive, feature rich and so simple. Incredibly responsive and helpful support." Graham Pettett | Informa | UK "Seriously the best support I have encountered so far. Response times are unbelievable and issues are comprehended very quickly. Offered solutions are always very customer-oriented. You get the feeling the support knows their product very well. Thank you."
