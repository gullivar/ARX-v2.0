When you shop at an independently owned business, your entire community benefits: The Economy Spend $100 at a local-owned business and $52 of that stays in your community. Spend $50 at a national chain and keep $6.50 in the local community. Spend $50 online with a remote vendor with no sales tax collected and keep not one penny in your local community. Local businesses create higher-paying jobs for our neighbors. More of your taxes are reinvested in your community--where they belong. The Environment Buying local means less packaging, less transportation, and a smaller carbon footprint. Shopping in a local business district means less infrastructure, less maintenance, and more money to beautify your community. The Community Local retailers are your friends and neighbors—support them and they’ll support you. Local businesses donate to charities at more than twice the rate of national chains. More independents means more choice, more diversity, and a truly unique community. Now is the time to stand up and join your fellow individuals in the IndieBound mission supporting local businesses and celebrating independents. Learn more about IndieBound. Your choices matter. When you shop at small businesses, you help your community, the environment, and the economy. Find your local indie bookstore.
