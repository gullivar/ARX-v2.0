Today's Weather Outlook

Old Man Winter delivers plenty of cold and snow to the eastern third of the U.S. on Tuesday, while a drier and milder pattern is expected elsewhere.

One weakening low pressure system will drift into Atlantic Canada on Tuesday, while a clipper-type system drops out of south-central Canada. Rounds of light to briefly moderate snow will be found throughout the day in the eastern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley into Appalachia and interior portions of the Northeast. Snow will develop in the morning across the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, which will spread to the Great Lakes in the afternoon and evening.

While generally light accumulations are expected, there will be some snow that is enhanced by lake effect, so locally heavier snow will be possible depending on the exact wind direction. Some areas in western and upstate New York could see over a foot of snow! With cold temperatures also in place, any snow that does fall could easily accumulate on roads, making for a slippery commute. Winds will also remain breezy to strong along the Appalachian Spine into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

On the opposite side of the nation, a low-pressure system in the Pacific Ocean will approach southern California throughout the day. There could be a few sprinkles or very light showers from San Diego and Los Angeles northward to the San Francisco Bay area late tonight.

Otherwise, high pressure will control the weather throughout the rest of the nation. Expect dry and quiet weather for the rest of the Western U.S., the central and southern Plains, and the Southeast.

Cold, below-normal temperatures will be found in the northern Plains, Great Lakes, and the rest of the Eastern U.S., while unseasonably mild weather is in the forecast elsewhere.

Expect single digits and teens for the northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes. However, a few spots close to the U.S.-Canada border will remain below zero. Far interior portions of the Northeast will also see single digits and teens. Twenties and 30s are expected for the Ohio Valley, northern Mid-Atlantic, and southern New England, as well as the tallest portions of the Mountain West.

Forties and 50s will be most common throughout the U.S., including the Northwest, most of California, and the rest of the Mountain West into the central Plains, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast. Even parts of northern Florida will only see the mercury climb into the 50s. Sixties and a few lower 70s cover southern California and the Desert Southwest, the southern Plains, and far southern Florida.
