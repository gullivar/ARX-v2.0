Near-zero CVE images, now accessible to everyone
Open-source, Apache 2.0–licensed images built for trust while delivering near-zero CVEs, complete SBOMs, and SLSA Level 3 provenance. Upgrade to DHI Enterprise for SLAs, customization, and compliance, with extended lifecycle support for EOL images available as an add-on.

Apache 2.0 freedom

Docker Hardened Images are fully open source and free to use, share, and build on, with no licensing surprises and complete transparency.

Minimal and distroless images

Ultra-minimal distroless Debian and Alpine images that remove everything you don’t need, shrinking footprint and attack surface by up to 97%.

Up to 95% CVE reduction

Eliminate vulnerabilities before they reach production with continuously rebuilt images from Docker’s hardened pipeline and verified SBOMs.

Extended Lifecycle Support for long-term protection

Add-on protection after upstream support ends, with multi-year CVE patches, updated SBOMs, and verifiable provenance that eliminate long windows of unpatched risk.

Start secure, customize easily

Add your own tools, packages, certificates, or settings while inheriting Docker’s hardened pipeline, signed builds, and secure defaults.

1000+ images and applications

Continuously growing catalog of FIPS and STIG ready languages, frameworks, databases, application images and Helm charts, all signed and verified with SLA-backed security.

Frictionless for devs, secure for teams, a joy for everyone

“You’re not having to pay a security team to do all the things required for securing a container image because it’s already being done for you. The images are trusted, the software verified for minimal CVEs.”

Cameron Griffin

Security and speed are not a paradox anymore
Now free for all developers. Docker delivers enterprise security without slowing developers. Hardened images, automated scans, and verified provenance turn open source into your advantage.
Five pillars of supply chain security

Docker’s approach rests on five pillars: minimal images, signed provenance, complete SBOMs, VEX insights, and transparent verification.

“We evaluated multiple options for hardened base images and chose Docker Hardened Images (DHI) for its alignment with our supply chain security posture, developer tooling compatibility, Docker’s maturity in this space, and integration with our existing infrastructure. Our focus was on balancing trust, maintainability, and ecosystem compatibility.”

Accelerate every workflow. From apps to agents.
The fastest path from idea to running software. Whether you’re building agents or containers.

Build once, run anywhere

From your first line of code to production, containers make every environment consistent so you can move faster, debug less, and ship more confidently.

Containers + MCP: better together

Spin up and connect to containerized MCP servers like GitHub or Browserbase in seconds, right from Docker Desktop. Build smarter agents faster with no setup.

From client to server: the new kinds

Build smarter agents faster by spinning up and connecting to MCP servers. Interface with them with your favorite clients like Cursor or Claude directly from Docker Desktop.

“Docker enables us to do so much, and it’s constantly improving. And every time I look at the docs, I’m like, this is new. I didn’t know about this.”
