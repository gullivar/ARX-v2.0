Our unique advantage comes from uniting three companies under one roof, combining technology and services, giving us comprehensive visibility across social trends, influencer performance, and affiliate sales. Decades of exclusive social media and influencer marketing first-party data means we don't rely on guesswork—we know which creators drive real purchases and how to effectively reach your audience. We combine this data-driven approach with creative thinking to deliver the best of both agency expertise and technology platform capabilities, turning campaigns into measurable results. We also give our clients the access to real time data showing how campaigns are running and contributing to their goals including engagement, impressions, return on creator spend, sales, and, and bottom line. What type of influencer marketing campaigns do you run? We design full-funnel campaigns tailored to your goals, whether you're building awareness, driving engagement, or boosting conversions across social, and affiliate. At the top of the funnel, we drive awareness through product seeding, ambassador programs, and content creation that gets your brand in front of the right audiences. In the middle of the funnel, we focus on authentic product reviews and creator partnerships that build trust and influence purchase decisions. And at the bottom of the funnel, we tap into high-performing affiliate creators, from Mavely’s curated creator network, who know how to convert, driving real sales across ecommerce and retail channels. We also offer influencer-powered research studies, tapping into creator insights to help you test messaging, shape product launches, and gather real feedback through a more creative, consumer-driven lens. What makes your creator network high-affinity? The 200k high-affinity creators are in addition to the 14M creators we have in our networks. These are creators from Mavely’s performance network we’ve vetted, partnered with directly, and have seen drive real sales everyday. We track exactly how much each creator contributes to the brands they work with, including what their target audiences actually buy. In fact, this network drove over $1.5B in gross merchandise value for our customers last year alone. Because we know who’s converting and why, we can match your brand with creators who are proven to perform—making your campaigns more efficient, effective, and scalable. Check out some of the creators we work with every day. How do you find and vet creators? This is where we really shine. We combine human insight with powerful, proprietary data to find creators who not only look good on paper, but actually drive results. Our creator database includes over 14 million profiles, with deep, curated insights on 200,000 Mavely creators we’ve worked with directly. We track everything from engagement and content style to real sales performance. In 2024 alone, we saw over $1.5B in tracked sales, giving us unmatched visibility into what (and who) is actually converting. Our platform analyzes organic and paid performance, flags inauthentic audiences, surfaces brand safety risks, and uses real historical outcomes to recommend the creators most likely to succeed for your brand. We can even customize applications or pre-screening questions to find creators who match your campaign’s exact needs. Bottom line: We don’t guess—we know what works, and we use that to help you win. How do you track social media trends? We built our own social listening platform to spot what’s trending—before it takes off. It tracks conversations across social media, uncovering real-time insights on everything related to your brands.

It’s more than social media monitoring—it’s market research for your business and industry. Use it to guide content strategy, outpace your competitors, and make smarter, data-driven decisions from the very first scroll.
