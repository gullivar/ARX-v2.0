More info Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple
CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project. Easy installation Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run
out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Linux, macOS and other
Unix-like operating systems. Easy configuration Jenkins can be easily set up and configured via its web interface,
which includes on-the-fly error checks and built-in help. Plugins With hundreds of plugins in the Update Center, Jenkins integrates
with practically every tool in the continuous integration and
continuous delivery toolchain. Extensible Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture, providing
nearly infinite possibilities for what Jenkins can do. Distributed Jenkins can easily distribute work across multiple machines,
helping drive builds, tests and deployments across multiple
platforms faster. Recent posts 2025 Jenkins Board and Officer Election Results The Jenkins community has completed the 2025 elections.
