We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time, by adding, deleting, or changing provisions of this Agreement. If we amend this Agreement, then we will provide notice on our Website or as otherwise required by applicable law. Subject to any notice period that may be required by applicable law, after we provide notice of any amendment to this Agreement, if you use the Services or do not immediately close your account, then you agree to such amendments. 1.4. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. 1.4.1. “We”, “us”, “our” or “Zip” means Zip Co US, Inc. 1.4.2. “You” and “your” refers to the individual person who creates the associated Zip account and each and all of the persons who are granted access to, accept, or use the account and any person who has guaranteed payment of the account. 1.4.3. “Service” means the Zip Software Applications and related services from us, including without limitation the “Zip Anywhere” application and the “Zip Checkout” checkout software application used to facilitate purchases on the websites of participating merchants, and any other services or benefits we may provide you from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, “Services” as used herein specifically excludes any Loans originated by WebBank. 1.4.4. Your “account” means your account with Zip for Zip Software Applications, as described and governed by this Agreement. You may request a Loan to finance the purchase goods or services (“Goods”) from WebBank pursuant to the Service. All such Loans are governed solely by the Loan Agreement set forth below (as in effect at the time WebBank makes such Loan). In the event of any conflict between the Loan Agreement and this Agreement, the Loan Agreement shall control. 1.4.5. “Due Date” means any date by which you are required to make a payment as reflected on your Billing Statement or other communication provided to you by Zip on behalf of WebBank. 1.4.6. “Billing Statement” means any communication that Zip provides to you reflecting the activity on your account, the unpaid balances on your Loan(s), and/or Due Dates. Without limiting the foregoing, this includes any account dashboard that Zip makes available to you on its Website and any statement or summary for a billing cycle that Zip provides on behalf of WebBank. 1.4.7. “Website” means, collectively, the https://zip.co/us website and our US mobile app. 1.4.8 “Payment Schedule” means a list of payment amounts with corresponding due dates that we provide to you on behalf of WebBank in connection with a Loan that may update or supplement the schedule of payments set forth in each closed-end Truth in Lending disclosures you receive in connection with such Loan (each a “Disclosure”). 1.4.9 “WebBank” means WebBank, a Utah-chartered Industrial Bank. 1.4.10 “Zip Software Application(s)” means any software application provided by us relating to the Services, including without limitation, the “Zip Anywhere” application, the “Zip Checkout (also known as Zip)” checkout software application, and any other software application provided by us to interact with your Account. 1.5. PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE SEVERABLE. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions will continue to be effective. 1.6. Important disclosures. 1.6.1. Your name and address, as set forth in the application you submitted to us for this account, are incorporated by reference. Our services 2.1. YOUR ZIP ACCOUNT AND TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE SERVICE. 2.1.1. QUALIFICATION FOR AND ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT AND THE SERVICE. You must be qualified and receive an approval from Zip to obtain and access an account to use the Service. Whether you are qualified and whether any use of the Service is approved is determined by Zip and/or WebBank in their sole discretion. Subject to applicable law, Zip may close, suspend, restrict, or limit your account and/or your use of or ability to transact in connection with the Service in Zip’s sole discretion at any time for any reason without notice to you (this may include where we suspect fraudulent or suspicious activity in connection with your account). Zip also may cancel transactions at any time before a Retailer delivers any goods or services in its sole discretion at any time for any reason without notice to you. 2.1.2. USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND THE SERVICE. You may use your account and the Service only for personal, family, or household purposes, and not for any business or commercial purposes. You may not use your account or the Service to make a payment on any other obligation you have with us or our affiliates. You may not use or permit your account to be used to make any illegal transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not use your account or the Service in connection with any gambling activity or permit such use. 2.1.3. THE SERVICE. Using the Zip Software Application(s) and qualifying for Loans through the Service allows you to purchase goods or services offered by retailers who accept payment cards at the physical point of sale (“Retailers”) or online at Retailer websites. Different purchases may require different Zip Software Applications. Each time you use the Service to finance a purchase, you are requesting that WebBank make a direct loan (a “Loan”) to you for the amount of the purchase from the Retailer. For each transaction using the Zip Anywhere application, you will receive a virtual credit card number for the amount of the Loan, which is associated with a virtual credit card issued to Zip that you may use to facilitate payment for the transaction with the Retailer. Each virtual card number may be used only for a single transaction with a single Retailer (with the exception of Cards on file). “Cards on file” are virtual credit cards that are specifically designated by Zip to be used at a single Authorized Retailer, for multiple uses. “Authorized Retailers” are those which are made directly available by Zip from time to time. Using a Multi-use Card at any retailer, other than an Authorized Retailer, is deemed a violation of this Agreement and may result in your account being suspended or closed, among other remedies to which Zip or WebBank may be entitled. If you wish to make additional or different purchases that are financed using the Service, then you must apply for a new Loan through the Service and obtain a new virtual card number for each potential purchase. For all additional or different purchases which are not completed using a Card on file you must obtain a new virtual card number for each potential purchase. You are not authorized to use any virtual card number provided in the Service for any purpose other than the purchase for which you requested the Loan. Any unauthorized use of the virtual card by you will be considered theft and/or fraud, and will be declined and or reversed and may lead to deactivation of your account, among other remedies to which Zip or WebBank may be entitled. 2.1.4. YOUR ESTIMATED SPENDING POWER. Your Estimated Spending Power is the potential amount available to you to request Loans using the Service and is evaluated on a transaction-by-transaction basis each time you request a Loan. Any amount shown on your account dashboard or otherwise as your “Estimated Spending Power” is merely indicative and not a guarantee that any attempt to use the Service will be approved. Your Estimated Spending Power may be changed at any time and for any reason at WebBank’s and/or Zip’s sole discretion. 2.1.5. HOW TO MAKE A PAYMENT/PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION FOR AMOUNTS DUE UNDER EACH LOAN YOU REQUEST When you request a Loan you direct Zip to charge your first payment to your primary Payment Method. When you request the loan, You authorize Zip to initiate an authorization request for an amount equal to the first installment. If we receive information suggesting the payment will fail, you may not be able to continue with the Transaction. You also authorize Zip to deduct Automatic Payments from your Payment Method(s), beginning with your primary Payment Method, in the amounts and on the dates in each Disclosure and/or in any Payment Schedule or Updated Disclosure. Each Disclosure may be updated as a result of any items in your Transaction on Pre/Back-Order, refunds, cancelations, delayed shipment by the merchant, additional one-time payments or other adjustments. We’ll email you notice of the updated Disclosure when that happens. You also authorize us to combine multiple payments due on the same day into a single payment to be deducted from your Payment Method. (a) An 'Automatic Payment' is a payment, through your primary Payment Method, that Zip will automatically charge for all amounts owed to Zip and/or WebBank, also known as a preauthorized electronic fund transfer. Zip may, in its discretion, add or discontinue acceptance of any payment method offered to you at any time. (b) A ‘Payment Method’ means each payment method used by you and accepted by Zip from time to time. Current payment methods are most debt and credit cards and contactless payments, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. Your account must have at least one Payment Method at all times. If you wish to delete your only Payment Method, you’ll need to add a new one first. (c) You can add multiple Payment Methods to your Zip account, and you can update or change your primary Payment Method at any time via your account. If your primary Payment Method fails or cannot be charged for a payment for any reason, you authorize Zip to charge your other Payment Methods in the following order. Zip will attempt to Charge your primary Payment Method on the dates shown in each Disclosure and/or in any Payment Schedule. If your primary Payment Method fails, Zip may attempt to charge your other Payment Method(s) in order based on the last time the Payment Method was used to pay Zip, starting with your most recently used payment method. Zip may initiate authorization requests multiple times for each Payment Method. To the extent permitted by law, you authorize Zip to collect or reverse variable payment amounts from or to your Payment Method(s), as described in your Loan Agreement, Disclosure, any Payment Schedule, and any other agreement given to Zip authorizing Zip to debit your primary Payment Method for a variable amount. Zip will provide you with notice, including in the form of an updated Disclosure, and/or Payment Schedule in the event Zip collects or reverses a payment amount that differs from your original Disclosure. You also give us permission to either debit or credit your Payment Method(s) if we need to correct any errors. You are responsible for ensuring that you have sufficient funds via your Payment Method(s) to make Automatic Payments on the dates specified in each Disclosure and/or a Payment Schedule. If we are unable to charge or debit your Payment Method(s), and you did not make a one-time payment to cover the amount owed, this will be considered a late payment. We may attempt to collect the late payment on your next scheduled payment date along with the payment that is due on that date. If these attempts are unsuccessful, Zip reserves the right and you authorize us to collect these payments by debiting your primary Payment Method at a later time or date or debiting any other Payment Method you have given us permission to use. You are responsible for any fees charged by your financial institution associated with the payments. It’s your job to keep your Zip account updated with any changes to your debit/credit card information. If you don't update this information and we are unable to charge your Payment Method for the amount due, you may be subject to late fees and you may be charged fees by your financial institution. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you authorize Zip to make preauthorized electronic fund transfers from the Payment Method you selected at checkout or in the customer portal. 2.1.6. PRE-ORDERS AND BACK-ORDERS. Where you make a Zip Purchase, and one or more of the Good(s) or Service(s) in your order are temporarily out of stock or are not available at the time of your transaction (“Pre/back- order”) you understand and acknowledge that: (a) The Disclosure will be calculated based upon the total of the Transaction at the time of your request (including any Good(s) or Service(s) on Pre/back order)(“Total Cost of Transaction”); (b) The first payment due under the Disclosure will be calculated based on the Total Cost of Transaction; (c) If your Good(s) or Services(s) on Pre/back Order ship before the end of the settlement window (within 14 days of making your purchase at most merchants), we will continue to charge you in accordance with the Disclosure; (d) If your Good(s) or Service(s) on Pre/Back-order are not ready to be shipped before the end of the settlement window, we will: (d)(a) Recalculate any payments due under the Disclosure by deducting the total cost of any Pre/Back order(s) that have not yet been shipped from the Total Cost of the Transaction (“Updated Disclosure”); (d)(b) Refund you the difference if the amount you paid for the initial instalment exceeds the cost of goods already shipped from your Transaction (i.e. Total Cost of the Transaction minus Pre/back-order items that have not yet been shipped). Any amount that has been refunded will be added as part of any Concurrent Payment Schedule when the Good(s) or Service(s) ship; (d)(c) Adjust any applicable fees; and (d)(d) Notify you as soon as reasonably practicable of the Updated Disclosure (and associated Payment Schedule). (d)(d)(i) When your Good(s) or Service(s) on Pre/Back order are ready to be shipped, we will: Create a separate Payment Schedule, starting on the day that the merchant ships the Good (you acknowledge and agree that this may entail you having multiple Payment Schedules occurring concurrently with different start dates)(“Subsequent Payment Schedule”); (d)(d)(ii) Charge the first instalment owing under that Subsequent Payment Schedule on the day it is shipped; (d)(d)(iii) Notify you of the Subsequent Payment Schedule (including the Disclosure for that Subsequent Payment Schedule) as soon as reasonably practicable (you understand and acknowledge that you may receive this notice after we have deducted the initial instalment under the Subsequent Payment Schedule). You authorize Zip to deduct payments from your Payment Method for any Updated Disclosure and/or Subsequent Payment Schedule in accordance with this Agreement. (e) If you have a Good or Service(s) on Pre/Back-order, and it is not shipped within twelve (12) months of your transaction, you understand and acknowledge that the Good will be cancelled, and you will not be charged for the Good via your Zip Account. The Retailer may require You to provide an alternative payment when the item is ready to be ships. If a Good or Service(s) is Pre/Back- order, the total payments on all Payment Schedules relating to that Transaction (including any Concurrent Payment Schedules) will never exceed the total payments originally disclosed to you at the time that of your initial Zip Purchase (unless the item is subject to Post Checkout Update under section 2.1.7). 2.1.7 POST CHECKOUT UPDATE. You acknowledge that there may be circumstances where the cost of your Transaction increases post checkout (“Post Checkout Update”). This may occur, for example, where there has been a change of address or shipping method resulting in an increase to the applicable tax rate. If your Transaction is subject to a Post Checkout Update, you authorize Zip to: (a) recalculate any payments due under the Disclosure (which may result in an increase to instalment owing under the Payment Schedule); (b) deduct payments in accordance with the updated Disclosure and this Agreement. We will send you notice of any updated Disclosure, and associated Payment Schedule, as soon as reasonably practicable. 2.1.8. ADDITIONAL TERMS. From time to time, we may offer or introduce services other than the Services, in which case, you will be notified of the terms and conditions applicable to such services (“Additional Terms”) in any associated documents or other materials provided to you from time to time by or on behalf of Zip. We may adjust, add, or delete services, including the Services, at any time and without notice to you. Zip is not offering any benefits to you hereunder other than the Services. 2.1.9. OPERATIONS.

How Zip will resolve disputes 6.1. DISPUTES WITH ZIP. If a dispute arises between you and Zip about your account, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. In the event of a dispute, we encourage you first to contact Zip at us-support@care.zip.co to try resolving your problem directly with us. RESOLVING A DISPUTE WITH ARBITRATION PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT REJECT IT, THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. What claims are subject to arbitration: 1. If either you or we elect to use arbitration and make a demand for arbitration, then you and we must arbitrate any dispute or claim between you or any other user of your account, and us, our affiliates, agents, and/or dealers/merchants/Retailers that accept payment using any Service or the virtual card, except as noted below. 2. We will not require you to arbitrate any individual case in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court. However, if you respond to the collection lawsuit by claiming any wrongdoing for which a small claims court or your state’s equivalent court would not have jurisdiction, we may require the arbitration of both your claim and ours. 3. Notwithstanding any other language in this section, only a court, not an arbitrator, will decide disputes about the validity, enforceability, coverage, or scope of this section or any part thereof (including, without limitation, the next paragraph of this section and/or this sentence). However, any dispute or argument that concerns the validity or enforceability of the Agreement as a whole is for the arbitrator, not a court, to decide. 6.2. NO CLASS ACTIONS. YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY ACCOUNT HOLDER WHO IS NOT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER ON YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU AGREE THAT ONLY ACCOUNT HOLDERS ON YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE. If a court determines that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence will remain in force and the remainder will be null and void, and the court’s determination shall be subject to appeal. This paragraph does not apply to any lawsuit or administrative proceeding filed against us by a state or federal government agency even when such agency is seeking relief on behalf of a class of borrowers, including you. This means that we will not have the right to compel arbitration of any claim brought by such an agency. 6.3. HOW TO START AN ARBITRATION, AND THE ARBITRATION PROCESS. The party who wants to arbitrate must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit or in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to Zip Co US Inc., Legal Operations, 228 Park Ave S, PMB 59872, New York, New York 10003-1502, ATTN: ARBITRATION DEMAND. The party seeking arbitration must select an arbitration administrator, which can be either the American Arbitration Association (AAA), 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, NY 10271, www.adr.org , 1-800-778-7879 , or JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, www.jamsadr.com , 1-800-352-5267 . If neither administrator is able or willing to handle the dispute, then the court will appoint an arbitrator. If a party files a lawsuit in court asserting claim(s) that are subject to arbitration and the other party files a motion with the court to compel arbitration, which is granted, it will be the responsibility of the party asserting the claim(s) to commence the arbitration proceeding. The arbitration administrator will appoint the arbitrator and will tell the parties what to do next. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of legal experience. Once appointed, the arbitrator must apply the same law and legal principles, consistent with the FAA, that would apply in a court, but may use different procedural rules. If the administrator’s rules conflict with this Agreement, this Agreement will control. The arbitration will take place by phone, video conference, or at a reasonably convenient location. If you ask us to, we will pay all the fees the administrator or arbitrator charges. We will always pay your costs, to the extent you prevail on claims you assert against us in an arbitration proceeding. 6.4. GOVERNING LAW FOR ARBITRATION. This Arbitration section of your Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). New York law shall apply to the extent state law is not preempted and otherwise relevant under the FAA. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award. 6.5. EXCEPTIONS TO INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS AND ARBITRATION. You and Zip agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Zip’s intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief. 6.6. RIGHT TO REJECT ARBITRATION. You may reject this arbitration provision by mailing a special rejection notice to Zip at us-support@care.zip.co . You must sign the rejection notice, affirmatively state that you do not want arbitration to apply to this Agreement and provide your name, address, telephone number, and account number. We must receive your rejection notice within 60 days after the date that you first consent to this Agreement. You may not reject arbitration by phone or by any method other than the method described above. If you reject this arbitration provision, it will not affect any other provision of the Agreement. Miscellaneous 7.1. ENFORCEABILITY AND GOVERNING LAW.
