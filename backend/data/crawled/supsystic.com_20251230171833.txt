WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems in the world.

This CMS is free, open-source, and easy to use.

Many website owners prefer WordPress because of its ability to be customized.

Using the best WordPress plugins, you can customize your website to get the look and functionality you want. And, the good news is, it can be done quite easily.

The WordPress ecosystem has 58,000+ best WordPress plugins, each designed for a particular function–SEO, security, social media integration, backup, and more. How do you pick the best WordPress plugin for your site?

We are here for you.

Today’s blog post covers an overview of the best WordPress plugins website owners use to improve their sites.

What Is A Plugin For A Website?

Generally, WordPress websites lack features to perform certain tasks, such as checking broken links and search engine optimization. The best WordPress plugins will help you solve this problem and many more. A plugin is a small piece of software that adds extra features to your WordPress website.

You can find a plugin for anything from search engine optimization to adding a contact form that helps you collect leads.

Are Plugins Worth It On WordPress?

Think of plugins as the bread and butter of your website. Without plugins, WordPress would be an unfriendly platform.

These software programs can help you build a powerful online presence or even grow your email list.

Let’s take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of using the best WordPress plugins to determine whether they are worth it on WordPress.

Advantages
Reliable

You can count on regularly updated plugins to work consistently. Also, a community of developers tests the best WordPress plugins. You can trust that most will work as advertised and provide you with the features you need.

Saves Time

Plugins automate tasks that would take hours, days, or weeks to complete. This way, busy entrepreneurs can focus on other tasks.

Flexible

Best WordPress plugins give you the ability to customize your website and add features that are not available by default. You can also use them to create custom functionality. For example, if you want a contact form on your homepage but don’t want it to show up anywhere else, plugins can help you do that.

Disadvantages
Slow your site

Plugins can make your site slower by adding more code to load, especially when you are using many plugins or poorly coded ones.

Security vulnerabilities

Even the best WordPress plugins may contain security flaws, leaving your website vulnerable to attacks. Always keep track of plugin updates and install them as soon as they become available.

Compatibility issues

Some of the best WordPress plugins may not be compatible with your theme or other plugins. This can cause unexpected behavior or errors that are difficult to troubleshoot.

As we have seen, plugins are worth the risk because they can improve the functionality of your site, making it more attractive to visitors. But there are precautions you should take before installing a plugin.

What Are The Things To Look Out For When Choosing The Best WordPress Plugins?

Plugins are a double-edged sword. They can be extremely helpful but can also cause problems. Here are the key factors to consider when choosing a plugin:

Plugin features

You must look out for the plugin’s features before moving on to other factors mentioned below. Ensure the plugin does what you want to do.

User reviews and average Ratings

As with anything else, you should research before settling on a plugin. User reviews and ratings are the first indicators of the capabilities of a plugin. WordPress plugins with high ratings are typically more stable and reliable than their counterparts with low ratings. We recommend installing the best WordPress plugins with an average rating of 4 stars or higher.

Active users

This parameter is related to the number of reviews, but it also shows how many people use the plugin. A higher number of active users is an indication that the plugin works.

Support and documentation

In addition to having many active users and high ratings, a plugin should have support options like forums or email support. This way, you can ask questions when something goes wrong with the plugin.

Plugin compatibility

No one wants to spend hours trying to get a plugin to work with their website. Therefore, you should ensure the plugin you install is compatible with the latest WordPress version. Also note that some plugins can work together, but others can’t. And this may break your site.

Regular updates

Security vulnerabilities are a common problem for WordPress sites. And plugins are the most susceptible to them. To protect your site from security threats, keep your plugins up-to-date. Most plugin developers send an email alert when there’s a new version for you to update.

How Do I Add Plugins To My Website?

Adding the best WordPress plugins to your WordPress website is a bit daunting at first. But once you understand how it works, you’ll find it not too hard to do. You can achieve this by navigating to the Plugins section on your WordPress dashboard. Click on the “add new” tab to search for the plugin of your choice. When you find it, click “Install Now” and then activate the plugin. You can also manually download the free plugin from a third-party website as a .zip file. Then upload it to your WordPress dashboard. From here, you install and activate the plugin to use it.

How Many Plugins Should I Use in WordPress?

There’s no hard and fast rule for how many plugins you should use, but here is a simple guideline to help you. Only install the best WordPress plugins that your website needs. Most websites have between 20-70 WordPress plugins. But that’s not an exact number. Some websites can have more, others less. Many people wrongfully believe the number of plugins is directly related to the performance of their website. They think that more plugins lead to a slower website and vice versa. This isn’t actually true. A slow website is caused by poorly-coded plugins, sites that are not well-optimized for search engines, and incompatible plugins.

What Are The Best WordPress Plugins?

Before we delve into the best WordPress plugins, you should note that what’s best for one person may not be the best for another person. Therefore, the best WordPress plugins help you meet your website’s goals. If you want to increase sales, you’ll go for a plugin that helps you set up an eCommerce store for your business. Likewise, you’ll install an SEO Plugin if you only need to improve your site’s search rankings. Note: Supsystic is home to the top WordPress plugins that every WordPress site owner needs to take their business to the next level. Below are the factors we considered to select the best WordPress plugins to help you improve your business.

#1. Features– We considered the plugins with powerful features to help automate most of your website’s tasks.

#2. Secure–We took into account plugin updates to determine whether they are secure to add to your WordPress website.

#3. Price –We included affordable plugins with nice features that most website owners are looking for. As some plugins offer better free versions than others, we considered this factor to bring you free options for your business.

#4. Good support–To eliminate the frustration that comes with bad support, our team ensured all the plugins on our list are backed by a supportive team.

 

The availability of forums was also a plus when making this list. Here are the best WordPress plugins to upscale your business:

1. WordPress Page Building Plugins

WordPress page builders are the new trend in web design. These page creation tools offer you the easiest and most efficient way to create beautiful, professional-looking pages in WordPress. Whether you are building an eCommerce site or want to display your portfolio, these plugins will help you get the job done within minutes. Page-building plugins work by allowing you to drag and drop elements onto your page and then customize them with a built-in visual editor. This way, you can add and arrange content on your site on the fly without manually coding every page. With page-building tools, you get over 100 preset templates to get you started within no time. Plus, you don’t need coding skills to build your pages.

Why use a WordPress page-building plugin?

Many WordPress users are familiar with the default editor, which lets you create and edit content by typing in a text box. While this works well for many purposes, it isn’t ideal if you want to create a professional-looking website or blog. #1. Using a page builder plugin is much easier and faster than editing code directly in WordPress. #2. It’s also a good way to learn more about the inner workings of WordPress. Page builders let you see how code works without writing it yourself. This knowledge may help you, especially when you want to start developing your own plugins or themes. #3. Page-building plugins streamline the design process. Working with these tools can help you make your website more user-friendly to non-technical users. #4. They allow you to easily add content. You can add text, images, and videos to any page by using the drag-and-drop features in the editor.

#5. The best WordPress page-building plugins let you create dynamic content that responds to different screen sizes and devices. For example, if you are designing a website for mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers, these plugins save you the time you would have spent adjusting each element of your site for each device.

What are the drawbacks of using page-building plugins in WordPress?

While the benefits of using page builders are clear, they have drawbacks. You should keep them in mind.

Users are limited to the features that the plugin offers. Free plugins come with fewer functionalities than premium ones. Still, even many paid plans lack several features. In this case, you may need to switch your page builder for another one to get more customization options.
Some page builders don’t play well with most WordPress themes. You may find that your chosen WordPress theme doesn’t work as expected when using a particular plugin.
Plugins may have security flaws that hackers can exploit to gain access to your site. Of course, the same could be said of any plugin you use. It just happens frequently with page builders since they are popular and widespread.
Some page builders are more customizable than others. If you want complete control over your site’s design and functionality, using code may be better suited for you than a page builder plugin.
What are the best WordPress page builders?

When looking for a page builder plugin, there are key factors you should take into consideration. These include:

Features and functionality: What does the plugin offer in terms of features, such as drag-and-drop tools and templates? Is it easy to get started with the plugin, or do you need to know some code first?
Ease of use: How easy is creating a website using this plugin? Does it have an intuitive interface that allows even beginners to get started quickly?

That said, the best WordPress page builder plugin is the one that meets your needs and expectations. We tested and reviewed the most popular plugins on the market. Our top picks for page building are Elementor, SeedProd, and Divi. You also need a plugin like Maintenance Mode / Coming Soone by Supsystic when maintaining your site. Or to get the word out before releasing new products.

2. WordPress SEO Plugins

Today, search engine optimization (SEO) is a crucial element of any website. Without proper SEO, you won’t be able to get your content in front of the right audience. The key to effective SEO is knowing how search engines work and what they look for when ranking websites. Here is where many beginners make the mistake of believing that all they need to do is write good content. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. In order for your content to rank high in search engines like Google and Bing, you need to optimize your site. This includes optimizing everything from the titles of your pages to their body text and images for search engines to understand what they are about. WordPress website owners can make the process of SEO much easier by using plugins. These tools help you write better content, optimize your site for search engines, and even give you analytics on how many people are visiting your site.

Common features of the best WordPress plugins for SEO include:

Keyword research tools that help you find the right words to target with your content.
Redirects for moving old URLs to new ones after making changes to your site.
Adding a sitemap to your site for search engines to easily find all your content.
Optimizing titles, descriptions, and meta tags for Google and other search engines.
Analyzing your website’s speed to ensure it loads quickly on mobile devices.
Providing you with analytics about how many visitors are coming to your site from search engines.
SEO audit tools to help you increase your site’s performance.
Why use a WordPress SEO Plugin?

SEO is a complex process, and it can be difficult for WordPress website owners to keep up with the latest best practices. WordPress SEO plugins take care of many of the most important tasks involved in SEO, such as writing better content and optimizing your site for search engines. Here are the reasons why people use WordPress SEO Plugins:

SEO plugins offer website owners a quick way to optimize their sites for search engines. This is perfect for anyone who lacks the time and patience to learn the ins and outs of SEO.

SEO plugins are easy to use. Unlike other software, WordPress SEO plugins don’t require any special technical knowledge or coding skills. All you need is a website, an active license key, and some basic WordPress knowledge (which most people have).
Most of these plugins are affordable. WordPress has a huge ecosystem of developers, designers, and other professionals who create high-quality plugins at affordable prices. You don’t have to spend a fortune on SEO.
What are the drawbacks of using WordPress SEO Plugins?

WordPress SEO plugins aren’t perfect. Here are the drawbacks of using these tools:

They can slow down your website. Not all plugins are created equal. Some may cause performance issues or even break your site altogether.
All of the best SEO plugins have a learning curve. You need to spend time learning how they work, how to use them, and what kind of results you can expect from using them.
WordPress SEO plugins can be confusing to use. The plugin ecosystem is extremely large, meaning there are hundreds (if not thousands) of options to choose from. You must know exactly what you need and how it works before buying anything. This can be difficult if you’re not familiar with WordPress or search engine optimization (SEO).
What are the best WordPress SEO Plugins?

Yoast SEO is by far the most popular WordPress SEO plugin. It’s been around for over a decade, has millions of active installs, and is trusted by many large organizations. You can use it to optimize your site for search engines and make sure you don’t break any rules (which can cause your site to get banned). All In One SEO and RankMath are two of the most popular alternatives to Yoast. RankMath, created in 2020, has become one of the top plugins in the WordPress SEO space. These tools are essential to rank well on Google or Bing. With the right blend of WordPress plugins, these SEO tools can be a game changer for your business.

3. WordPress Email Marketing Plugins

Email marketing allows you to build relationships with your customers and keep them up-to-date on new products or services.

WordPress email marketing plugins allow you to build an email list and send your customers newsletters, sales emails, and automated messages. They also provide a way to create forms on your site that capture visitor data you can use in future campaigns. These marketing plugins come with built-in funnels, automation, and tracking tools that allow you to create more effective email campaigns.

4. e-Commerce Plugins

Online shopping is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. According to Statista, e-Commerce sales will account for over 20% of all retail sales by 2026. Many shoppers prefer to buy from the comfort of their homes. They want to do so effortlessly. The convenience of buying products online has driven the shift from physical stores to online shopping. With just a few clicks, people can find what they want, purchase it, and have it delivered to their doorstep. This has led to a rise in the popularity of e-Commerce plugins. These tools allow you to create a store where shoppers can browse products and make purchases. e-Commerce plugins are designed to make it easy to create a website that can handle sales. They come with features such as storefront creation, order management, product listing, shopping carts, payment processing, and more. Most e-Commerce plugins offer additional features such as inventory management, customer loyalty programs, etc.

Why use an e-Commerce plugin?

The popularity of e-Commerce plugins has coincided with the growth in online shopping. Thanks to their convenience and ease of use, people are buying more and more products online. With Internet-based stores, owners aren’t limited to the physical space of a brick-and-mortar store. You can sell products and services from anywhere in the world. The main reasons why people use e-Commerce plugins are the following:

You don’t have to build your store from scratch. The best WordPress plugins for e-Commerce come with ready-made themes and other top features to help you speed up the process.
Users don’t have to worry about the technical details; instead, they can focus on running their business. Plus, these plugins come with a variety of features that allow you to customize your store according to your needs and preferences.
What are the drawbacks of using e-Commerce plugins?

Even though eCommerce plugins are great, they also come with their own set of drawbacks. For example, some of them may be difficult to use and require a lot of time to set up. Others may not offer the level of customization that you need for your store. Still, there are other drawbacks as well.

Incompatible plugins. Some plugins may not work seamlessly with your hosting provider or themes.
Limited payment gateways. You may find out that your ideal e-Commerce doesn’t support top payment gateways.
Security issues. As with other plugins, e-Commerce tools may also not offer the level of security you need to protect your site.
What are the best WordPress eCommerce Plugins?

Since the beginning of e-Commerce, plugins have played a huge role in shaping the industry. They provide all the necessary tools to build an online store without worrying about the technology behind it. Moreover, they allow you to customize your website and make it unique so that users find it more appealing than your competitor’s sites. According to our research, the best WordPress eCommerce plugins offer a wide range of features. They should be easy to install and use, have a responsive design, and support various currencies. WooCommerce, Shopify, and BigCommerce make up the top three on our list. Many marketers also use another set of plugins known as WordPress Pricing table generators to display product prices. This allows shoppers to compare prices. An example of a pricing table plugin is the Pricing Table by Supsystic. Let me also introduce you to another unique eCommerce plugin: Easy Digital Downloads. It lets you sell digital products such as music, videos, and software. You can sell directly from your website or other marketplaces like Amazon and eBay. MemberPress also allows you to sell digital products, but it’s mainly designed for membership websites. You can create an account and pay a monthly or annual fee to access certain features.

5. WordPress Pricing Table Plugins

You’ve got a great product that you want to sell online. But how do you convince potential customers to make a purchase? Thousands of online sellers create a pricing table. This table lists your products and their prices. It’s an effective way to show customers what they’re getting for their money. A pricing table gives customers the information they need to decide whether or not to buy from you. WordPress pricing table plugins come with robust features that you can use to build your tables. They also have simple, easy-to-use interfaces that let you create pricing tables without needing any coding knowledge.

Why use a WordPress pricing table plugin?

6. WordPress Security Plugins

In this era of cybercrime, cyber-attacks, and data breaches, you can’t afford to ignore your site’s security. These attacks can cripple your business, cause downtime, and expose your customers’ data. The best way to prevent these attacks is by having an adequate security system in place. But you can’t expect to be able to set up an entire security system on your own. That’s where WordPress security plugins come in handy. These plugins help you track all your site’s security issues. They also provide solutions for any problems that arise. Security plugins usually include a firewall, malware scanner, and intrusion prevention system (IPS). They also provide real-time security updates for your site. While functionalities vary based on the plugin you choose, all security plugins have one thing in common. They offer website monitoring and protection. With these features, you’ll be able to track your site’s security issues and receive alerts when there are any problems. You can also get real-time updates about new threats that may affect your site.

Why use a WordPress security plugin?

In order to keep your WordPress site safe, you need to have a security plugin installed. These plugins offer plenty of benefits that will help you prevent cyber attacks and deal with any issues that arise. You should consider using a WordPress security plugin because they:

Reduce the likelihood of security breaches and hacks.
Provide real-time updates on the latest threats to your site.
Offer site monitoring and protection.
Provide an easy-to-use interface that makes it simple to manage site security.
Block brute force attacks to keep your WordPress login safe.
Remove spam comments.
What are the drawbacks of using WordPress security plugins?

Using a WordPress security plugin can benefit your site, but these tools also come with a few downsides. These plugins can be a bit overwhelming for some users. Most of them include many features and settings, which may make it difficult to determine which ones you need. If you don’t know what you’re doing, this can make your site more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Another drawback of using WordPress security plugins is that they often require paying for a subscription. You may not need all of the features included in these plugins, which means you could end up paying for features that don’t benefit your site at all. Some plugins may not be updated as frequently as they should be. This can leave your website vulnerable to new threats not covered by your plugin’s security features. You should always ensure you have the latest version of any plugin on your site. Also, security plugins are not a replacement for good password management practices. Many people forget that using a WordPress security plugin is only one part of the equation when it comes to keeping your site safe from cyber attacks.

What are the best WordPress Security Plugins?

Now that you understand what WordPress security plugins do and how they can benefit your site, the top plugins in this area are:

Wordfence,
iThemes Security Pro, and
Sucuri.

In a bid to ensure all your plugins are without any security vulnerabilities, consider purchasing these tools from certified developers like Supsystic.

7. WordPress Anti-Spam Plugins

Spam is unwanted and unsolicited email messages sent in bulk to users without their consent. This method is commonly used for phishing purposes. Scammers try to trick you into giving them personal information by pretending they are someone else. These security plugins will help you avoid website spam and malicious attacks. They are also useful in reducing the number of junk comments on your site. WordPress Anti-Spam plugins can be used in conjunction with CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA. These are two examples of a type of test that people have to complete before they can post anything on your website.

Why use a WordPress anti-spam plugin?

If you run a website where people can comment on posts, you must take security measures to prevent spam and malicious attacks. The best WordPress plugins for anti-spam will:

Help you reduce the amount of junk content posted on your website.
Stop malicious attacks and prevent hackers from gaining access to your site.
Help prevent people from using bots to post spam comments on your site.
What are the drawbacks of using WordPress anti-spam plugins?

These plugins can:

Slow down your site
Be difficult to set up
Block legitimate visitors if not configured correctly.
What are the best WordPress anti-spam plugins?

Akismet, WP Cerber Security, and Titan Anti-Spam & Security are the top three WordPress security plugins recommended by our expert team. These three plugins will help you fight spam and malicious attacks on your website.

8. WordPress Backup and Caching Plugins

Losing all your site’s data is a real possibility—especially if you don’t have a backup plan in place. When a hacker infiltrates your site and steals all of its data, you may never be able to retrieve the lost information. That’s why it’s crucial to have a WordPress backup plugin installed on your site. These plugins will automatically create backups of all the data on your server and store them in an off-site location such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. This way, you can recover them if something goes wrong with the original files. Conversely, caching makes your site load faster by storing certain files on your server. The process involves taking the data for these files, which are usually static, and then compressing them into smaller versions that can be loaded quickly. With caching, the server will only have to load up a few files from its hard drive instead of all the data on each page. This can make your site much quicker to load and, therefore, more user-friendly.

Why use backup and caching plugins?

Most people don’t realize how quickly their website can be taken down until they experience it firsthand. If your site is hacked, there’s nothing worse than rebuilding it from scratch and losing all your hard work. Backup plugins will:

help you restore your site’s data in the event of an attack.
provide an additional layer of security by preventing hackers from accessing your site’s database.
make it easier to move your site to a new server or host with less downtime than if you didn’t have a backup.

Caching plugins:

Make your site load faster and more efficiently by storing commonly used data on your server instead of pulling it from the web every time someone visits.
What are the drawbacks of using WordPress backup and caching plugins?

While they are a necessary part of your WordPress site, there are a few disadvantages of using even the best plugins for backup and caching. They:

Come with a price tag. Although these tools are free to download, you must pay between $10-$100 per year depending on your desired features.
If used incorrectly, both backup and caching plugins may slow your site’s speed.
What are the best WordPress backup and caching plugins?

Our research focused on the following criteria: How easy is it to set up, use and configure? Does it make your site load faster? What are the security risks associated with using this plugin? Is there a free version available, or do you have to pay for it? As a result, we recommend BackWPup, BackupBuddy, or UpdraftPlus for backups and W3 Total Cache or WP Rocket for caching.

9. WordPress Plugins For Galleries, Sliders, and Slideshows

Visual and interactive content is a powerful way to engage your visitors. Many websites feature a gallery of images, slideshows, or sliders to showcase their work. While these are great ways to show off your work, they can be difficult and time-consuming to create. Thankfully, plugins can help you easily create galleries, sliders, and slideshows without any coding knowledge or skills. These WordPress plugins bring the power of modern web design to your WordPress website. Do you need an easy-to-use gallery plugin, a slider that lets you build custom slideshows or sliders from scratch, or something to help create beautiful interactive graphics? With the right plugin, you can create beautiful galleries and slideshows that professionally present your work.

Why use a WordPress plugin for galleries or sliders?

Many WordPress website owners don’t have the coding skills or time to create their own websites. They rely on plugins to help them build their site with the latest web design trends. Gallery plugins let you easily add beautiful galleries and slideshows that professionally showcase your work. Slider plugins allow you to create custom slideshows from scratch using CSS3 animations, video backgrounds, and more than 25 transitions between slides. These plugins allow you to:

Quickly create a gallery without any coding knowledge or skills.
Save time by creating amazing galleries and slideshows.
Customize your gallery with features like image filters, social sharing buttons, and more.
