We've saved probably 90% on our infrastructure bill, mainly because we can use bursty compute whenever we need it." — Read case study https://media.getrunpod.io/latest/aneta-video-1.mp4 Play video "Runpod has allowed the team to focus more on the features that are core to our product and that are within our skill set, rather than spending time focusing on infrastructure, which can sometimes be a bit of a distraction.” — Read case study https://media.getrunpod.io/latest/gendo-video.mp4 Play video "Runpod helped us scale the part of our platform that drives creation. That’s what fuels the rest—image generation, sharing, remixing. It starts with training." — Read case study Play video "Runpod allowed us to reliably handle scaling from zero to over 1,000 requests per second in our live application." — Read case study https://media.getrunpod.io/latest/scatter-lab-video.mp4 Play video "Runpod has allowed us to focus entirely on growth and product development without us having to worry about the GPU infrastructure at all." — Bharat, Co-founder of InstaHeadshots Read case study https://media.getrunpod.io/latest/magic-studios-video.mp4 Play video "We could stop worrying about infrastructure and go back to building. That’s the real win.” — Read case study Play video “The main value proposition for us was the flexibility Runpod offered. We were able to scale up effortlessly to meet the demand at launch.” — Josh Payne, Coframe CEO Read case study Play video "After migration, we were able to cut down our server costs from thousands of dollars per day to only hundreds." — Read case study Play video Runpod’s scalable GPU infrastructure gave us the flexibility we needed to match customer traffic and model complexity—without overpaying for idle resources. — Read case study Impact Get more done for every dollar.
