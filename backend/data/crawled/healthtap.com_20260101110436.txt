Doctor was available right away, listened to my symptoms and prescribed the right medication. He made sure no allergies and that was it. Very fast and easy.

Pat J.

From Texas

The doctor made me feel comfortable right away, very easy to ask about concerns I might have had and great feedback from the doctor.

Patrice P.

From New York

My doctor was very professional, thorough, and careful to ask me numerous relevant questions. She answered my questions not only in a detailed manner, but also in a way I could understand.

Betty M.

From Tennessee

It was quick & easy to book the appointment. I was able to get a PC appointment the next morning…within 12 hours! I connected and got my ongoing meds refilled. It was so nice for me living in a rural community.

Having a general or "primary care" doctor decreases hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Even if you're healthy, having a primary care doctor helps prevent serious illness.

If you struggle with chronic issues such as diabetes, hypertension, or asthma, having a primary care doctor could be the difference between life and death.
