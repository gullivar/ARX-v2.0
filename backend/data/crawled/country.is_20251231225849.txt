Country | Free IP-to-Country Geolocation API Country f6ba738 Star Country is a free IP-to-country geolocation API that returns a user’s country based on their IP address. Country runs an open instance —no API key needed. You can also self-host with Docker . Usage The API has a minimal interface. GET / Returns the country of the IP making the request, typically the user’s browser or app. /* curl -s https://api.country.is/ */ GET /{ip} Returns the country of any given IP. The API supports both with IPv4 and IPv6. Here, we query . /* curl -s https://api.country.is/77.1.2.3 */ GET /info Provides metadata about the API, including when the data sources were last updated. /* curl -s https://api.country.is/info */ The API automatically updates MaxMind data every 24 hours in the background. Our hosted service is ideal for client-side apps. If you require to run high-volume queries server-side, consider self-hosting or querying the MaxMind GeoIP data directly. Deployment If you prefer not to use our server, you can self-host with Docker. # Runs country on port 3000

  lineofflight/country Set the two environment variables to your MaxMind account ID and the license key associated with it . Quick answers Is the API free for commercial use? Yes, absolutely. Does the API have any limit of calls? We rate-limit queries from the same IP to 10 per second; you should use Maxmind's data directly if you run a high volume of queries server-side. The API has no limits in other use cases: web, mobile apps, etc. Will the API work in the future? We've been running for a decade and have no plans to shut down. For critical applications, we still recommend self-hosting for control. Notes The API uses geolocation data provided by MaxMind and optionally Cloudfare . Since 30 December 2019, you need to register for a license key to download the MaxMind data if you're self-hosting. We don't log requests on our server. However, Cloudflare, which we use for caching, aggregates metadata for analytics and performance monitoring.
