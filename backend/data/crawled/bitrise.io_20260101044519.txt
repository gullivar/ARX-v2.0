Frequently Asked Questions Is Bitrise a CI/CD solution? Yes, Bitrise is a complete CI/CD solution, with a specific focus on CI/CD for mobile apps. Mobile CI/CD is significantly more complex than web or backend CI/CD, and Bitrise solves for the specific challenges of building, testing and deploying iOS and Android apps. Bitrise also goes beyond basic CI/CD, with tools and add-ons that simplify mobile DevOps at every stage of the app development lifecycle . What tools do I need for CI/CD? Core CI/CD tooling includes a version control system (e.g. Git), a CI server or cloud CI service to run builds and tests, artifact storage, and a delivery/orchestration tool for deployments. Tools for security scanning and build monitoring are also commonly integrated. For mobile app development (iOS and Android), you will also need workflows for compilation, code signing, real device and emulator testing, and release management. How is mobile CI/CD different from web or backend CI/CD? Mobile CI/CD is more complex than web or backend CI/CD for a few key reasons: Mobile development requires specialized toolchains and macOS-based build environments. Most generic CI/CD platforms do not provide these as standard. Code signing is a mandatory step for mobile apps. Mobile apps need to be tested across a wide variety of real devices and/or emulators to ensure compatibility. Mobile app development is subject to tight controls imposed by OS providers. iOS and Android tech stack requirements update frequently, often at short notice. Mobile apps are distributed as compiled binary files that must be installed on a device each time, unlike web applications which are usually delivered as code or scripts that run on a server. Processes and rules for deploying to app stores mean that buggy releases cannot always be easily rolled back or patched. For these reasons, mobile CI/CD requires a separate, dedicated pipeline to handle compilation, code signing, device testing, and app store submissions. ‍ Can generic CI/CD tools handle mobile pipelines? While general-purpose CI/CD tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions can technically be configured for mobile development, they require significant setup and ongoing maintenance to handle iOS and Android builds effectively. Jenkins requires manual configuration of macOS build agents, iOS code signing, and Android SDK management. CircleCI and GitHub Actions offer some mobile capabilities, but lack native support for critical workflows like automated code signing, real device and emulator testing, and app store deployment. Teams using these platforms for mobile often spend weeks on initial setup and considerable time maintaining custom scripts as iOS and Android requirements change. Bitrise eliminates this overhead by providing mobile-optimized infrastructure and workflows out-of-the-box. What's the best CI/CD tool for native iOS development? For native iOS development, you need a CI/CD platform that provides reliable macOS build infrastructure, seamless Xcode integration, automated certificate and provisioning profile management, and streamlined TestFlight and App Store deployment. While you can configure Jenkins or GitHub Actions for iOS builds, maintaining macOS runners and managing code signing complexity often becomes a bottleneck. Bitrise is purpose-built for iOS development, offering dedicated macOS stacks with up-to-date Xcode versions within 24 hours, automatic code signing, and native integrations with TestFlight and App Store Connect. Our iOS-specific Steps library means you can build production-ready pipelines in hours rather than weeks. What’s the best CI/CD tool for Android development? Android CI/CD requires managing Android SDK versions, handling APK/AAB compilation, managing keystores for app signing, and coordinating releases to Google Play Console. CircleCI, Jenkins, and similar tools can run Android builds but require custom configuration for signing, testing on real devices, and Play Store deployment. Bitrise provides pre-configured Android build environments with all necessary SDK tools, automated keystore management, integration with Firebase Test Lab for virtual device testing, plus direct deployment to Google Play tracks (internal, alpha, beta, production). Whether you're building with Kotlin, Java, or cross-platform frameworks, Bitrise streamlines your Android CI/CD from commit to store. What is the overall best CI/CD for mobile projects? The best CI/CD tool for mobile projects depends on your team’s needs, but obviously we’re going to say Bitrise is the best! But really: we are the mobile-first CI/CD platform. While tools like CircleCI, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions can be customized to run mobile pipelines, this often just leads to more glue code, more tooling drift, and more DevOps headaches in the long-run. At Bitrise, our big differentiators are that we offer macOS build environments, automated code signing, real device testing, app store deployment, and robust integration with cross-platform frameworks like Kotlin, Flutter, and React Native. All this is absolutely essential for mobile CI/CD, and with Bitrise you get it out-of-the-box and ready to go with minimal setup and maintenance. How does CI/CD work for cross-platform mobile development? Cross-platform mobile development frameworks (like React Native, Flutter, Kotlin Multiplatform, and Ionic) are software toolkits that allow developers to build mobile apps for multiple operating systems using a single codebase. Developers using cross-platform tools generally need a CI/CD solution that can handle compiling for both iOS and Android, platform-specific code-signing, and multiplatform testing and deployment. Bitrise provides out-of-the-box support for all major cross-platform frameworks, with dedicated Steps, pre-configured workflows, and optimized build environments for your framework of choice. Does Bitrise offer free CI/CD? Yes! Bitrise offers a free tier with fully-managed, cloud-based build infrastructure. This is fundamentally different from "free" CI/CD tools like Jenkins, which require you to self-host your own infrastructure (i.e. pay for macOS hardware or cloud instances). With Bitrise's free tier, you get instant access to ready-to-go macOS and Linux build environments as part of the package. Our free tier is perfect for individual developers and small teams getting started with mobile CI/CD. As your project grows, you can explore paid plans for additional build capacity and advanced features. For more detail, check out our pricing page .
