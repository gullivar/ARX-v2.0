Deploy with one command
Let it spike. We got you.

Your application runs globally, handles millions of requests, and scales without you thinking about it.

Pay only when your code runs 

(Not to keep servers warm.)

Wall Clock vs. CPU Time

Never pay for idle time waiting for slow APIs, LLMs, or humans. Cloudflare charges only for compute, not wall time, even during long agent workflows or hibernating WebSockets.
