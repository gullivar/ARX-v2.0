This Order puts an aggressive upward pressure on pricing for all copper lines. Read Overview POTS Replacement & Cellular Failover FAQs Answers to common questions about E-911 compliance, elevator phones, fire panels, fax, alarms, and migration from copper to IP with cellular failover. What is POTS replacement and why switch now? POTS replacement migrates legacy analog copper phone lines to IP with cellular or wired backhaul. It reduces monthly telco costs, improves reliability, and keeps life-safety endpoints online as carriers retire copper. Will POTS replacement support E-911 and compliance needs? Yes. DataRemote solutions maintain full E-911 access and are designed to meet common life-safety requirements for elevators, fire panels, and alarms when deployed per AHJ and local code. Do elevators, fire panels, fax and alarms work over your solution? Yes. POTS IN A BOX® supports elevator emergency phones, fire/burglar alarm panels, fax/analog modem data, ring-down lines, and voice—while preserving DTMF, line-seizure, and supervision behaviors. What is cellular failover and how does it improve uptime? Cellular failover uses 5G/LTE as a backup path when the primary ISP or copper line is down or degraded. DataRemote’s 90X1 and 90X2 include dual SIM slots and automatic SIM redundancy—if one carrier/SIM fails, the appliance immediately reroutes to the secondary SIM (and auto-fails back when the primary recovers). Customers supply their own 5G/LTE plan (BYO SIM). This design keeps elevator phones, fire panels, alarms, fax, and voice online with carrier diversity and higher uptime. What networks and power options are supported? Appliances support 5G/LTE cellular, Ethernet WAN, battery backup/UPS, and monitoring. Optional out-of-band management helps keep life-safety lines reachable during ISP outages. Ready To Replace Your POTS Lines?
