Studies across urban centres worldwide show that commuters are often mentally drained even before reaching their destination.
Yet almost every navigation app only cares about speed and cost.
So as a design engineer, I asked: Why can’t navigation help you stay calm?
Here’s what CalmWay (https://tempo-deployment-6a68b84b-7185-46cc-nu.vercel.app/) offers:
1. Kai, your AI companion for stressful moments
2. Guided breathing to reset on the go
3. Calm music for mood regulation
4. Mood reflections to track your commute’s impact
5. Streaks to reinforce mental well-being
6. Stress-aware reroutes around hazards, police, and traffic

Made this fun game for rive challenge. My thought process was to push the tool to its limits.
I created components for each item and then using data binding controlled the animation for each instance of the component. I added some classical kitchen simulator touches. Menu is randomly generated. Character outfits are generated randomly as well. Customers get angry over time if not served. Burned buns go to the bin. Burger is served when all the ingredients are added. Hope you enjoy playing it as much as enjoyed making it!

I set out to build a fully functional cyberpunk Game—not just something that looks cool, but something that could actually live inside a real product. I designed and animated everything from the ground up: core components, controllers, interaction logic, motion systems, and responsive behavior.
Throughout the process, I pushed responsiveness and data binding to make sure the entire kit could scale, react, and adapt like a true in-world interface.
And as I like to say: “Make a Rive or step aside.”
Wishing 🎉 everyone the best—because in this challenge, every creator is a winner. 1 27 423 131 Adrian | Vivid Motion Pro For Your SoundCloud 2024, we pushed Rive by creating the first fully interactive Playback Listener Stats experience built entirely in Rive.
Delivering a real-time recap to over 50 million users brought big challenges. We wired engineering pipelines into Rive’s animation tools and used data binding so every screen stayed personalized and fast, embedding it in Soundcloud's native mobile apps, while keeping it all under 13MB which was another big challenge.
Each story worked like its own product, with its own visual style, animations and listener data shaping the result.
The video shows the key screens that shipped, including Top Tracks, Top Moods, Top Artists, Top Genres and Listening Times.
The result reached a global audience, sparked social engagement and raised the bar for SoundCloud recaps. 34 131 4.2K 44 Jonas B. Pro I built Travero to solve a simple problem: we check the weather in two cities, but not along the road between them. 

Most apps show conditions at fixed locations, not what you will actually face while driving. Travero predicts the weather along your entire route and matches each part of the trip to the time you will reach it. This helps you see where rain, snow, fog, or strong wind will appear so you can choose the safest moment to travel. 

The app is designed to feel fully native to iOS with a clean, minimal, and familiar experience. Travero matters because weather is one of the biggest hidden risks in everyday travel. In version 2, the plan is to add smart suggestions for rest areas, hotels, restaurants, and safe stops along the route.

Coming home from work on Friday, I saw someone of a similar age playing a game on their phone and I thought to myself.. 

What if I built a game?

"thinks you're Goated!" is the most surprisingly pleasant notification I have EVER received on social media BUT finding out that, I could tell others they are GOATED too made me Laugh Out Loud! 😂

Goats love climbing but they love community too.. So what if we had a 3D world to chat, vibe and share ideas? This was when a fun game expanded into a digital Third Space that uses proximity voice chat to simulate IRL conversations. A water cooler just for us goats on contra.

If this sounds fun, Upgoat for early access.

You just pick a city, tap a few quick options (your vibe, budget, who you're traveling with), and it auto-generates a clean, personalized itinerary in seconds.
It finds the best spots — cafés, museums, hidden gems, viewpoints, food, everything — and organizes your days so you’re not running all over the city. No research, no chaos, just a cute, smart travel plan that matches your vibe. 🌍✨
Will post on the iOS soon and also share the build, now try to add more features! 7 29 770 169 Chien Pham 7 Days Building a Game UI Kit with @Rive  – My Learning Journey
This is my submission for #rivechallenge.
I spent 7 days creating a game UI kit in Rive as a way to challenge myself and learn more. My goal was to build a UI kit that could actually be used in a product, including UI, interaction, motion, responsive behavior, and data binding.
I started with small components like buttons, then expanded to badges and a few character assets. Throughout the process, I continuously tested responsiveness to ensure the UI kit could function in a real environment, not just as a showcase.
There are still many things I want to improve, but this 7-day challenge helped me understand more about building a product-ready UI kit and refining my workflow with Rive. It’s a small but meaningful step in my learning journey. 36 169 6.5K 72 Chien Pham 7 Days Exploring Interactions with @Rive 
This is my first submission for #rivechallenge.
In the first 2 days, I explored simple character interactions using audio, data binding, and rigging to create a few playful experiences for children.
These were small experiments, but they helped me learn how to combine animation, rigging, and data binding. I’m looking forward to sharing my next experiments with a more complete UI kit. 12 72 1.9K 89 Afeez Yunus Hiya everyone. Here's my submission for the Rive x Contra Challenge. 
A fully playable, vertical slice for a Snake and Ladders game, with all the quirks and features you might expect from the classic. 

In the video, beyond the showcase, I break down what's under the hood and how it's set up. 
I hope you enjoy watching this. Don't forget to like and upvote. 

Cheers! 23 89 3.4K 91 Ana Catita Pro NEW GENERATION OF GREETING CARDS

Hi Contra Riverinos!
For my challenge submission I present you the new generation of greeting cards!
Instead of sending a typical e-card, you can now send an animated, fully interactive greeting card.
We used Data Binding across the file structure to allow change based on user input and preferences, to unite artboards with shared properties, to bind text changed at runtime, image binding for a photo uploader!
View Models were a game changer, making it easy to bring external animations into a base file. Layouts feature ensured every card looks great on any device.
All cards were animated in Rive and I illustrated some myself.
Rather than explain more, I’ll let the video do the talking.

Links ✽ also supports daily routines with quiet hours and automation rules, ensuring a healthy screen time and protected workflows. Each user has a private view, while shared devices are visible to the group.
A fast, human-centered way to manage your screens, clean, real-time, and premium. 5 26 1.2K 34 SAHIL GUPTA APP: 12 Months ⭐

Throughout development, I made extensive use of Rive’s layout, data binding, state machines, and component system to build a fully modular and reactive scene structure. Each animation responds dynamically to user interaction, and Rive’s scene logic runs smoothly within the Unity workflow.
The final build is not only fully playable but also runs reliably across multiple platforms without any issues, demonstrating how stable and flexible the Rive–Unity pipeline can be.
The result is a narrative-driven interactive experience that highlights how Rive’s powerful feature set can enhance game-oriented content.
I’m excited to submit this project to the Rive Challenge! 6 51 1.4K Explore projects Join 50k+ companies and 1M+ independents Hire creatives Get hired Discover hidden jobs in your network Scan thousands of posts in your LinkedIn and X feeds, saving you countless hours.
