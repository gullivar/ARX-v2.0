Find trainers Learn about partnership Trustpilot Trustpilot What Scrum Alliance members say As someone coming from a non-IT/engineering background, I was keen to expand my knowledge of agile methodologies and team collaboration. Scrum Alliance provided the perfect platform for me to achieve these goals. One of the highlights of my learning journey was the supportive and knowledgeable instructors. Their expertise in agile practices and real-world experience brought the concepts to life. They were patient, encouraging, and always willing to answer questions and provide valuable insights. I truly appreciated their dedication to creating an engaging and interactive learning environment. The Scrum Alliance trainer provided me with a comprehensive understanding of scrum, including its principles, roles, artifacts, and events using real-life and practical experiences. Other participants and I gained a solid foundation in scrum practices, and we can apply them effectively in our organizations. I highly recommend the CSM certification from Scrum Alliance to anyone looking to enhance their agile knowledge and become a skilled scrum master. It has been a truly enriching experience that will undoubtedly benefit my career and the teams I work with. Thank you, Scrum Alliance, for offering such a remarkable certification program. I’m incredibly grateful to Scrum Alliance for providing an outstanding platform for scrum certification. The Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM®) certification process was smooth, comprehensive, and highly valuable. The resources and support provided by Scrum Alliance made it easy to gain a deep understanding of scrum principles. Learning scrum through the CSPO certification was a game-changer. It helped me formalize my agile experience and sharpen my ability to prioritize backlogs, define user stories, and deliver value iteratively. I gained practical insights into collaborating with cross-functional teams, refining product vision, and driving outcomes through continuous feedback.
