NYC Says Goodbye To The Iconic MetroCard Transit Pass

After more than three decades, the gold-hued New York City MetroCard is retiring. The last day to buy or refill a MetroCard is Dec. 31, 2025, as the transit system fully transitions to OMNY, a contactless payment system that allows riders to tap their credit card, phone or other smart device to pay fares, much like they do for other everyday purchases.
