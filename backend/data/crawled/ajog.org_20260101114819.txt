Inclusion and Diversity

AJOG values inclusion and diversity  Opens in new window   across research, be it authorship, reviewers, or editors. This is in line with Elsevier’s support of the joint commitment for action on inclusion and diversity in publishing.

We are committed to improving the gender parity and diversity among our editorial teams and publishing papers that advance education about health equity and promote diversity in thoughts and perspectives. Equity and inclusion in publishing is critically important for scientific excellence and innovation. We believe passionately in the power of an inclusive publishing environment, not only to do what is right, but to enrich, strengthen and advance us all.

AJOG's Editors have active research programs and, on occasion, publish work in the Journal. Editor/authors are masked to the peer review process and editorial decision-making of their own work and are not able to access this work in the online manuscript submission system. Work by Editor/authors is assessed using the same criteria as that applied to all AJOG submissions.
