Eaglercraft Minecraft Home Game News Community Downloads Servers* Source* Navigation × Home What is Minecraft? Getting started Credits News Community Downloads Servers* Source* Minecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things. It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It's pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea. You can play Minecraft on PC/Mac/Browser . It can be played in the browser with Eaglercraft, an AOT compiled voxel game inspired from Minecraft designed to run on Javascript. It uses TeaVM and LAX1DUDE's OpenGL emulator to run a Java virtual machine fully compatible with browsers. Eaglercraft can be played on ChromeOS, iOS, Android, and pretty much any device with a web browser; including your smart fridge. So far millions people have played the Browser version of the game.
