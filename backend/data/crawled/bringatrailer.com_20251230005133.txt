BaT Auction Success Story: Unleashing the Wolf

This Success Story comes to us from BaT member SRA59, who won this 2016 Wolf Racing Cars GB08 SM from jcarson72 in an August 2025 BaT auction:

When this BaT listing first appeared before me, it felt like fate. It was for a 2016 Wolf GB08 SM featuring a carbon-fiber tub, a sequential gearbox, and a look that screamed with purpose. The auction page was alive with dreamers and bench racers, but I wasn’t one of them—I was hunting for keeps. The final hour of bidding was a blur filled with heartbeats and refresh clicks. My palms were slick against the keyboard as the bidding climbed. The Wolf had lived its life on circuits I’d only watched online, but I could already envision it unloading under the Texas sun at MotorSport Ranch in Cresson, Texas. It was like hearing the starter drop the flag on a brand-new chapter of my life once the timer hit zero and the listing was marked “sold.”

Yesterday’s comments of note
A few of the comments that stood out to us yesterday:
	

“In 1979 a friend of mine’s brother bought a new first year RX-7. I had the opportunity to drive it. My car was a 1200 cc Corolla. By comparison the RX-7 seemed so fast and handled like it was on rails. In retrospect they only had about 100 hp, but I thought I was in a fire breathing racecar. Fun times!”

 18	JWHBOOMER commented on No Reserve: 18k-Mile 1985 Mazda RX-7 GS 5-Speed
	

“I’d have this strange compulsion to get it running, but that probably illustrates my OCD more than my actual knowledge of this listing’s current value and purpose. To be honest, in all my years I’ve never known anyone to have an outboard motor on display in their home. Motorcycles? Sure. Bikes? Of course. Even Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Shelbys, oh my. Dead center of the living room on most occasions. But an outboard motor? Whoa. And one this cool? Double Whoa.

;^)

GLWTA”

 9	sludgo commented on No Reserve: 1937 Evinrude Elto Pal Outboard
	

“I’m having a stroll down memory lane this morning. My mom owned this 914 for about 33 years. She loved this car and enjoyed thousands of miles behind the wheel. She ran it a few times in the late 70’s and early 80’s in Corvette/Porsche rallies. I cruised the Puyallup loop in it back in high school. Got beat in a drag race against at Mustang. I can share some vintage photos of the car if the new buyer would like them. GLWTA I will be watching fondly. By the way it was originally bronze.”
