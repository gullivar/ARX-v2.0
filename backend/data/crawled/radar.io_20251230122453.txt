In an AI-first world, accurate, real-time geolocation data is a critical input into fraud detection, personalization, automation, and more.

Radar is helping companies take advantage, from restaurants and retail to gaming and logistics and more.

The Radar difference
Unmatched extensibility

Create custom geofences, reports, and rules. Push and pull data from anywhere. Radar adapts to your systems, not the other way around.

Best-in-class performance

Radar processes billions of API calls per day from hundreds of millions of devices, handling massive scale and traffic spikes with best-in-class accuracy and latency.

Faster time to value

Developer-friendly SDKs, docs, and pre-built integrations help even the biggest teams integrate in a single sprint.

Simple, fair, predictable pricing

Do more with geolocation for less. Consolidate and save up to 50% by migrating from legacy geolocation and maps platforms.
