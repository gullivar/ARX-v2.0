What is ada? Get Started Our World Is Changing. Together, We Can Change It For The Better. Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies                 to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems,                 and societies. With a leading team of engineers, Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable                 structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress. A History Of Impossible, Made Possible Use Cardano Apps Benefits Cardano restores trust to global systems – creating, through science, a more secure, transparent, and sustainable foundation for individuals to transact and exchange, systems to govern, and enterprises to grow. Cardano brings a new standard in technology – open and inclusive – to challenge the old and activate a new age of sustainable, globally-distributed innovation. Proof-of-stake and Ouroboros Protocol Evidence-based development Research Secure Transact Incentivized participation Open Scalable and sustainable Ecosystem Proof-Of-Stake And Ouroboros: The Most Environmentally Sustainable Blockchain Protocol Ouroboros is the first peer-reviewed, verifiably-secure blockchain protocol, and Cardano is the first blockchain         to implement it. Ouroboros enables decentralization in the Cardano network on a sustainable scale for global requirements         and most crucially, without compromising security. The protocol is the result of tireless efforts, based on foundational         research, propelled by a vision for more secure and transparent global payment systems, and provides the means to equitably redistribute         power and control.

Make the Change Discover Cardano Cardano is the first blockchain platform to be built through peer-reviewed research ,             to be secure enough to protect the data of billions, scalable enough to accommodate global systems,             and robust enough to support foundational change. People Purpose Research Technology Opportunity We have changed science. We have changed what it means to build global systems and sustainable models of exchange and governance. Alongside the community, entities, and companies building on Cardano, a new future is being defined: a decentralized future without intermediaries, where power is returned to the individual Entities Multiple independent entities collaborate within a decentralized team framework to drive Cardano forward, ensuring that it remains aligned with its core mission as it progresses and develops.
