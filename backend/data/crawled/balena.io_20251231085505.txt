It really feels like balena is a collaborative partner in making our experience successful” Becky Neil Program Manager, Meow Wolf Customer of 6 years “Balena gives us the flexibility to deploy fleets efficiently, and the support is always responsive when we need it.” Garrett Miller Tech Lead, Sight Machine Customer of 5 years “With balena, there’s a level of confidence that they’re making the right decisions and taking the right path in how they communicate and grow their platform. We’re closely aligned and we trust their approach and people.” Pedro Silva Head of Software and IoT, infarm Customer of 3 years “Everything was about scale, reliability, and finding a mature method in the market that was already proven to work.” Kevin Yang Product Lead, Seeed Studio Veteran customer “We went down the road of trying to manipulate Linux ourselves, and we came to the conclusion that balenaCloud was the right platform for us” Reza Hajebi VP of Engineering, Skycatch Customer of 8 years “We can scale much better and handle multiple devices instead of treating them individually - we don’t have to update the devices one by one. Moreover, the API is quite powerful and helps us automate quite a bit of our work. There’s no service we’re aware of that’s comparable.” Flavia Paganelli Co-founder and Director of Engineering, 30MHz balena ambassador “balena is head and shoulders ahead of anyone else when it comes to making software and device management easy” Alex Lennon Partner and Founder, Dynamic Devices Customer of 5 years “Being able to do software related tasks remotely, and managing and deploying to a large installed base are definitely the killer features of balena. This enables a very fast update cycle and therefore is a booster for the overall development speed of our services.” Stefan Rauch Software Engineer, Bosch User since 2018 “balena gave us all the fleet management and OTA stuff that we knew we would need. For example, we’ve got devices deployed across the world now and we can roll out fixes or software updates or support them anywhere in the world sitting from our office in Bristol.” Chris Dyson 15 minutes to create your first fleet of devices 100+ types of devices supported, from Raspberry Pi to x86 to Jetson Orin 200,000 devices in a fleet built by one customer in a year How balena works A complete set of tools to build your fleet Develop Deploy Manage Scale Develop your application Your application runs on a container-optimized OS which is secure, minimal, and purpose-built for remote edge devices Use familiar developer tools Use the language of your choice Choose from 26,000+ IoT-focused base images Test and iterate in seconds with development images Get support developing your application Deploy your application Automatically deploy your application and updates to one device or your entire fleet Push your code to automatically build images in the cloud Optionally, your application can also use your existing Docker images Benefit from application deltas to minimize bandwidth usage and deliver fast updates Learn more about deploying your application Manage your fleet Monitor and manage all your devices remotely Monitor the health of your fleet from your balenaCloud dashboard Troubleshoot devices by viewing logs on your dashboard Access your devices over a secure tunnel directly from your dashboard Easily update the OS on your devices from your dashboard Filter devices depending on your needs and pin them to different releases as needed Learn more about managing your fleet Scale your fleet Balena is proven on fleets of hundreds of thousands of devices Built-in mechanisms for provisioning devices at scale Create specialized development tooling using our API Use our CLI to hook into your existing CI/CD Pricing scales down as you scale up Support for custom carrier boards Try balenaCloud for free Challenges An end-to-end IoT management solution Updating Robust and resilient updates for your fleet, managed remotely using the balenaCloud dashboard.
