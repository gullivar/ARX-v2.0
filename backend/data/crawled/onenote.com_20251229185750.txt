Copilot in OneNote, supercharge your productivity

As your notetaking partner, Copilot in OneNote uses your prompts to draft plans, generate ideas, create lists, organize information, and more.

Sketch, annotate, and highlight freely

OneNote lets you combine the power of digital ink with the natural feel of a pen to help you sketch out your inspirations.

Share and Collaborate

Great minds don't always think alike, but they can share ideas and create together in OneNote.

Never miss a detail with voice transcription

Voice transcription makes it easier than ever to efficiently capture your notes, focus on what's important, and review your content later.

OneNote in Education

Teachers can use OneNote to organize lesson plans in searchable digital notebooks, and staff can create a sharable content library. Encourage students to handwrite notes and sketch diagrams.

Sticky Notes in OneNote

The New Sticky Notes experience is a fresh feature from OneNote to help you remember more seamlessly than ever. With quick capture and automatic recall of the notes when you revisit the same source, remembering what matters just got easier.
