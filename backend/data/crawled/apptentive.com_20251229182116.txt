Apptentive is now Alchemer Mobile
Former Apptentive customers have access to more survey and workflow functionality

The links on this page will take you to Alchemer.com, where you will find the same information you found on Apptentive.com, as well as information about Alchemer and Alchemer’s other products, including Alchemer Survey and Alchemer Workflow.

With this acquisition, former Apptentive customers will continue to enjoy the features that made Apptentive (now Alchemer Mobile) the market-leading mobile feedback platform for mobile-app product managers. Customers will also now have access to survey and workflow functionality across communication channels and within platforms such as Salesforce, Microsoft Teams, and Slack.

Together, we make it easier for our users to close the feedback loop with customers and employees.
