High Density Colocation

Regardless of floor type (raised or slab), any data hall can accommodate high-density colocation by integrating CDUs into the chilled water loop and implementing a secondary water loop for cabinets with rear door heat exchangers or direct chip cooling.

I’ve dealt with really poor suppliers, I’ve dealt with mediocre suppliers, and I’ve dealt with great suppliers. These guys fall into that great supplier category.

Research propels our growth as a leading research university, and partnering with DataBank dramatically improves the performance of our computing environment.

DataBank agreed to build out the first floor of IAD2 for us while working the costs into the lease. This allowed us to spread out our payments and work the cost into our allocated budget. That was a big factor in partnering with DataBank – and their ability to provide liquid cooling at a reasonable cost. Just as important, DataBank gives us a team of experts that can ensure our infrastructure keeps running 24×7.

VIDEO TESTIMONIAL
DataBank is more than just space and power—it’s the people. Their teams are supportive, communicate effectively, take pride in their work, and are genuinely invested in our success. From deployment to ongoing support, they went above and beyond, making our experience seamless. Compared to all the other data centers we work with, we have never experienced this level of excellence.
THOMAS K. SUTER
Manager – Transport Data Centers, Boost Mobile
The references made all the difference. How they spoke about how DataBank treats them and their expertise level was an eye-opener. We were talking to people who truly knew their stuff and could likely manage on their own. The fact that they chose DataBank shows they trust DataBank to do the job right.
BEN BLUM
Director of IT, The New Jewish Home
The move to DataBank was precipitated by the need to deliver peace of mind for our customers, and that came in the form of better security, better performance, and better reliability from DataBank.

Since being with DataBank, nothing keeps me up at night anymore. We use DataBank’s Cloud and the benefit is knowing that their virtualization technology will protect our servers if there’s a hardware failure. I don’t worry about a server dying because I know it will fail over to another server.
