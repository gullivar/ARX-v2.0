This site is exactly what I have been looking for!    I have four children within five years of age and they can all play your games!    I love that you can choose your level of difficulty.  The games are colorful and   simple, not cluttered like some.  The instructions are easy to understand and   they cover basic learning that can be neglected with other "too busy" games.   I   can't believe what a blessing it is to have stumbled upon this site!  I looked   up "kindergarten math games online."  This is the first one that I actually   enjoyed navigating around in and that actually kept the kids' attention without   discouraging them. This site will be a daily part of our learning!    The kids were fighting over who could take the next turn at the learning game!    It is reinforcing everything I am trying to teach.
