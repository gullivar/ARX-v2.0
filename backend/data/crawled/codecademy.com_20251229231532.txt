Quote by Shabana Khatau, Systems and Applications Advisor from London, England
I wasted quite a bit of time before learning about Codecademy. Anyone who would come up to me, I would direct them straight to Codecademy. Don’t waste any time on anyone else; just start there.​

Quote by Jimmy Soto, SOC Security Specialist from Washington, DC - Baltimore
Codecademy played into the whole gamification aspect because of how user-friendly it is and the completion of courses and modules. Completing a module felt like an achievement, and it helped me have a pathway to dive into cybersecurity, coming from a completely different world.​
