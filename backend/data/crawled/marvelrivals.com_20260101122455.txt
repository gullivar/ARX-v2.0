K'un-Lun: Heart of Heaven As the Timestream Entanglement spreads throughout different dimensions, the mystical city of K'un-Lun was certainly no exception. Time trickles by in this land riddled with ancient Chinese architecture, but something is amiss. The Immortal Dragon and protector of the city, Shou-Lao, has slipped into an eternal slumber, leaving K'un-Lun vulnerable and facing conflicts like never before. With K'un-Lun on the brink of exposure, Doctor Doom schemes to seize the Heart of Shou-Lao. Iron Fist now leads his people to defend their homeland, but awakening Shou-Lao comes with its risks.

      within the planet's core. After the decaying body of the Celestial slain by Knull plummeted from orbit, the land
      grew to absorb its ancient power.
      Can you navigate the shifting terrain and stop the dark god before he snuffs out the light?
      Step into the abyss and face the darkness! HELLFIRE GALA:ARAKKO Long before they were sister nations on the surfaces of neighboring planets, the living islands known as Krakoa
      and Arakko were both part of one giant Mutant landmass called Okkara. Thousands of years ago, Okkara split itself
      in half to protect Earth from extra-dimensional demonic threats. Even when the danger had finally passed, the two
      islands were reluctant to rejoin each other. However, after Ultron assimilated Arakko and its Mutant population,
      it seemed that the only way to purge his virus and restore Arakko to its former glory was for the infected island
      to rejoin Krakoa and become whole again. HELLFIRE GALA: KRAKOA The 2099 Hellfire Gala is underway, and Emma Frost is dazzling in her finery, expertly mingling with the crowd.
      With guests being properly entertained and the Mutants’ guards down, the timing is perfect for Ultron to crash

      threatens the ever-lasting prosperity of this kingdom and all of the Ten Realms. EMPIRE OF ETERNAL NIGHT: MIDTOWN Midtown has fallen into eternal night, overrun by Dracula and his bloodthirsty legions. Iconic landmarks like the
      Baxter Building and Grand Central Terminal have become battlegrounds in the fight for survival.

      Heroes must navigate the twisted streets and uncover the secrets lurking in the heart of the darkness. EMPIRE OF ETERNAL NIGHT: SANCTUM SANCTORUM Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum stands as the last beacon of hope in a city consumed by darkness. Protected by
      ancient wards and powerful magic, it serves as a refuge for those battling the chaos unleashed by Dracula and his
      legion.

      forces.

      time falls apart, that chaos will usher in a new era for the evil organization...

      Beneath Charteris Base in Antarctica, Hydra has reawakened a gateway to its otherworldly deity, and the key is the

      the homeland of that very mound.

      But no matter how far it's technology advances, Wakanda's strength will always be its people. Wakanda Forever! TOKYO 2099: SPIDER-ISLANDS Take a journey above Tokyo 2099 into the Web of Life and Destiny!

      To patch up the temporal rift, the Master Weaver is working around the clock to spin his magic while also
      suspending an entire network of islands aloft, far above from the urban hustle. As a lover of time, he's preserved
      many more classic Japanese elements, from zen gardens to his own sacred tenshu, where he protects a personal
      sliver of the Web of Life and Destiny itself.
