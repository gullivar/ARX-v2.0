I’ll look back at key developments and notable products launched in 2025, share some CNX Software website traffic statistics, and look ahead to 2026. Year 2025 in Review After 22 product releases in 2024, Raspberry Pi calmed down a little bit in 2025, and the highlights of the year included the Raspberry Pi 500+ mechanical keyboard, the 5-inch variant of the Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2, and a Raspberry Pi 5 1GB RAM. What didn’t quite stop were the accessories from third parties for Raspberry Pi SBC and Raspberry Pi Pico boards. The most exciting Arm SoC release of 2025 was probably the 12-core CIX P1 Armv9 SoC found in Radxa Orion O6 SBC, MINISFORUM MS-R1 Arm mini PC, and Orange Pi 6 Plus board, but while performance was fine, it was overhyped in 2024, and software […] Posted on December 31, 2025 December 31, 2025 by Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft) - 2 Comments on VisionFive 2 Lite SBC Review – Ubuntu 24.04 on a low-cost RISC-V SBC in 2026 VisionFive 2 Lite SBC Review – Ubuntu 24.04 on a low-cost RISC-V SBC in 2026 StarFive has sent me a sample of the VisionFive 2 Lite RISC-V SBC for review. It’s a low-cost credit card-sized board based on the StarFive JH7110S quad-core RISC-V SBC and designed to get started with Linux RISC-V on the cheap. When I first tested the earlier VisionFive 2 SBC with a StarFive JH7110 RISC-V SoC in February 2023, I didn’t call it a review, but rather a hands-on experience, since, at the time, many features still didn’t work properly. Almost three years have passed since then, so reviewing the VisionFive 2 Lite SBC with Ubuntu 24.04 will allow us to see how much progress has been made on the software side. If you are in a rush, you can jump to the what works, what doesn’t section. VisionFive 2 Lite unboxing I received the board in a plastic box with a cover reading “VisionFive 2 Lite Your Gateway to RISC-V”.

It is the next generation of HUSKYLENS, an AI vision sensor equipped with a Kendryte K230 dual-core RISC-V SoC with a 6 TOPS AI accelerator and a 2.4-inch IPS touchscreen. The device runs machine vision algorithms fully on-device, providing fast and low-latency performance, and includes more than 15 built-in AI models. HUSKYLENS 2 also supports deploying custom-trained models, including integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) via a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service. In addition, it is compatible with various microcontrollers, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, through UART or I2C communication interfaces. HUSKYLENS 2 unboxing The manufacturer sent the HUSKYLENS 2 module and the Microscope Lens separately. Both parcels were shipped from Chengdu, China, and arrived at my office in Chanthaburi, Thailand, in about one week. The parcels were packed in standard cardboard boxes and arrived […] Posted on December 30, 2025 December 30, 2025 by Debashis Das - 5 Comments on Add four Gigabit or 2.5Gbps Ethernet ports to the Raspberry Pi 5 with this expansion board Add four Gigabit or 2.5Gbps Ethernet ports to the Raspberry Pi 5 with this expansion board Waveshare PCIE TO 4-CH Gigabit/2.5G ETH Board (B) is a 4-port Gigabit or 2.5 Gbps Ethernet board designed for the Raspberry Pi 5. This board connects four RJ45 ports to the Pi’s 16-pin PCIe interface and also includes a mounting option for the Pi5 Connector Adapter (C). The only limiting factor is the Pi’s PCIe Gen2/Gen3 x1 interface, as the 2.5GbE ports share the available bandwidth and cannot operate at full speed simultaneously. The Gigabit Ethernet variant features Realtek RTL8153 USB to Ethernet controllers, while the 2.5GbE variant relies on RTL8156 controllers, and both integrate a VL805 PCIe to USB bridge chip. The board also includes status LEDs for link and activity indication, and draws power directly from the PCIe interface without requiring an external power supply. The device is plug-and-play and supports Raspberry Pi OS out of the box with no additional drivers required. Applications include routers, firewalls, network […] Posted on December 30, 2025 by Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft) - 5 Comments on Rockchip RK1820/RK1828 SO-DIMM and M.2 LLM/VLM AI accelerator modules, devkits, and benchmarks Rockchip RK1820/RK1828 SO-DIMM and M.2 LLM/VLM AI accelerator modules, devkits, and benchmarks Rockchip unveiled two RK182X LLM/VLM accelerators at its developer conference last July, namely the RK1820 with 2.5GB RAM for 3B parameter models, and the RK1828 with 5GB RAM for 7B parameter models. A few months have passed, and we have a few more details since a development kit based on Rockchip RK1820/RK1828 SO-DIMM module is now available, some basic documentation has been released, and the RK1828 has been benchmarked against the Rockchip RK3588’s NPU. I was also told that M.2 modules are coming soon. Firefly RK182X 3D RAM Stacking Development Kit The “RK182X 3D RAM Stacking Development Kit” is based on the AIO-GS1N2 carrier board, previously offered with a Rockchip RK3576 or RK3588(s) and with a NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano or NX AI module.
