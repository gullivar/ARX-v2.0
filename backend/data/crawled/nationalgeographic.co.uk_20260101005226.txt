2025: The Pictures of the Year

From the thousands of images made by our photographers all around the world this year, we present the ones that moved and inspired us most.

2025: Year in Review

From iconic images to medical breakthroughs, revisit the highlights of the past year.

Limitless with Chris Hemsworth

Chris Hemsworth takes on three epic challenges to explore science-backed ways to improve our health. He learns to drum for a brain-boosting, surprise stadium gig, climbs a frozen 600-foot wall to explore the benefits of breaking out of our comfort zones, and embraces brutal Special Forces pain training in South Korea—all to discover how we can live longer, better lives.
