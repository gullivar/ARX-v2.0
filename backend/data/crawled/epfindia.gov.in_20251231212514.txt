About Us EPFO ranks among the globe's premier Social Security Organizations, distinguished by its vast clientele and the magnitude of financial transactions it manages. At present it maintains 29.88 crore accounts ( Annual Report 2022-23 ) pertaining to its members. The inception of the Employees' Provident Fund dates back to the enactment of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance on November 15, 1951, which was subsequently replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act of 1952. This legislative journey began with the introduction of the Employees' Provident Funds Bill in Parliament as Bill Number 15 of 1952, aimed at establishing provident funds for employees across factories and other establishments. Over time, this legislation evolved into the Employees' Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952 , applicable nationwide in India. The administration of this Act and its associated schemes falls under the purview of a tripartite body known as the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) , Employees' Provident Fund. The CBT comprises representatives from various sectors, including the government (both central and state), employers, and employees. The CBT administers three schemes – Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme 1952, Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) 1995 and Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) Scheme 1976 for the workforce engaged in the organized sector in India. The Board is assisted by the Employees’ PF Organization (EPFO), consisting 147 offices across the country ( EPFO's Organisation Structure ).The EPFO is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India ( click here 14-07-2015 ).
