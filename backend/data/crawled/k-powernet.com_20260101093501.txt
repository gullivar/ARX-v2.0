K-PowerNet was created to market a fiber optic system constructed to meet the communications needs of KAMO Power and its’ member cooperative distribution systems. Fiber optic cable has been installed which link all of our communications sites together. Because of this, we are able to utilize what we need and market the remainder, enabling broadband internet and state-of-the-art telecommunications services to rural areas in the four states. Our History We are not new to the telecommunications industry. We have been meeting the telecom and technology needs of electric utilities for more than 45 years. We have been operating microwave and other wireless systems since the 1960s and installed our first fiber-optic system in 1979. We have always operated with a single objective in mind -- the highest reliability at the lowest cost.
