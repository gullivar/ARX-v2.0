Welcome to Onekopakaspace!

Onekopakaspace is not a normal website. Onekopakaspace is a small, quaint community of experienced computer users, programmers, gamers, and some that are a mix of all of those.

Onekopakaspace had long been home-hosted, but no longer is. With its start on an HP Pavilion desktop, and its revival on a Mac mini, it has found another new life on a VPS in Las Vegas.

We operate several game servers, most notably Minecraft.
