About (TOS, Privacy Policy)
We run nodes of multiple EVM networks (and with Bitcoin, Monero) as a public good.
We now run full nodes for EVM chains by default, which is capable of deriving historic transactions receipts and contract events (like eth_getTransactionReceipt or eth_getLogs)
Our endpoints are rate limited with less than 10 ~ 20 calls allowed per second so please use it wisely! (The limits are included with batch requests as well)
We don’t store any sent data nor any raw IPs. Refer /privacy for more info.
No tracking of any kind.
Open issues on https://github.com/0xRPC/0xRPC.github.io/issues for any inquiries / bug reports on RPC.
