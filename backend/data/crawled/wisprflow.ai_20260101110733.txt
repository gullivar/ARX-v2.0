Also, I told the team the the new timeline should be ready by Friday, although it’s probably going to slip. There’s been a lot of back and forth and honestly the the whole thing’s been kind of chaotic, like nobody really knows what’s going on so can you check in with them and see if the notes from yesterday’s meeting were sent out, or if they’re still waiting. I think Cheyene mentioned it but didn’t confirm, and now I’m a little lost. Hope your week is off to a good start. I was talking to Cheyene earlier, but the reception was really bad.
