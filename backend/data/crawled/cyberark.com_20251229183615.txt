Secure identities.
Shut out attackers.

Seamlessly secure identities throughout the cycle of accessing any resource across any infrastructure, including hybrid, SaaS and multi-cloud. The CyberArk identity security platform is the first line of defense against malicious actors and unauthorized access to protect what matters most.

Seamless & secure access for all identities

By combining secure SSO, Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Directory Services and User Behavior Analytics, we help you streamline operations and give users simple and secure access to resources—on-premises, cloud, hybrid—from any location, using any device.

Intelligent privilege controls

Apply world-class intelligent privilege controls across the IT estate, as well as differentiated controls to secure the unique needs of workforce users, third-party vendors, endpoints and machine identities as they access sensitive data.

Flexible identity automation & orchestration

Streamline HR processes, ensure users have the right access to the right resources, enable compliance with industry or government regulations, and improve efficiencies across the board with orchestration and lifecycle management, permissions and entitlements, and directory and federation services.

Identity Security Defined

Centered on intelligent privilege controls, identity security seamlessly secures access for all identities and flexibly automates the identity lifecycle with continuous threat detection and prevention — all with a unified approach.

Explore the Platform

Apply intelligent privilege controls across the entire identity lifecycle
Expand intelligent privilege controls that were designed for the most privileged user, such as an admin, to a broader range of human and machine identities, whenever standing or just-in-time access is required.

Workforce & Customer Access

Ensure that the right users have secure access to the right resources at the right times, by protecting workforce and customer credentials and tightly controlling access to on-premises and cloud-based applications, services and IT infrastructure.

Endpoint Privilege Security

Take control over unmanaged privilege on the endpoints to significantly reduce the area of attack and defend from threats by removing local admin rights, enforcing role-specific least privilege and improving audit-readiness.

Secure privileged credentials and secrets with comprehensive capabilities for operating systems, endpoints, cloud infrastructure and workloads, servers, databases, applications, hypervisors, network devices, security appliances and more.

Learn More

Secrets Management

Secure and manage the secrets and credentials used by applications, machines and other non-human identities to access IT and other sensitive resources across both enterprise and external IT environments.

Learn More

Cloud Security

Extend privilege controls to cloud environments by analyzing, securing and monitoring access. Discover and remove excessive permissions by visualizing access for human, machine and federated identities.

Learn More
