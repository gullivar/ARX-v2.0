How We Test and Recommend Products on TripSavvy

Our team of experienced travel writers and editors scours the retail landscape (both online and off) to find the best products. And to make sure you’re getting the best recommendations, we test thousands of products a year—both in our 10,000-square-foot lab testing space in Brooklyn and out in the world, testing products the same way you would use them.
