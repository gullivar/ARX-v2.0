This is also the coronation church where some of the most significant people in Britain's history are buried or commemorated. Discover our history The King Charles III Sacristy We're constructing a new building - named in honour of HM The King - to transform the welcome we offer to the millions of people who come to the Abbey to enjoy one of the world’s great churches. Follow the project Shop at the Abbey Discover our online shop. Every purchase supports our work.

We are independent and receive no funding from the Church, the Government or, the Crown. So, your help really counts.
