Add a transit agency with a supported API (such as GTFS-RT) for $20 (includes 6-month premium user). I have suspended adding new American transit agencies due to the US government threats against Canada. Add a transit agency with an API that TransSee doesn't currently support for $100 (includes 2-year premium user). A source of data with real-time vehicle locations is required. Provide predictions and data for your app using a NextBus API compatible system or customized feed. Business Services TransSee provides prediction data for the RIPTA Downtown Transit Connector with Imperatives, Inc. providing the digital signs. TransSee generates a custom vehicle tracking report for Pattison Outdoor that gives a deeper understanding of which ads are currently running and where. TransSee has provided prediction, data collection and analysis services to transit agencies and researchers, including the Toronto Region Board of Trade Transit Report Cards . TransSee is capable of being the official app for a transit agency. Feel free to email me about these options.
