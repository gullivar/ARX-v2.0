Today I'm glad to announce we will be starting the 2nd tournament of CubeCraft League! For those who don't know, CubeCraft League is an official tournament space for our community by our staff team. We host tournaments with prizes for the top 3, so gather your best team and play for the win! Now, let's go over some things we need to know for this tournament. Games We will be playing BedWars 4v4 for our Java platform, and 5v5 Capture the Flag for our Bedrock platform. For BedWars modifiers, Faster Generators will be the standard practice. For Capture the Flag modifiers, Rush Mode will be the standard practice. Some important notes for Capture the Flag: Iron and diamond generators will not exist in Capture the Flag league matches. If the match ends in a tie, the team with the most captured flags across all games will be the winner. If the game is still tied, a 2v2 tiebreaker round will be played after the third game. Only 2 players from each team will participate in the tiebreaker round. Map Pool New tournament means new map pools! Let's take a small look, shall we?
