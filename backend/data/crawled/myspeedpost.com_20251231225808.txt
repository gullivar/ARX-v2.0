Disclaimer: This website is not endorsed by or affiliated with India Post About India Postal Service History The history of the India Postal Service is a journey that traverses
        centuries. In its earliest form, messages were conveyed through an
        intricate system of foot messengers and the use of animals like pigeons.
        The British East India Company laid the foundation for modern postal
        services in India when they established postal systems in Bombay,
        Madras, and Calcutta in the 18th century. The year 1854 marked a
        significant milestone with the introduction of a comprehensive postal
        system across the country. This momentous event signified the birth of
        India Post as we know it today. A Sprawling Network: India Post has achieved remarkable expansion and outreach. Its network
        is nothing short of astonishing, boasting over 150,000 post offices
        across the length and breadth of India. These post offices are situated
        in urban centers, rural villages, and remote regions, ensuring that
        postal services reach every nook and corner of the country. This
        extensive network serves as the backbone of communication and
        connectivity for a diverse nation with varying geographical challenges. Diverse Range of Services: India Post offers an extensive array of services that cater to the
        multifaceted needs of a nation as diverse as India. Traditional services
        like mail delivery, parcel post, and express delivery are complemented
        by modern offerings such as electronic money transfer, mobile banking,
        and online tracking. Philately, the study and collection of postage
        stamps, is actively promoted, and India Post issues a wide range of
        stamps to commemorate India's rich heritage and culture. Types of Mail service provided by India Post The primary function of Post Office is collection, processing,

                if registration is required, must be prepaid. Postage stamps should
                be attached to the parcel's cover, or impressions from a stamping
                machine can be imprinted. Alternatively, an official label,
                available at the post office without charge, can be utilized. When
                postage stamps are employed, the sender or their representative must
                personally affix the stamps, as postal officials are explicitly
                prohibited from doing so. In the case of using an official label, it
                should be securely adhered to the parcel. If the sender doesn't
                undertake this task personally, it is advisable to ensure it is
                carried out in their presence at the post office before departure. Note: In instances where wax-cloth is employed as an outer
                protective covering, and if robust paper has not been adequately
                secured on the exterior of the wax-cloth (refer to clause 15), it is
                recommended to affix postage stamps exclusively to an official
                label. Manner of Posting All parcels, including service parcels, that are meant for postal
                transmission, must be submitted at the post office window. If a
                parcel is discovered in a letter box, it will be handled and billed
                as a registered parcel. Additionally, if a parcel contains any items
                listed in sub-clauses (2) and (3) of clause 147, as well as clauses

                    window during the designated hours for posting insured articles. Any errors or mistakes should be pointed out immediately by the sender; otherwise, the Post Office
                    will not be liable for damages or compensation. The sender of the insured article is entitled to obtain, free of charge, an acknowledgement of its
                    delivery signed by the addressee or their authorized agent. The sender may personally complete the form of acknowledgment to be signed by the addressee and is
