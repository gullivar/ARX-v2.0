The platform does not store, host, distribute, or
        provide access to any content from Usenet. We supply XML metadata files only and do not offer Usenet access. We do
        not upload or publish anything to Usenet, don't process content requests, and cannot alter or remove material that
        appears on Usenet in any form. All indexed data comes from public external servers that we don't own, don't operate,
        don't manage, and cannot control in any legal or technical way. NZB Finder operates like a search engine. Any claim
        to the contrary would be incorrect.
