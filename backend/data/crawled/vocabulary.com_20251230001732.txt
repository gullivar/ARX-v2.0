Vocabulary.com works through synonyms, antonyms, and sentence usage. It makes students learn the word for life, not just regurgitate it for a test and then purge it from their memory.

We have seen an increase in the Vocabulary Acquisition scores on the NWEA MAP testing. This has led to greater reading comprehension simply from understanding more words.
