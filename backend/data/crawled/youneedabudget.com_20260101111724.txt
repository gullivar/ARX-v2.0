I realized that money was a tool that would help me create my dream life.

YNAB truly helped me buy freedom from a toxic relationship, the flexibility to spend time with my kids, and the ability to pursue my biggest dreams.

Kathryn
YNABer since 2015

I went from living paycheck to paycheck, to having $42K saved in one year.

YNAB has removed the stress of money from my life and in doing so has helped make me a better husband. It's like I got to remove a personal flaw I had never been able to fix.

Kyle
YNABer since 2020

I slayed $30K of debt, reclaimed my freedom, and now I’m living wild and free.

I now live a life of empowered spending and am headed for an early retirement, knowing I’ll never have to compromise my values for a paycheck.
