What’s in a Premium Domain Name?

When it comes to selecting your domain name you should not have to settle. Premium domain names are short, memorable and indispensable in today’s competitive online business world.

Your website is the face of your business and a premium domain will boost your web presence as it generates interest and drives traffic to your site.

Paul Graham on the Importance of Domain Names

"The problem with not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness. Unless you're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain suggests you're a marginal company."

Paul Graham, renowned programmer, writer, investor, and co-founder of Y Combinator.

Advantages of a Premium Domain Name
Immediate Online Presence

When you buy a premium domain you are also making an investment in powerful branding capabilities and the potential to generate a large volume of traffic to your site.

A simple domain name is easy to recall and can be instantly associated with the service or product offered by your business.

Increased Traffic Potential

The instant brand you acquire with your premium domain name can help generate traffic from internet users who are unfamiliar with your business.

When your website is associated with a straightforward domain name, customers will be directed to your site when they type a related product or service in a web browser.

Search Engine Ranking

Your domain name can have a noticeable impact on how your website is listed by search engines.

The more basic and identifiable your domain name is with related search queries the more likely it is to be ranked higher in the search results.
