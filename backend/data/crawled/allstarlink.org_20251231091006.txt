Welcome to AllStarLink! AllStarLink is a network of Amateur Radio repeaters, remote base stations and hot spots accessible
        to each other via Voice over Internet Protocol. AllStarLink runs on a dedicated computer (including the
        Raspberry Pi) that you host at your home, radio site or computer center. It is based on the open source
        Asterisk PBX running our app_rpt application. App_rpt makes Asterisk a powerful system capable of
        controlling one or more radios. It provides linking of these radio "nodes" to other systems of similar
        construction anywhere in the world via VoIP. AllStarLink's primary use is as a dedicated computer node wired to your repeater or radio. Connections from
        Echolink, other VoIP clients and telephone calls are supported. AllStarLink has 0 users and nodes. Help Support ASL The implementation of this system and its monthly upkeep is very costly. Any
          monetary help that you can and wish to give will be much appreciated. Allstarlink Inc. is a 501(c)(3)
          non-profit organization. Donate ASL News From the AllStarLink Board of Directors August 17, 2025 On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to graciously thank all the volunteers and donors; especially those who have set up recurring donations. Without them, none of this would be possible. The unpaid AllStarLink Board of Directors and volunteers have been busy overseeing the daily operations of the AllStarLink network.  It is worth noting, AllStarLink network availability is over 99.99%. Over the last four years, AllStarLink has seen phenomenal growth.  Four years ago, approximately 2,000 nodes were logged into our servers at any one time.  We are now seeing more than 10,000 nodes.  This growth has brought increased expenses and we are currently running at an operational deficit.  We could really use your help. If you find value in the AllStarLink service, we are asking for a voluntary donation of $12/yr per node to help us maintain and improve the AllStarLink eco-system.  For those wishing to support our ongoing efforts please see our 501(c)3 donations page at AllStarLink | Donate As you may have heard, we have some exciting news.  With a generous grant from the ARDC, last year, we released ASL 3.  It is the first new client in 15 years for AllStarLink.  ASL 3 has been redesigned to run on Asterisk 22 LTS with the latest version of Debian 12 Linux and modern hardware.  This is a significant update from the current clients running Asterisk Version 1.4.  The new version incorporates over 15 years of Asterisk bug fixes, major security improvements, and enhancements.  The update required “app_rpt”, the Asterisk application that is Allstar, to be heavily modified.  Many memory leaks have been addressed, modules now load or refresh more reliably, and many bugs have been squashed.  All of this adds up to improved stability and uptime.  We recommend that all users of AllStarLink upgrade their appliances, PC’s and Raspberry Pi’s to use the latest version of ASL 3. Over 3,700 nodes have already upgraded and are currently using ASL 3.  This includes nodes using Raspberry Pi’s 3, 4’s or 5’s (many that had been running Hamvoip), x86_64/AMD PCs and cloud nodes, Kits4Hams SHARI boxes, Node-Ventures ClearNodes, Repeater Builder, and Hotspot Radios. To learn more, visit the ASL3 Manual or log into the AllStarLink Community .  You can also view how-to videos here . If you are using a hotspot appliance, we recommend contacting the hardware manufacturer for specific upgrade instructions. We are also looking for volunteers; especially developers with PHP/Laravel and JavaScript experience.  If you have these skill sets and are willing to help, please reach out to us at volunteer@allstarlink.net.
