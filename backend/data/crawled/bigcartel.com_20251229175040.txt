What I love about selling my jewelry through Big Cartel is how easy each step, from designing my store front to listing products and managing orders, has been and continues to be. It takes all the hassle out of it, so I can spend more time doing the thing I like the most - making jewelry.

The thing that I've always valued the most about the Big Cartel experience is the high quality customer service that they provide. I've been working with them for well over a decade, and everyone that I've ever dealt with has always been helpful, professional, and kind. And that means a lot.
