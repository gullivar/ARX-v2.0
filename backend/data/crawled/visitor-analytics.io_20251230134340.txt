Visitor Behavior Analytics — Stop Guessing How People Interact With Your Site

Enrich your core statistics with:

Event TrackingSession Recordings
Alarming Behavior Tracking
Page HeatmapsConversion Funnels

Most analytics tools show you numbers, not what’s really happening. TWIPLA turns every click, hover, and scroll into intuitive Heatmaps, so you can finally see what content drives action — and what doesn’t.

Watch real visitors scroll, struggle, and drop off in Session Recordings with seamless playback, text-protected views, and powerful action and event filters that expose issues no metric can reveal.

Use Conversion Funnels to stop losing visitors in the dark. Track every step they take — from URLs to in-page actions — and pinpoint the exact level where they quit. With up to 14 funnel levels and linked replays of dropouts, no friction point goes unnoticed.

Still in the dark about why people bounce? Event Tracking reveals what clicks, purchases, and field interactions actually happen — and what’s being ignored.

And with Alarming Behavior Events, catch red flags before they cost you. Track frustration signals like rage clicks, dead clicks, u-turns, and rapid reloads to diagnose UX flaws, stop silent friction, and recover lost revenue.

These tools don’t just work in isolation. They combine to expose every blind spot. Link Session Recordings, Event Tracking, and Conversion Funnels to uncover the full truth of why visitors don’t convert.
