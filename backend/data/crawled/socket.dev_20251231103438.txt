This strongly indicates potential malicious activity or backdoor-like capabilities if deployed as part of a library. Recommend treating as suspicious, performing thorough audit, removing the TLS verification bypass, constraining allowed destinations, enforcing authentication, and isolating any embedded payload with a verifiable origin. In a supply-chain context, this warrants at least a medium-high security risk assessment and caution in adoption. mtlibs 0.0.296 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket This module implements a command-and-control agent: it establishes a Tor connection to a hardcoded .onion C2, downloads a payload, writes it to a temporary file, sets it executable, and runs it — all without validation — and provides a POST endpoint for C2 communication. These are canonical backdoor behaviors (remote code execution, persistence, and concealed C2). Treat the code as malicious: do not execute, block the domain, and investigate any systems where this package or its parent repository was installed or run. cuckoo 2.0.4.2 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket The code implements functionality that can exfiltrate arbitrary files and logs over the network without encryption or user consent. This behavior constitutes a significant security risk and matches malware patterns related to data theft. Although the code is not obfuscated and does not contain explicit malware payloads like backdoors or reverse shells, the potential for unauthorized data leakage is high. Use of this code in a supply chain context should be carefully controlled and audited. cl-lite 1.0.906 by michael_tian Live on npm Blocked by Socket The source code is contains embedded inappropriate adult content with numerous external image links. It is not valid or functional software code. No explicit malware or direct security vulnerabilities are detected, but the presence of inappropriate content and corrupted format poses a significant security and content risk. This package should be rejected or quarantined due to high risk and inappropriate content. github.com/milvus-io/milvus v0.10.3-0.20211003005155-3c8fc9190c4e Live on Go Modules Blocked by Socket This code implements an insecure, unauthenticated RPC mechanism that allows remote clients to cause arbitrary code execution and exfiltrate files/system information. Using pickle over an untrusted network and invoking methods by client-supplied names are severe supply-chain/backdoor risks. Do not deploy or reuse this code in production; it should be treated as a backdoor/untrusted remote-execution component unless wrapped with strong authentication, authorization, sandboxing, and safe serialization. omnibus 0.0.15 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket This module intentionally exposes a full, unauthenticated interactive Python REPL over a Unix-domain socket. That design yields direct in-process arbitrary code execution and broad access to the host process globals and resources. It should be treated as a high security risk: avoid shipping or enabling this in production, restrict socket access with filesystem permissions, add authentication/authorization, or remove the feature. If discovered in a deployed system, treat it as a potential backdoor and investigate connections and created socket files. qg-toolkit 1.1.12 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket The script collects sensitive user information from the Discord API, including usernames, emails, and IDs, and saves it to a file without user consent. It automates interactions with Discord, including sending unsolicited messages to channels (spamming), and uses a captcha solving service to bypass security measures. The script contains hardcoded API keys and tokens, posing significant security risks if shared or leaked. Additionally, it includes obfuscated JavaScript code to manipulate local storage tokens, suggesting attempts to hijack or misuse user accounts. mtmai 0.3.1546 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket This fragment intends to install and start KasmVNC by running many shell commands that create certs, write VNC password files, adjust group membership, and launch a VNC server. The primary security issues are unsafe shell interpolation (command injection risk), programmatic persistence of a possibly predictable password, execution with sudo based on unvalidated env vars, starting a VNC server exposed on 0.0.0.0 with disabled/basic auth, and multiple unsafe filesystem operations performed via shell. There is no clear evidence of obfuscated or direct exfiltration malware, but the behavior can provide an unauthorized remote access vector (backdoor-like) if used maliciously. Do not run this code without fixing shell usage, validating inputs, using secure randomly generated passwords, enforcing proper file permissions, and not disabling authentication. azure-graphrbac 12.24.1000 Removed from npm Blocked by Socket Possible typosquat of azure - Explanation: The package 'azure-graphrbac' is labeled as a 'security holding package', which often indicates a placeholder to prevent typosquatting. The name 'azure-graphrbac' closely resembles legitimate Azure package naming conventions, which could confuse users. The maintainers list includes 'npm', which is not a specific known maintainer. Therefore, it is likely a typosquat. Live on npm for 6 hours and 32 minutes before removal. Socket users were protected even while the package was live. systoring 0.1.2 Removed from PyPI Blocked by Socket The code exhibits characteristics of a stealer malware, designed to extract and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from the user's system. The presence of SQL queries for browser data and paths to cryptocurrency wallets indicates a high risk of data theft. Live on PyPI for 2 hours and 31 minutes before removal. Socket users were protected even while the package was live. vite-react-chunker 2.0.6 by natin933 Live on npm Blocked by Socket This module reaches out at startup to two hardcoded endpoints (https://api[.]npoint[.]io/45ae4382694fffe31eed and https://json-project-opal[.]vercel[.]app/apikey/ZIOBBPJ577T22HML), fetches a JSON payload, and if a “model” field is present it immediately evaluates it as JavaScript via new Function('require', payload)(require). That grants any remotely supplied code full access to Node’s require (and thus the file system, network, child processes, etc.), creating an untrusted backdoor. There is no integrity check, content validation, signature verification, sandboxing, or user consent, and even error responses from the last URL are executed if they contain a “model” field. Hardcoded credentials (API key, UUID) and domain‐fragment concatenation are used to obscure the target hosts. tx-engine 0.6.2 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket The code contains a critical security flaw: untrusted input can be executed via eval(op), enabling arbitrary code execution. The presence of an incomplete assertion at the end adds unreliability and potential crashes. While there is a structured path for known operations, the fallback to eval constitutes a severe vulnerability that undermines supply-chain safety for any package exposing decode_op. Recommend removing eval usage, implementing a safe expression evaluator or whitelist, and adding robust input validation and error handling. servextools 0.1.8 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket The code implements a replication-queue mechanism for MongoDB collections. It does not contain obvious remote-exfiltration, cryptomining, or backdoor network connections. However, it uses eval() to convert string-encoded arguments coming from queued DB documents into Python objects before calling replica operations. This is a high-risk code-execution vector: any attacker or process that can insert or tamper with queue/error documents (or cause untrusted strings to be persisted) can execute arbitrary Python code in the process and then cause arbitrary actions on the replica DB. Other issues are some implementation bugs (non-returning __getattr__) and broad exception handling. Recommend removing eval(), replacing it with safe parsing (json), validating queued data, and ensuring only trusted code writes to the queue/error collections. nuget cipherlabz.biscare.core 1.0.9 by CipherLabz (pvt) Ltd Live on NuGet Blocked by Socket This module contains explicit malicious and destructive functionality. The WatchDog component implements environment-aware destructive actions: deleting repository/build directories and encrypting many file types using a hardcoded password, and it reports environment and events to a hardcoded remote webhook. License validation uses network requests that include the license in Basic auth and persists licence data in HKLM. These behaviors are consistent with sabotage/ransomware rather than harmless licensing checks. The package should be treated as malicious and not used. smartchart 6.9.6 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket The source code is heavily obfuscated and uses exec to run potentially harmful code. This behavior is typical of malicious software, posing a significant security risk. The lack of detailed reports prevents further analysis, but the code's behavior warrants high scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. esoftplay 0.0.96-v by danang Live on npm Blocked by Socket This script performs unsolicited data exfiltration: it watches local config files and sends them to a remote Telegram chat using a hardcoded bot token and chat id when a change is detected. That behavior is high-risk and effectively a backdoor for leaking sensitive configuration data. Treat this code as malicious in intent, remove it, and rotate any exposed credentials. Additionally, avoid using execSync with unescaped interpolated values and avoid embedding secrets in source. hacon 0.9.1 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket This module is an offensive network tool (scanning, WordPress enumeration, packet sniffing, DoS, ARP poisoning). It contains multiple high-risk operations: network flooding (TCP/UDP/ICMP/Slowloris), ARP poisoning (including a variant with hardcoded MAC addresses), and packet sniffing. These features present significant potential for misuse and disruption if executed, especially with elevated privileges. There is no evidence of obfuscated backdoor or remote exfiltration C2 behavior in the provided fragment, but the active attack primitives make this unsuitable as a benign dependency. Treat as dangerous: do not install or run in production or untrusted environments; allow only under explicit authorization for security testing. babytalk 0.1.1 Removed from PyPI Blocked by Socket The function permits arbitrary code execution via eval() and exec() on substrings of the input 'command' with no validation or sandboxing. This is a high-risk vulnerability (remote code execution/data exfiltration/host compromise) if commands can be influenced by untrusted users. The provided snippet also contains a syntax error in the else return which prevents running as-is. The code looks like an unsafe, naive interpreter rather than an intentionally hidden backdoor, but it should not be used in production or with untrusted input without major redesign. Live on PyPI for 9 hours and 13 minutes before removal. Socket users were protected even while the package was live. mrg-polyfills 40.747.653 Removed from npm Blocked by Socket Possible 1-step D-L dist typosquat of mdn-polyfills - Explanation: The package 'mrg-polyfills' has a similar name to 'mdn-polyfills' with only minor character changes, which is typical of typosquatting. Additionally, the description 'security holding package' suggests it might be a placeholder to prevent typosquatting, but without more context, it appears suspicious. The maintainer 'npm' does not provide enough information to confirm legitimacy.


mrg-polyfills is a security-holding package. Closed as malicious Live on npm for 4 hours and 48 minutes before removal. Socket users were protected even while the package was live. meutils 2025.3.5.20.18.59 Live on PyPI Blocked by Socket The source code contains suspicious and potentially malicious behavior by uploading arbitrary local files and detailed metadata to a remote server using hardcoded authentication tokens and device identifiers. This constitutes a significant security risk involving unauthorized data exfiltration and privacy violation. Although no direct malware payload like reverse shells or destructive actions are present, the code should be considered high risk and likely malicious due to its data exfiltration capabilities and lack of user transparency. meshcentral 0.2.8-b by ysainthilaire Live on npm Blocked by Socket The code fragment exhibits high-risk patterns: a broad AMT tooling surface combined with a WebSocket relay proxy that can forward to arbitrary destinations, plus a large opaque payload and insecure TLS handling.

Nat Friedman CEO at GitHub Congrats to @ feross and the hard-working team behind @ SocketSecurity on today's launch! Suz Hinton Senior Software Engineer at Stripe heck yes this is awesome!!! Congrats team 🎉👏 Matteo Collina Node.js maintainer, Fastify lead maintainer So awesome to see @ SocketSecurity launch with a fresh approach! Excited to have supported the team from the early days. DC Posch Director of Technology at AppFolio, CTO at Dynasty This is going to be super important, especially for crypto projects where a compromised dependency results in stolen user assets. Luis Naranjo Software Engineer at Microsoft If software supply chain attacks through npm don't scare the shit out of you, you're not paying close enough attention. @ SocketSecurity sounds like an awesome product. I'll be using socket.dev instead of npmjs.org to browse npm packages going forward Elena Nadolinski Founder and CEO at Iron Fish Huge congrats to @ SocketSecurity ! 🙌 Literally the only product that proactively detects signs of JS compromised packages. Joe Previte Engineering Team Lead at Coder Congrats to @ feross and the @ SocketSecurity team on their seed funding! 🚀 It's been a big help for us at @ CoderHQ and we appreciate what y'all are doing! Josh Goldberg Staff Developer at Codecademy This is such a great idea & looks fantastic, congrats & good luck @ feross + team! Even more developer love → Install GitHub App Read the docs Security teams trust Socket The best security teams in the world use Socket to get visibility into supply chain risk, and to build a security feedback loop into the development process. Scott Roberts CISO at UiPath As a happy Socket customer, I've been impressed with how quickly they are adding value to the product, this move is a great step! Yan Zhu Head of Security at Brave, DEFCON, EFF, W3C glad to hear some of the smartest people i know are working on (npm, etc.) supply chain security finally :). @ SocketSecurity Andrew Peterson CEO and Co-Founder at Signal Sciences (acq. Fastly) How do you track the validity of open source software libraries as they get updated? You're prob not. Check out @ SocketSecurity and the updated tooling they launched. Supply chain is a cluster in security as we all know and the tools from Socket are "duh" type tools to be implementing. Check them out and follow Feross Aboukhadijeh to see more updates coming from them in the future. Zbyszek Tenerowicz Senior Security Engineer at ConsenSys socket.dev is getting more appealing by the hour Devdatta Akhawe Head of Security at Figma The @ SocketSecurity team is on fire! Amazing progress and I am exciting to see where they go next. Sebastian Bensusan Engineer Manager at Stripe I find it surprising that we don't have _more_ supply chain attacks in software: Imagine your airplane (the code running) was assembled (deployed) daily, with parts (dependencies) from internet strangers. How long until you get a bad part? Excited for Socket to prevent this Adam Baldwin VP of Security at npm, Red Team at Auth0/Okta Congrats to everyone at @ SocketSecurity ❤️🤘🏻 Nico Waisman CISO at Lyft This is an area that I have personally been very focused on. As Nat Friedman said in the 2019 GitHub Universe keynote, Open Source won, and every time you add a new open source project you rely on someone else code and you rely on the people that build it. This is both exciting and problematic. You are bringing real risk into your organization, and I'm excited to see progress in the industry from OpenSSF scorecards and package analyzers to the company that Feross Aboukhadijeh is building!

Nov 05, 2025 Elves on npm A surge of auto-generated "elf-stats" npm packages is being published every two minutes from new accounts. These packages contain simple malware variants and are being rapidly removed by npm. At least 420 unique packages have been identified, often described as being generated every two minutes, with some mentioning a capture the flag challenge or test. Jul 04, 2025 RubyGems Automation-Tool Infostealer Since at least March 2023, a threat actor using multiple aliases uploaded 60 malicious gems to RubyGems that masquerade as automation tools (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Telegram, WordPress, and Naver). The gems display a Korean Glimmer-DSL-LibUI login window, then exfiltrate the entered username/password and the host's MAC address via HTTP POST to threat actor-controlled infrastructure. Mar 13, 2025 North Korea's Contagious Interview Campaign Since late 2024, we have tracked hundreds of malicious npm packages and supporting infrastructure tied to North Korea's Contagious Interview operation, with tens of thousands of downloads targeting developers and tech job seekers. The threat actors run a factory-style playbook: recruiter lures and fake coding tests, polished GitHub templates, and typosquatted or deceptive dependencies that install or import into real projects. Jul 23, 2024 Network Reconnaissance Campaign A malicious npm supply chain attack that leveraged 60 packages across three disposable npm accounts to fingerprint developer workstations and CI/CD servers during installation. Each package embedded a compact postinstall script that collected hostnames, internal and external IP addresses, DNS resolvers, usernames, home and working directories, and package metadata, then exfiltrated this data as a JSON blob to a hardcoded Discord webhook.
