ImgBurn is a lightweight CD / DVD / HD DVD / Blu-ray burning application that everyone should have in their toolkit! It has several 'Modes', each one for performing a different task: Read - Read a disc to an image file Build - Create an image file from files on your computer or network - or you can write the files directly to a disc Write - Write an image file to a disc Verify - Check a disc is 100% readable. Optionally, you can also have ImgBurn compare it against a given image file to ensure the actual data is correct Discovery - Put your drive / media to the test! Used in combination with DVDInfoPro , you can check the quality of the burns your drive is producing advertisement ImgBurn supports a wide range of image file formats - including BIN, CCD, CDI, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, ISO, MDS, NRG and PDI. It can burn Audio CD's from any file type supported via DirectShow / ACM - including AAC, APE, FLAC, M4A, MP3, MP4, MPC, OGG, PCM, WAV, WMA and WV. You can use it to build DVD Video discs (from a VIDEO_TS folder), HD DVD Video discs (from a HVDVD_TS folder) and Blu-ray Video discs (from a BDAV / BDMV folder) with ease. It supports Unicode folder/file names, so you shouldn't run in to any problems if you're using an international character set. ImgBurn supports all the Microsoft Windows OS's - Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 (including all the 64-bit versions). If you use Wine , it should also run on Linux and other x86-based Unixes. It's a very flexible application with several advanced features that are often lacking in other tools, especially when it comes to burning DVD Video discs. It supports all the latest drives without the need for updates (including booktype / bitsetting / advanced settings on many of the major ones - i.e. BenQ, LiteOn, LG, NEC, Optiarc, Pioneer, Plextor, Samsung, Sony). There is an image queue system for when you're burning several images (which you can automatically share between multiple drives if you have more than one) and an easy-to-use layer break selection screen for double layer DVD Video jobs. The Automatic Write Speed feature allows you store your favourite burn speed settings on a per 'Media ID' basis, right down to a drive by drive level. Data captured during the burn (write speed, buffer levels etc) can be displayed / analysed using DVDInfoPro . Whilst ImgBurn is designed to work perfectly straight out of the box, advanced users will appreciate just how configurable it is. Oh and let's not forget the best thing about it.... it's 100% FREE ;-) Please do not use this software to make illegal copies of copyrighted discs. advertisement » News ImgBurn v2.5.8.0 Released!

Sunday 12th December 2010 Just a 'quick fix' release for the bug when adding multiple files via the 'Open File' dialog box (only applies to Vista+ because it's specific to the new IFileDialog code) - the first file in the selection was being removed from the list. I apologise for not noticing this issue before I released v2.5.3.0 last week, it was last minute code and I'm only human ;-) What's New: Click here to find out! Click here to download!

Wednesday 13th October 2010 I have quite a large collection of optical drives now (way beyond the capacity of my PC) and I've always wished I could have a few more on-hand for testing with. That's where my recent discovery of the 'Addonics Storage Tower' comes in! Addonics have Storage Tower units supporting 5 or 9 drives and up to 5 drives can be controlled via a single eSATA cable from your PC (9 therefore requires 2 cables). If any of the above sounds interesting to you, please take a look at the review I've just published. Review of Addonics Storage Tower V with 5x1 HPM-XA (ST55HPMXA) ImgBurn v2.5.2.0 Released!

Friday 10th April 2009 Originally intended to be a 'next day' release to fix the bug in v2.4.3.0 whereby the 'Supported Write Speeds' text was missing from the disc information box, I decided to wait few more days and add/tweak some other bits based on your feedback (and my own!) What's New: Click here to find out! Click here to download! ImgBurn v2.4.3.0 Released! Wednesday 1st April 2009 Once again, something serious on April Fools day! As it happens, the v2.4 series did need another 'maintenance' release and this is it... sorry! What's New: Click here to find out! Click here to download! FirmwareHQ.com Goes Live! Wednesday 1st April 2009 Firmware HQ https://www.firmwarehq.com/ As the name suggests, the site is dedicated to providing you with a one-stop-shop for the latest firmware releases for your optical disc drives. The site is a joint venture between the man behind 'Digital Digest' and us lot (and by that I mean myself and the beta team!). The site has actually been up and running for a few weeks now, but with the release of v2.4.3.0, I figured now was a good time to plug it! ImgBurn now uses the search engine on FirmwareHQ.com rather than the (until recently) defunct one on RPC1.org when you use the 'Tools' -> 'Drive' -> 'Check For Firmware Updates...' feature. ImgBurn v2.4.2.0 Released! Tuesday 22nd July 2008 This will probably be the last 'maintenance' type release for the v2.4 series, meaning I can finally start to implement some decent new features! Thanks again to everyone that have helped make this release possible. What's New: Click here to find out! Click here to download! ImgBurn v2.4.1.0 Released! Tuesday 1st April 2008 Finally... something serious on April Fools day! I'd like to take this opportunity to thank a few of the unsung heroes out there... 1. The Beta Team - They find the bugs so you don't have to! Occassionally they also come up with some decent ideas and if I'm feeling in a good mood I implement them! 2. The Translators - Helping to bring ImgBurn to the masses! I've enough trouble just doing the 'English (United Kingdom)' version so it's great that others take the time to translate it into their own language. 3. The Donors - All the kind people out there that donate some of their hard earnt cash. Seriously, without you lot ImgBurn wouldn't exist. What's New: Click here to find out! Click here to download! ImgBurn v2.4.0.0 Released! Sunday 10th February 2008 Wow, how time flies when you're having fun! It's been ages since the last release and of course there's nobody to blame for that except me. Still, good things come to those that wait - right?! In this release you'll find some new features such as BIN/CUE support (yes, that includes multi-session/track images, CD Audio etc) along with support for newer revisions of UDF (1.50, 2.00, 2.01, 2.50 and 2.60).
