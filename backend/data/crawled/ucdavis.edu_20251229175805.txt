College Town

Davis is the ultimate college town. It’s green, laid back and friendly. You can walk or bike from the main campus to the main street in a few blocks. College students fill up the tables at nearby restaurants and coffee shops with their laptops, homework and friends. The town of Davis helps our students thrive.
