The book creation engine I launched one month ago (books.BrightLearn.ai) now has over 3,600 authors who have published over 10,000 books. All the books are free to read and download, and we've served 109,000+ downloads so far! That makes Bright learn the #1 most popular book creation engine on the internet.

The books cover every topic imaginable, and are expertly researched through our curated document index, resulting in truly amazing books on topics from health and nutrition to finance, spirituality and survival.

We just completed a major database migration to an enterprise-grade db to handle the growth. Now, we'll be rolling out library downloads that allow users to download large selections of books to their local systems (Windows, Mac and Linux) so they can have reliable, decentralized, LOCAL knowledge, completely free, just in case the internet goes bonkers or the power grid goes down (or extreme censorship takes down websites).

You can explore the 10,000+ books right now and download the ones you like. You can also create your own books and use them for almost any purpose, including commercially.

Books are already being auto-converted into audio podcasts, and soon, we'll be auto-translating books into Spanish and then French.

This is the new age of knowledge abundance! Take advantage of it at BrightLearn.ai to create your own books on any topic, in mere minutes, completely free.
And thank you for your support that makes all this possible.

Alpha-carotene is stepping into the nutrition spotlight. This powerful plant pigment converts to vitamin A, supports vision and immunity, and acts as a potent antioxidant. Studies link higher levels to longevity and lower disease risk. Get it naturally from carrots, squash, pumpkin, and leafy greens with light cooking added.
