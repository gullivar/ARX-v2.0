I was a Windows user back in the day (my conversion to Apple didn’t happen until the early 00s) and so of course I had to see what other Win3.x games they had in their collection and re-discovered a couple of old favorites: The Incredible Machine . I loved this game…it was an early physics puzzler where you had to build contraptions to accomplish certain goals (like getting a ball into a hoop) with a limited selection of materials. (I just played for 20 minutes and I still love it.) Tripeaks . I’d forgotten about this solitaire variant. Freecell . This isn’t the official Microsoft version, but it’s close enough. I played Freecell much more than solitaire or Tripeaks. Pipe Dream . I actually had this one on Nintendo, I think. Or maybe my neighbor did? Another fun little puzzler. Minesweeper . Everyone’s played this at some point. Tetris . Ditto. Although I played mostly on my Game Boy. Klotski . Ok this one was the biggest nostalgia bomb of all. The name sounded familiar so I clicked on it and wow, I played so much of this one and had completely forgotten all about it until I played the demo. Wow wow wow. Doom . Of course. Ok, that’s enough, I need to get back to work! video games Windows Reply · 0 Share Open post Copy link Translate Bluesky Mastodon Reddit Threads Email Text/SMS WhatsApp Active Threads Your Threads Rian Johnson Breaks Down a Scene From Wake Up Dead Man 1 comment      Latest: 2025-12-30T22:14:01Z ProPublica launches Rx Inspector database.

This is not that far from the position many ordinary Americans found themselves in at the start of the Trump era. They weren’t time travelers but saw what was coming clearly enough. They called Trump’s movement fascist from the very start, and often predicted specific milestones of our democratic decline well in advance. They were convinced they were right — and often beside themselves with worry. Accordingly, they did everything they could to get others to listen. But not enough people did, and many attacked them — even as events proved them right, again and again. As late as February 2025, respected legal commentator Noah Feldman was casually asserting our constitutional system was “working fine” and Jon Stewart was scolding people who used the word “fascist,” claiming all they had done “over the last ten years is cry wolf.” I’m glad Buckle wrote about this…it’s infuriating . Who were the folks attempting to sound the alarm? The first thing to say about fascism’s Cassandras is they’re usually women. Not all women are Cassandras (most aren’t), but most Cassandras are women. My sense is that Black Americans, of either gender, are likelier than whites to be Cassandras, and trans and nonbinary people are heavily overrepresented within the group. I was posting about Trump’s authoritarianism in the months before the 2016 election 1 because I felt it was pretty easy to spot but mostly because I was listening to the sorts of people that Buckle interviews in his piece: predominately Black, many women, many LGBTQ+ folks. And what were they saying? Jamelle Bouie, then a columnist at Slate, stated it plainly in Nov 2015: Donald Trump Is a Fascist . Buckle again: What were they afraid of? Authoritarianism, political violence, racism, sexism, corruption, as well as threats to bodily autonomy and LGBT rights, were the common themes. Everyone mentioned at least one of those, and the vast majority mentioned multiple. “All the implications that I knew the election would have that have all come true, essentially,” as Emily, a 38-year-old white female writer in Chicago, put it. Cassandras are defined by seeing in MAGA not just policies they disagreed with but a loaded gun pointed at the heart of our politics and culture. “It just felt to me like we were the Weimar Republic; the lying press, the way he was weaponizing American people … the othering of people — Hispanics, they’re rapists, and all of that,” said Sonia, a 52-year-old white woman who works in marketing in Los Angeles. The anti-alarmists — Buckle lists several of them: Ezra Klein, Matt Yglesias, Bret Stephens, Corey Robin, Jon Stewart, David Brooks, William Watson, John Harris, Simon Jenkins, Zachary Karabell, Josh Barro, and Noah Feldman — scolded and derided the Cassandras. Going forward, we should be skeptical of giving them and others like them our attention when they pooh pooh people fighting against obvious racism, fascism, and kleptocracy; dismiss these dangers as mere partisan differences, culture wars, wokeism, or rhetoric; and argue for what amounts to meeting the nazis halfway . Here’s a post from July 2016 explicitly comparing him to Hitler , which I’m sure I got scolding emails about. And I know I’ve lost quite a few readers over the years because of my “obsession” with Trump. ↩ 2025 Coup Donald Trump fascism Jamelle Bouie politics Toby Buckle Share Open post Copy link Translate Bluesky Mastodon Reddit Threads Email Text/SMS WhatsApp kdo rolodex · a list of kindred spirits, friends, open web enthusiasts, role models, fellow travelers, and collaborators Dense Discovery https://densediscovery.com Leslie Harpold (RIP) https://web.archive.org/web/20010216194511/http://www.hoopla.com/nav.html Letters of Note https://lettersofnote.com Every Frame a Painting https://youtube.com/@everyframeapainting Gastropod https://gastropod.com refresh for more posted Dec 30 @ 01:58 PM by Jason Kottke · gift link · via waxy.org Oh this is devilish… a game where you have make to 45 groups of 45 items each by matching two at a time .

So I enjoyed director Rian Johnson breaking down the investigative scene in the bar in this Vanity Fair video . This is, for me, even a little more personal than the previous movies because faith and religion is at the heart of this movie. And I grew up very Christian. I grew up not Catholic. This movie is set in a Catholic church. I grew up Protestant, kind of what we would call evangelical today. I was a youth group kid and it wasn’t just that my parents took me to church. I really, my whole perspective in life was really based on a relationship with Christ. It was very important to me. I’m not anymore, I’ve kind of grown away from that later in life, but it’s still something that I have deep feelings about. So this movie, in a way, by having Father Jud and Benoit Blanc kind of talk about this and kind of butt heads about it, it was a way for me to take both of those perspectives inside me and get them talking with each other. The practical effect with the photograph (~10:05 mark) was 💯. I can’t for the life of me ever remember the name of this movie and end up searching for it (“dicaprio pta movie”) every time I want to write or talk about it. ↩ film school movies Rian Johnson video Wake Up Dead Man Reply · 1 Share Open post Copy link Translate Bluesky Mastodon Reddit Threads Email Text/SMS WhatsApp posted Dec 30 @ 12:05 PM by Jason Kottke · gift link ProPublica launches Rx Inspector database . “We’ve launched a first-of-its-kind app to help you find out where your generic drugs come from and see the track records of the factories that made them.” Introducing Rx Inspector, ProPublica’s Prescription Drug Lookup Tool — ProPublica · propublica.org We’ve launched a first-of-its-kind app to help you find out where your generic drugs come from and see the track records of the factories that made them.

Members can now click on any song in their collection to play it (previously there was only a randomize button). I added this because I often wanted to listen to a particular song/album/playlist, genre, or tempo (chill, upbeat, etc.) 1 and sat there hitting the random button until I got something I liked. No more; quick selection and back into the work groove. If you missed it, here’s what I wrote about Underscore at launch: Here’s how it works. You can add links to music from Spotify, YouTube, Soundcloud, Bandcamp, and Apple Music to it — just paste their share URLs in. Reloading the page gives you a random piece of music from your collection. You can see a list of the songs, videos, playlists, and albums in your collection and can hide them if you want. That’s it. That’s all it does. There’s no APIs or authentication or auto-synching playlists. The music is played through embedded players and if it lands on something from Spotify, Apple Music, or Bandcamp, you’re gonna have to click the play button in the embedded player (Soundcloud and YT videos should play automatically (but don’t always for whatever reason)). When your current selection ends, the new random thing doesn’t automatically play…you need to refresh the page. I use Underscore every single day while I’m working. Is anyone else out there using it? P.S. I also added the ability to add Tidal albums & playlists to Underscore. Unfortunately, Tidal’s embedded player doesn’t play full-length songs, even for logged-in users. If you’re a Tidal user, bug them about adding this feature to their embedded player! I prefer chill in the morning and when writing. When designing or programming, I like something more upbeat. Also depends on my mood on the day. ↩ kottke.org music Underscore Reply · 1 Share Open post Copy link Translate Bluesky Mastodon Reddit Threads Email Text/SMS WhatsApp posted Dec 29 @ 11:21 AM by Jason Kottke · gift link Thin Desires Are Eating Your Life . “A thick desire is one that changes you in the process of pursuing it.

These newly discovered pieces all contribute to give the fullest picture of the man behind the books. Here’s a sample from his teenage diary he kept on a trip to France: And from a review in the Guardian : Some of the loveliest passages come when Bourdain writes with just-so tenderness and precision about his family: a journey with his brother to La Teste-de-Buch in France among whose sand dunes they holidayed as young men; the outsize pleasure he takes in his five-year-old daughter nibbling on Pecorino and an anchovy. I suspect Bourdain will be read in years to come less as a writer about food than of food work.

Since we had a robust discussion last month on whether Pluribus sucks or not, I thought I’d ask: now that the season finale has aired, what did you think of the first season as a whole? My impression of the show has improved slightly, but this feeling remains: It was somewhere around the middle of episode two when I started asking myself if I was supposed to care about Carol and what was going to happen to her, which is never a good sign. I like plenty of shows with unlikable protagonists (like Succession & Seinfeld) but I often can’t get past stubborn & incurious ones — it just seems fake to me and breaks my willing suspension of disbelief. I’m definitely in the minority here, but I just don’t think Carol’s character is very realistic — like, I’m not sure how that post-joining person with that personality got to where she was in the world pre-joining. That said, I find the premise of the show and the intellectual tension of the individual vs. the hive mind very interesting; I’ll give season two a shot.

Just in case (like the me of 1 minute ago) you don’t know what that is (although you will recognize it from just a few seconds of listening to the video), voila: A madrigal is a form of secular vocal music most typical of the Renaissance (15th–16th centuries) and early Baroque (1580–1650) periods, although revisited by some later European composers. The polyphonic madrigal is unaccompanied, and the number of voices varies from two to eight, but the form usually features three to six voices, whilst the metre of the madrigal varies between two or three tercets, followed by one or two couplets. Wolf has a few more videos of “pop songs in renaissance and baroque style” on his YouTube channel . (Note: these are not AI in case you were wondering/worried.)

Since he was floating in the water, you get to see the whales underwater before they jump, breaching, and then diving down underwater again. Given how cool this looks on video, it must have been amazing to witness in person.
