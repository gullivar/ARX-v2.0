Why 10,000+ tax, accounting, and bookkeeping firms trust TaxDome

Andrew Payne, Senior Compliance Specialist, Foundation Group, 50+ staff serving 3,000+ clients

“TaxDome has greatly enhanced our daily operations as a company. We’ve been able to reduce a lot of manual, tedious input that we had to do [with] prior systems.”

John Siebert, CPA and owner of Siebert & Associates, 1,000+ clients, 10 team members

“The buy-in from the client base, the response from the clients have been overwhelmingly positive. We aren’t working 80-hour weeks anymore. Tax season is now manageable.”
MF

Michael Flax, CPA, MBA, Founder & President, Flax CPA & Business Solutions

“TaxDome’s Bookkeeping Hub has been a game changer for our firm and our clients. It’s saved us over $10,000 a year by replacing another software we used for the same purpose. For our clients, everything now happens inside TaxDome instead of jumping to another tool to answer questions about transactions.”

Lisa Sheldon, founder of Blueridge Tax Accounting, 100+ clients, 5 team members

“You’re making things so easy for me and my team… it’s hard to justify an extra team member, even though I’m growing rapidly. It’s not replacing labor; it’s just letting accountants do accounting work — the software does the things that we don’t want to do.”
