Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? William Herrin via NANOG (Dec 30) Actually, they only have to agree on the MRU and the upper level protocols just about always provide mechanisms to assure the packets they emit won't exceed the recipient's MRU. It's not -quite- that simple but it's simple enough that but for PMTUD being broken on the Internet we could have moved to 9k MTUs by now. Interestingly, AWS VPCs mostly have moved to 9k MTUs. Check your EC2 instance: $ ifconfig -a ens5:... Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? nanog--- via NANOG (Dec 30) I thought 9000-byte MTU wasn't used on LANs due to the headache of ensuring every single device on the LAN has the same MTU. You don't need PMTUD to work on the internet to use longer packets in your LAN. The "packet too big" reply only has to make it from *your* edge router back to *your* server through *your* network. But every host and switch in an Ethernet must agree on MTU because there's no Ethernet-layer PMTUD. Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? William Herrin via NANOG (Dec 27) Correct: PMTUD on the Internet is broken. ISPs work around this by engineering a clean 1500 byte path everywhere they can and clamping the MSS the few places that they can't. There's a reason we haven't moved up to 9kb ethernet frames on the server and eyeball LANs. This is that reason. Everybody emits them. Too many don't make it to the destination. Regards, Bill Herrin Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator?

Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? Ca By via NANOG (Dec 27) Quic, being modern, has many of these ideas built-in. For example, it has a spin bit and active pmtu discovery along with general lower mss built in. Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? Pedro Prado via NANOG (Dec 27) Yup, sure it’s UDP; I was just curious wether those providers were also trying to find a way to affect QUIC… Sent from my iPhone Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? Marco Moock via NANOG (Dec 26) It uses UDP, so it is affected by NAT, but not by MSS-clamping. If PMTUD fails and people use MSS-Clamping, QUIC will fail. Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? Pedro Prado via NANOG (Dec 26) Is QUIC also affected in any way? Sent from my iPhone Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? Tim Burke via NANOG (Dec 26) I think the general stance, at least in my opinion, is that it may be acceptable for a non-fixed broadband service (e.g., cell phone service), while it is not for a fixed broadband (FTTP or otherwise). I fully expect CGNAT, a basic level of packet mangling in an effort to maximize performance on the cell network, etc., while I am hopping between several different cell towers in an area along with thousands of other users, in an effort to...

Re: What do you consider acceptable packet / session modification for a network operator? Jared Mauch via NANOG (Dec 26) Some devices you can configure this, but it varies and gets even more interesting when you have a device that may not even have an IPv4 address but is processing IPv4 packets. Eg: https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cli-reference/topics/ref/statement/autogen-protocols-bgp-group-family-inet-unicast-extended-nexthop.html I think as the scope of IPv4 public continues to narrow we will see more of this as time goes on....

Indeed, but a filtering problem if routers on the path filter non-public address ranges.
