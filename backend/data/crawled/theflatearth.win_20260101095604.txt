Although widely disproven by scientific evidence and observation, the theory has persisted historically and experienced a resurgence in recent decades, particularly through social media. Historical Background The belief in a flat Earth dates back to ancient civilizations: Ancient Cultures Mesopotamia : Early cosmologies depicted Earth as a flat disk surrounded by ocean. Ancient Egypt : Believed the Earth was a flat plane floating on water. Ancient Greece : Philosophers such as Thales and Anaximander proposed flat-earth cosmologies, although later Greek thinkers like Pythagoras and Aristotle promoted a spherical Earth. Medieval Period Contrary to modern myth, most educated medieval Europeans accepted that Earth was spherical, influenced by ancient Greek and Islamic scholars. However, some early medieval scholars still illustrated Earth as flat in specific symbolic contexts. Modern Flat Earth Movement The modern Flat Earth movement began in the 19th century: Samuel Rowbotham and Zetetic Astronomy Samuel Rowbotham (1816–1884) introduced a modern form of Flat Earth Theory called Zetetic Astronomy , based on literal interpretations of biblical texts and selective scientific observations. He published a pamphlet, later expanded into the book Earth Not a Globe . Flat Earth Society In 1956, Samuel Shenton established the International Flat Earth Research Society , later shortened to the Flat Earth Society . This organization popularized Flat Earth ideas through newsletters, lectures, and later, online presence. Resurgence in the 21st Century Social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter played a significant role in the recent revival and global spread of Flat Earth beliefs. Figures such as Mark Sargent and Eric Dubay gained notoriety through internet videos promoting the Flat Earth concept. Core Beliefs Flat Earth proponents typically assert: Earth is a flat disk with the North Pole at the center and Antarctica forming an ice wall around the edge. The Sun and Moon are much smaller and closer than mainstream science describes, moving above the Earth in circular paths. Gravity is often denied or replaced by alternative explanations, such as buoyancy and density. Space exploration, satellite imagery, and photographs of Earth from space are dismissed as conspiracies. Criticism and Scientific Refutation The Flat Earth Theory has been thoroughly refuted through multiple lines of scientific evidence: Astronomical Observations : Earth's curvature is observable through eclipses, star positions, and time zones. Geographical Measurements : Surveying and navigation methods consistently demonstrate Earth's curvature. Photographic Evidence : Thousands of images from space agencies worldwide clearly depict Earth as spherical. Physics : Gravitational theory accurately predicts planetary movements and phenomena, which are incompatible with a flat model. Sociocultural Impact The Flat Earth movement highlights broader issues in contemporary society, such as distrust in institutions, misinformation online, and scientific literacy challenges. The growth of the movement is often cited as evidence of deeper societal skepticism toward authority and expert knowledge. References Rowbotham, Samuel. Earth Not a Globe (1881). Garwood, Christine.
