MDDHosting - Professional Hosting Solutions US 1-877-412-4678 International 1-317-961-1116 PROFESSIONAL WEB HOSTING SOLUTIONS Blazing Fast StorPool Powered Cloud × Our Blazing Fast StorPool powered Cloud Platforms are Highly Available , Distributed and Self-Healing . Blazing Performance Our Plaid platform is powered by AMD Epyc Blazing Fast processors and NVMe storage. Multiple NVMe Drives in a shared pool of storage which is distributed between multiple servers. Data is read and written from and to many drives in parallel, aggregating not only the capacity, but the performance of all drives in the system. This allows us to achieve a phenomenal latency and data transfer rates.  Read and write latency as low as 30 microseconds (0.03 milliseconds) and transfer rates of up to several gigabytes per second. Our Turbo and Elastic platforms are faster and more consistent than our competition running on Intel XEON processors with SSD storage.  While we do recommend our Plaid plans for those that want maximum speed, our Turbo and Elastic plans are still very high performance and are more budget-friendly. The SSD storage can achieve read and write latency as low as 300 microseconds (0.3 milliseconds) as well as data transfer rates of up to several gigabytes per second. Fully Redundant Multiple copies of your data are stored synchronously across multiple storage drives and servers with no single points of failure.
