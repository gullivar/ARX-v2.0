But most CRMs have a dirty little secret… They don’t get used. Choosing your CRM is the easy first step. But… It's hard getting your team to use it. It's hard getting data into it. It's hard fitting it into your workflow. Why? Because most CRMs don’t actually help those doing the work. They take your team out of flow and make them uselessly “log” data. Streak is different . Streak lives in your inbox. The place where you do all your work. It’s always there, so your team actually uses it. Integrated directly into Gmail Automated team-wide email logging Pipeline and deal tags in your inbox “My inbox is where I live, where I communicate with my friends, family and clients. Why would I leave that place and log into something completely different and alien to me?” Quentin Dane Owner at Coldwell Banker HPW Streak is smart. It uses every interaction in your team's inbox to fill itself out, answer deal questions, and summarize next steps. AI data entry keeps deals up to date Ask questions in natural language Prioritize with magic columns And yes, it does all the standard CRM things you expect… and does them really well. Task management Contact management Deal comments Mail merge Direct integrations Funnel reports Pipeline permissions Make calls from Streak Data validation See the full feature lineup With Streak, you won’t be flying blind. You’ll finally know how every deal is doing. Your team will know what to do next . And you won’t pull your hair out getting them to use it. People love Streak because... It grows with your business Teams stick with it Everything is in one place Help is fast and reliable It’s highly customizable 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I credit Streak with growing my wholesale business 100%. I was chipping away at trying to get my products into new shops and Streak opened up an automation window that I didn't know existed! It has been easy to implement and grow my business with! Rebecca Woolbright Jan 9, 2025 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I have been a Streak user for many years, both own the free plan as well as paid plans. It just gets better all the time. Customer support is outstanding. Previous I tried several CRM systems. Streak is AAA+ Manie Esterhuizen Jul 25, 2023 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Using Streak since 1,5 years and I'm super happy for having elevated my efficiency and CRM with this amazing tool. I could create several pipelines, delegate to colleagues, sharing with colleagues, creating follow-up and reminder workflows. Also customization of pipelines are easy to make. E-Mail performance and outreach planning at its best - very smart & not overloaded. Nicolas Ting Jan 29, 2025 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Been using Streak for almost 10 years across 3 companies! It's a great CRM for my sales team, but also myself as a tool to help me with fundraising and keeping track of partners. Can't beat how integrated it is into my Gmail workflow! Chris Buttenham Oct 4, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Streak is awesome and the best in class for email integrated CRM, particularly small businesses that work on gmail. It has a clean excel like interface & they developed an App... It is a no brainer, goto CRM, compared to all other CRMs out there. We evaluated many CRMs 10 years back, when we first started with Streak. Kamlesh R. Mar 18, 2021 IT Consultant 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I have used streak for over 5 years, it’s embedded in my teams day to day, it’s so flexible and we can create awesome interactions with other apps using zapier. When I show recruits and clients how we're organised (they are fund managers) they can only wish to have something as integrated and fast, often they are left with multiple software packages that dont talk to each other. Highly recommended. Ben Burling Nov 4, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I have been using streak for over 10 years with multiple businesses. They are supportive and responsive when I had minor issues. Overall, Streak CRM is robust and actively growing a great product for Gmail users. Especially ones who use iPhone. Lyle Phipps Feb 13, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I've been using Streak since 2014, and I've rolled it out in almost every organization I've been involved with. It only got better through the years. I ended up using it even for managing my wedding invites! 😆 Gal Lin 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Completely upgraded my operations and focus on things that bring in money. The spreadsheet is out and STREAK IS IN! ;P Ellen Stone Dec 1, 2023 Feel more love 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I have been using Streak since 2018, and I am absolutely satisfied with it. The CRM has all the necessary features, and the best part is that I don't have to leave my Gmail account to use it. As a manager, Streak has been invaluable for me to track leads and prevent anything from slipping through the cracks. The new AI launch has been a game-changer, especially the autofill feature. My team doesn't have to worry about filling out all the boxes manually anymore, making everything so much easier. Frankie Gonzalez Product Hunt 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I actually love Streak. It is so easy to use and it makes working actually fun. So easy to keep everything well organized and so easy to look back to find it all. I highly recommend. Tammy Mahaffey Nov 4, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I use Streak for almost a year now. It's a nice, easy to use CRM with plenty features, lots of automation included. What I like most about it is the fact that is so easy to define new customer/contact and to fill in data for each of them. Data fields are always in reach and I don't have to switch through different windows/tabs to put my data in. I use it for a small/medium company and I it serves me well. Great job guys! Marius Gabreanu Jan 19, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 The way it seamlessly integrates with GMail is absolutely amazing. Running a small business I am spinning a lot of plates and having a CRM seamlessly integrated with my email client is a huge deal. It means I will actually use it consistently. It gives me everything I need out of a CRM and the ease of use is fantastic. The pricing is great as well. Verified User Jun 21, 2022 Small Business 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 The seamless integration with Gmail makes it incredibly convenient to manage our customer relationships directly from our inbox. Streak helps us stay organized and on track with its easy-to-use features like email tracking, reminders, and customizable pipelines. The ability to share emails, notes, and call logs within our team ensures that everyone is on the same page and can pick up where others left off.  Overall, Streak has significantly improved our workflow efficiency, and we highly recommend it for any business looking for a reliable CRM solution. Christa Cloud Jul 11, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Should be a default feature of Gmail. I use streak almost daily and it works perfectly with gmail. The ability to organise and track emails through the steps of a pipeline from within gmail. Setting up a pipeline takes little knowledge and using the system keeps my clients on track Verified User Feb 8, 2024 Small Business, Music Industry 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I've used Streak for the past 2 years or so. As an Account Manager in public relations, I needed a way to reliably and easily track who was actually checking out my sent messages, and who was most likely to respond well to my email campaigns. Ever since then, Streak has been completely adopted into my workflow, and I absolutely can't do without it! Madeline K. Dec 27, 2022 Account Manager 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I have tried many extensions to help with organizing my email/tasks and this is the first one that has really worked. It is simple to use and does exactly what I need. Love it! Selene Faire Jul 20, 2023 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Streak is truly a collaborative tool that enables our team to work together to manage workflows, sales leads, and information storage. Michelle L. Jun 22, 2022 Feel more love 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 We have grown our business using Streak. We were an early adopter some 8 or so years ago when it showed promise as a great Gmail add-on. I have experimented with a few CRMs over the years but nothing comes close to Streak for it's functionality and FULL integration into Gmail. I see what other people use and the biggest drawback for many other CRMs is the clunky integration. The fact that you can send and receive emails in Gmail that are then automatically detected and filed in Streak Boxes is the best thing since sliced bread. Once you've used it, there's no going back. I feel sorry for people who have to use other CRMs ;-) Paul Wilson Jan 21, 2025 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 @Streak is my preferred CRM tool, baked into Gmail makes it easy here. Adam Draper Dec 16, 2024 Founder of @BoostVC 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I've been a loyal user of Streak since 2015, and over the years, it has solidified its position as my only indispensable productivity tool. As someone who relies heavily on email for both personal and professional communication, Streak has transformed my Gmail experience into a powerhouse of organization and efficiency. While it's too early for me to provide a comprehensive review of Streak's new AI features, I'm incredibly excited about their potential. The prospect of AI-powered box insights, which promise to provide summaries of deal interactions and automatically fill in fields, is particularly intriguing. Max Khalkhali Sep 13, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Masterful integration with Google's core productivity products (Gmail, G-Cal, G-Contacts, G-Meet, etc.). I wanted a CRM that increased efficiencies AND reduced redundancies, eliminated multiple software subscriptions, and existed WITHIN gmail. Streak achieves all of this (and—believe me—so much more) with flying colours. Clayton B. Nov 15, 2022 Real Estate Broker 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Streak is the go to option if you're looking for a CRM inside Gmail. The convenience of not having to switch tabs or bcc your CRM is a life/time saver. Inbox labels, a sidebar for context and a bunch of email power features add great value: Open/link tracking, shared snipppets, team email sharing, mail merge, drip sequences... Support is also stellar with quick feedback and a growing knowledge base. What more can one want? :)We're a small team of happy Streak power users since 2016. Streak, keep the good work up. Ricardo Fahrig Feb 10, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I've been using Streak CRM for Gmail for a few months now, and it has completely transformed how I manage my workflow and communication. Integrating directly into Gmail is a game-changer – I can keep everything organized without switching between apps. Maciej Korostyński Jan 27, 2025 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Streak is slick. I love that I can use it right out of my inbox, and they have amazing support/resources. We use this with a small team (6 members) for managing contacts & donors for a political campaign and it has saved us on multiple occasions. Being able to share emails between team members is amazing, and Streak really facilitates and easy and transparent flow of information. Definitely recommend. Reba Patton Nov 4, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I tried a few different CRM programs, but they all felt cumbersome and difficult to get used to. I love that Streak works with a system I'm already comfortable with. I have found it to be super intuitive and easy to use, which is to say, I didn't have to spend a lot of time figuring out how to use it. April Davila Apr 21, 2023 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Simple to use, directly integrated into my Gmail. As a bootstrapped startup founder, Streak works perfectly for us. It has just the right features to keep us building and focusing on our customers. Félix Poirier Apr 12, 2024 Feel more love 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I love how easy it is to set up and how in depth the tutorials are. The customer support is top notch and they respond quickly whenever I have a question. Kay P. Feb 8, 2024 Small Business 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Love Streak CRM and best of the best support.

Daniele Jun 26, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 best customer support I've ever contacted and by extension they've an amazing product that actually provide you with what you need, not a bunch of non sense ai tools that you just get charged for for no reason and you end up spending money and not getting any kind of return Joe Specter Feb 20, 2024 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 Based on the support from the tech folks at Streak, I'm in for the long haul... and the features in the app are pretty cool too, but the tech support is stunning. Bill Young Aug 22, 2024 Feel more love 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 STREAK has become an essential 'can't work without' tool. It allows me to see the big picture, without losing sight of the details, and vice versa. I use it both as a CRM and as a work-management system. It is hands-down the single most useful tool I've discovered for getting things done! Thomas Cairns Jan 8, 2025 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 It was easy to set up and integrate, and is easy to add bulk info to which I appreciate since I use Streak every single day. Love how customizable it is and that I can create different pipelines for different products I offer. Kay P. Feb 8, 2024 Small Business 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I'm a big fan of Streak. I use it as a project management system more than a traditional CRM. Not hyperbole to say it's been a game-changer. Thank you, Streak Team!

Jun 21, 2022 National Sales Manager 😠 🙁 😐 😃 🤩 I have used streak in multiple ways as a sales CRM to manage clients and make notes about them.
