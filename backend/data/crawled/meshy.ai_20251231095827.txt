Showcase Explore More User Stories Incredible text to 3D and more! No limits to your imagination. If you have a creative mind, you can indulge yourself in creating everything that comes to mind, in a 3D version. The latest update has brought further improvements, furthermore in just 60 seconds 8 results of what we are going to create are generated. Of these, we can request an upscale or rather a refinement of the result. There are 3 3D generation possibilities which are as follows: from text, from image and the fantastic retexture function. I am one of the lucky winners of the retexture contest which gave away color stickers printed with a 3D printer! It is possible to export your creation in video format and in the glb format exportable to 3D editing software. Rating: 5 stars deserved!! Max Casu AI Creator The level of texture and ease of the UI are incredible and unmatched. I use way too many 3D tools and this sits at the top of my workflow. Thanks Meshy! Tom Blake Digital Artist My current go-to for AI 3D model generation tool. The latest Meshy 4 generations have been a huge leap in terms of quality for both text and image to 3D. Plus I've already got lots of value out of the easy biped/quadruped rigging and walking animation option. Also, it's great to see the texturing improvements and the ability to retexture or fix textured sections (via the text-to-3d approach). Jon Draper AI Animator & Developer Who would have said that at some point we could use #AI to #texture our #3D models? @MeshyAI can really texture anything. From models you import to anything you create in other tools (without any UV mapping needed 🤯). Gabriele Romagnoli 3D Artist With @MeshyAI you can generate your textures in ai, but what makes this a winner is it's amazing easy-to-use Interface, and the GLB maps you can use with #b3d #blender - #3D #artists, check this tool to texture your #models! (not sponsored). Pierre Schiller 3D Artist It's really blowing my mind how far we've come with text-to-3D. It was only a few months ago we were getting very unimpressive results from tools like Shap-E. Now I can make full on objects that are borderline game ready. Matt Wolfe AI Creator 2025 is the year 3D AI takes over! Meshy AI lets you turn a single image into high-quality 3D model. Then, you can choose any angle and bring it to life with an AI video generator. 3D AI is the future of content creation. el.cine AI Creator I absolutely love this deep-sea steel city that blends surrealism and steampunk styles. It’s incredibly exciting to see a world from my imagination gradually take shape in the game! @MeshyAI DarkTree Game Studio Game Developer Meshy.ai is getting so much better. Last time I tried it, I was happy to get a blob in roughly the right shape. Now it seems capable of producing some really intricate forms while adhering to the prompt quite well.
