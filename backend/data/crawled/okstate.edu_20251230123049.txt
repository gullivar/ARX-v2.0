The Code Calls
OSU launches historic campaign
A bold new chapter has begun for Oklahoma State University with the public unveiling of The Code Calls, a $2 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign. The Code Calls isn't just about our brand; it's a reflection of our Cowboy Code and who Cowboys are: people who dream as big as the sky, stand for what matters and finish what they start. Through this new era, OSU will offer life-changing opportunities to students, invest in cutting-edge research, and build a future rooted in character and impact.
