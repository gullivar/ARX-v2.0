Our Avigilon Access Control Guide can help you follow best practices and answer questions such as ​ “ How do I choose the best access control?” and ​ “ What is the most secure type of access control system?” Download free guide What access control credentials does Avigilon support? Avigilon’s access control supports a wide range of credentials, including mobile devices, key fobs and cards, PIN codes, guest passes and more. See credential options What is access control? Access control is a security measure which restricts access or entry to certain areas. Using key card readers, PIN codes, mobile credentials and other hardware, access control ensures that only authorized individuals with proper entry credentials are able to access specified areas. Download guide Why is access control important? Access control is an essential element of security because it can help protect property, people and sensitive data from external and internal threats by ensuring that only authorized individuals are able to enter certain areas. The importance of access control also lies in streamlining day-to-day building entry, making commercial office access and visitor management simpler and more secure. Download guide How does an access control system work? Access control systems work by authenticating, authorizing and granting access at specific entry points. An entry credential, such as a key card , mobile phone or fingerprint, is presented to a reader device, which authenticates that the credential is valid, authorizes that the credential is permitted for the specific location and then allows the door or barrier to open. Access control credentials, permissions and entry points can be configured with modern management software platforms, and reader devices are integrated with door hardware to trigger locking and unlocking. Download guide What is mobile access control? Mobile access control uses smartphones, smart watches and other mobile devices to authorize entry to secure areas. Credentials are loaded or sent to a user’s device, which can then be presented to reader devices. Mobile devices can be a secure method of credentialing, as multi-factor authentication, like fingerprint and facial recognition, are usually built into these devices to verify the user. Download guide How does touchless access control work? With a touchless access control system , users present their credentials near a door-mounted reader. Avigilon Alta Access features a unique Wave to Unlock capability that allows users to simply wave their hand in front of the reader while carrying their phone. The commercial keyless entry system verifies the credentials, and if authorized, grants access. Download guide How does access control integrate with existing technology? As a software-based system, access control can be integrated with video security cameras, intrusion detection alarms and motion sensors to strengthen an organization’s security posture and enhance situational awareness. This improves safety and security as operators can quickly detect and respond to incidents. Download guide What are the key components of an access control security system? The key components of an access control security system are: Readers : Attached to entry points to verify a user’s credentials Key cards or credentials: Issued to users to present at barrier points Management software: Allows for adding users, adjusting permissions and revoking credentials Hardware: Integrates with software and readers to allow entry points to physically open Download guide What industries benefit the most from access control systems? The benefits of an access control system can be seen across several industries, such as: Commercial offices Healthcare Education Government Logistics Retail Data centers Manufacturing Download guide How much does an access control system cost? The cost of an access control security system varies depending on several factors.

Get pricing Which access control solution is right for my organization?
