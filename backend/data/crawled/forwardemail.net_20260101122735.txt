Our service ensures your mailboxes are only accessible by you and are not stored in a shared database. We purposely designed our service so that it operates in-memory when you connect and we don't even have access to your mailbox at rest. If you forget your password, then you lose your mailbox and need to either recover with offline backups or start over. How do I get started? Simply go to My Account → Domains → Aliases, click Add Alias (or) Edit Alias, and then click the checkbox to enable IMAP Storage. You can even have both IMAP storage and forwarding recipients enabled at the same time. What email clients can I use? You can easily send and receive email with these popular email clients using our instructions (click here) . Apple® Windows® Android™ Linux® Desktop Chrome® Terminal How does it work? We use individual mailboxes encrypted with your password. Our service uses encryption-at-rest (AES-256), encryption-in-transit (TLS), and industry standard security procedures. We are also 100% open-source and privacy-focused. At anytime you can download, view, export, backup, and/or delete your mailboxes – and easily migrate to or from another email service provider . What are your storage limits? If you exceed the default storage limit of 10 GB, then you can purchase additional storage as needed. Additional storage costs $3 per month per each additional 10 GB. Storage is shared across all of your domains and aliases, but you can impose limits if desired on a per domain and alias basis. Unlike other email providers, you do not need to pay for storage on a per domain or alias basis.

Enhanced Protection ($3/month) is perfect for individuals who need professional email with sending/receiving capabilities, 10GB storage, and API access. Team plan ($9/month) adds collaborative features like team member management, shared organizational access, and priority support - ideal for families, groups, and businesses. Can I send and receive emails with the Free plan? No, the Free plan only supports email forwarding. You can receive emails at your custom domain and forward them to your existing email address, but you cannot send emails directly from your custom domain or store emails on our servers. Who should choose the Team plan? The Team plan is perfect for families sharing a domain (like @smithfamily.com), small businesses with multiple employees, organizations needing shared email management, or any group that requires collaborative access to email accounts with proper permission controls. What does 'unlimited domains' mean? All plans include unlimited domains at no extra cost. Whether you have 1 domain or 100 domains, you pay the same price. This makes our service extremely cost-effective for users managing multiple websites or businesses. Do you charge per user/alias like other services? No! Unlike other email services that charge per user or alias, we include unlimited aliases in our Enhanced Protection and Team plans. Create as many email addresses as you need (info@, sales@, support@, etc.) without additional fees. Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan anytime? Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. When upgrading, you'll get immediate access to new features. When downgrading, changes take effect at your next billing cycle, and you'll retain access to paid features until then.
