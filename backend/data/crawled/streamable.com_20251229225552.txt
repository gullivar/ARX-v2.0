I love it when a web tool provides a simple service seamlessly. @streamable is a super clean #video publishing tool. Host a vid with no surrounding noise but the logo. Embed tool as well. Great place to host and share a video.

Shoutout to @streamable for being so good at converting videos, else I would not have any awesome plays of the game to share with my server members!
