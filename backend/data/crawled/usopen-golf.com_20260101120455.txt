Historical Facts about Shinnecock Hills & the US Open The first edition of the prestigious golf US open tournament was organized in 1895 at the Newport Country Club, where the players competed over a 9-hole course. Horace Rawlins, a 21-years old British golfer, made history that day by winning the first ever US Open tournament. Over the years, the tournament has been organized in many golf courses across America, and this year’s edition will see the event hosted at the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Shinnecock Hills Club is renowned for hosting prominent golf tournaments, has seen many US Open golf scores, and it has continued to do so for more than a century. The 2025 edition of the US Open will be the fifth US Open to be hosted by the club. Therefore, the club will make history by being the first venue to host the US Open in three centuries. It first hosted the event in 1896, which was the second edition of the US Open. James Foulis took home the win by three strokes over the previous edition’s winner, Horace Rowlins. The second time it hosted the event was in 1986, where Raymond Floyd won by two strokes over Lanny Wadkins and Chip Beck. The third time was in 1995, in which Corey Pavin won by two strokes.
