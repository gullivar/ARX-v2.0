NEW FEATURE: Verify past results from this widget What's this fuss about true randomness? Perhaps you have wondered how predictable machines like
    computers can generate randomness.  In reality, most random numbers
    used in computer programs are pseudo-random , which means they
    are generated in a predictable fashion using a mathematical
    formula.  This is fine for many purposes, but it may not be random
    in the way you expect if you're used to dice rolls and lottery drawings. RANDOM.ORG offers true random numbers to anyone on
    the Internet.  The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which
    for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number
    algorithms typically used in computer programs.  People use RANDOM.ORG for holding drawings, lotteries and sweepstakes, to drive online games, for scientific applications and for art and music.
    The service has existed since 1998 and was built by Prof. Mads Haahr of the School of Computer Science
    and Statistics at Trinity College,
    Dublin in Ireland.  Today, RANDOM.ORG is operated by Randomness and Integrity Services Ltd .
