Self-hosting ( e.g. Plex server hosting ) is a fun and rewarding hobby.. until it’s not. You’re always “on call”, you’re on your own when things go wrong, you have to purchase and support your own hardware, connectivity, security and updates. ElfHosted runs all those juicy self-hosted apps for you, taking care of all the plumbing, so that you’re free to simply use the apps, safe in the knowledge that they’re secure, backed up, and automatically updated. 1. Friendly Community Our 5-star-rated Discord community is the hub of our “tribe” – you’ll find like-minded enthusiasts as well as our official support channels, and Spanky-9000, our sometimes-helpful AI bot. 2. We give back Our model shares revenue with Elf-illiated developers, we contribute generously to apps we use, and we host public utilities for the global Plex + Debrid / Stremio communities 3. Modern Stack Our stack is built on Kubernetes, leveraging GitOps and SRE principles to maximize availability and automation. 4. Open Source Our design is open-source , our processes are transparent, and we do it because.. it’ our passion.
