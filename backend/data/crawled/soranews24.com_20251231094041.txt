At the same time, however, many people also have concerns such as: ・“Aren’t they too cramped to sleep comfortably in?” ・“Are they actually clean?” ・“Are they really safe?” Traditional capsule hotels have long carried the image of being “just a place to sleep,” and were not always chosen as a base for travel. Changing this perception is global cabin Yokohama Chinatown, developed by Dormy Inn. Unlike conventional capsule hotels, global cabin Yokohama Chinatown is a next-generation cabin accommodation designed with a strong focus on cleanliness, safety, and comfort. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what makes it so appealing.
