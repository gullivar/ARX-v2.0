Meesho transitioned from Amazon ElastiCache to Redis Cloud on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), here is what I feel this could benefit

@mjovanovictech

Most people think Redis is just used for caching.

But it can do so much more!

@KevinBaldwinSF

Game changer!

@ayshriv

Just integrated Redis with Java and the performance boost is incredible. Blazing-fast caching, session management, and real-time data handling.

Tech Stack: Java + Spring Boot + Redis

Say goodbye to latency.

@hwchase17

In case you missed it: OpenGPTs is an open source alternative to GPTs, where you own and control the infra. In this case, a lot of the infra is built on top of Redis

@deleteman123

This is why I love Redis so much, it's super versatile and powerful. You can use it on almost every scenario.

@advoworks

Redis is awesome

@bytebytego

Most people think Redis is just for caching.

But Redis can do so much more than that. It is good for:

- Session store 
- Distributed lock 
- Counter 
- Rate limiter 
- Ranking/leaderboard

@UnstructuredIO

Redis is a versatile Vector Database, primarily known for its speed, and flexibility. The LangChain Template is a game-changer, offering standard formats for easy deployment with LangServe, simplifying app creation, modification, and understanding.

@StonkyOli

I love redis

@knowclarified

Redis. Yeah. That’s the tweet.

@defunkt

Redis is still one of my favorite software projects. Not only did
@ezmobius introduce me to it, his redis-rb project opened the door for all us Rubyists. Redis solved so many problems for early GitHub.
