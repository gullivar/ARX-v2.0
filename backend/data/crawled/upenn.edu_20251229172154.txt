Late-semester energy everywhere you look

@UOFPENN

This fall, students who are trained pianists studied the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the most influential composers in history. Under the guidance of two Penn professors, the students in the Performance, Analysis, and History class performed Bach's music and learned about the historical and geographical contexts that shaped his music.

@UOFPENN

The last exams are wrapped up. Enjoy the well-deserved break ahead! Here’s to your next chapter.
