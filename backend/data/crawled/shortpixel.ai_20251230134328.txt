Speed up your website.
With ease.

Imagine if there was a tool that could easily make your website faster. Not only that, but it would save you time and effort when dealing with images. This way, you can be unaware of all the complexity behind it. You will not have to worry about delivering optimized "next-gen" images, properly adjust the images size and serve them through a CDN...
Well, with the ShortPixel tools, you can accomplish all of that and more.

Install and forget

Whether you have just one website or manage hundreds of websites, ShortPixel can help. No more worries with editors forgetting to resize the 5 MB image they took with their phone. Or other time-consuming processes before uploading the images to your website.
Just add the images and ShortPixel will do the rest.

SmartCompress for best image quality

ShortPixel is not your average image optimization service. We do not just reduce image quality from 80% to 40% like others do. The result is images that are either under-optimized or over-optimized.
ShortPixel takes a totally different approach. Our goal is to deliver the original-looking images at the smallest possible size. And to achieve that, we take each image and optimize it multiple times with our proprietary algorithms until we have the perfect, smallest possible image.

Next-gen WebP and AVIF formats

While JPEG is still the most popular format, new formats like WebP and AVIF offer better image quality at smaller file sizes. And that means faster websites and therefore better SEO rankings. Who does not want that?!
ShortPixel takes all the complexity away from you and makes everything simple: with just a few clicks you can convert all your JPG/PNG images to WebP/AVIF and make them available to the right browsers.

A significant portion of a website's data usually consists of images. Image optimization refines images, shortens loading times, and reduces the load on network resources, including data usage on mobile data plans.

Image optimization will also boost your SEO performance, as search engines factor in page loading speed when ranking websites. A faster loading page means more page views, a pleasant user experience, and better search rankings.

ShortPixel is an image optimization service that uses advanced compression technology to reduce the image size without affecting the before/after quality, so your pages will load faster.
