“An online pet food company that makes feeding real food to dogs really easy.”

Customer reviews

“It never sits on a shelf. All you do is open the pack and pour.”
“Owners can get healthy dog food shipped right to their door.”
You shouldn’t be the only one eating healthy.

Like you, we love our pets and care about their health. That’s why we created The Farmer’s Dog — a service that delivers gently cooked, freshly made pet food with balanced recipes, guided by science, and driven by love.

Real Food

Human-grade meat and veggies in simple recipes, made for dogs

Human Grade
Safety

Safety and quality never before available to pets

Gently Cooked

Maintain whole food and nutritional integrity

Vet Developed

Nutrition that exceeds industry standards (AAFCO)

Build Personalized Plan
It’s time for a fresh
approach to pet food.By sending food directly to you, we can invest in better ingredients and fresher food. Quality never found in a store. Learn more about the importance of real food.
“Meals”

Powders like “Chicken Meal” can contain meat from diseased livestock.

Preservatives

Natural and/or artificial preservatives can keep pet foods shelf-stable for years.

Brown Pellets

Kibble is extremely processed regardless of the ingredient claims (or pictures).

Label Tricks

Foods can hide behind misleading bags. “Made with beef” can mean just 3% beef.

How we made
pet food healthy:
Tested on Humans

Human-grade food in human-friendly packaging. Less processing, higher safety standards, and easy serving — just open and pour!

Personalized Plans

A vet-designed plan is customized to your dog’s individual needs. Meals are pre-made and pre-portioned to their calorie needs based on the profile you create.

Delivered Within Days

Your food is made fresh and quickly frozen to lock in all the nutrients. No preservatives. Never stored on a shelf for years.

Better for them.
Easier for you.

Skip the stores, preservatives, and retail markups. Our vet-developed plans guide you to the best diet, while perfectly-timed frozen deliveries make sure you never run out.

🔊Made dad film and edit my morning @thefarmersdog. Now watch me eat! 🔊
Juliana C.

Piper (3 year old Italian Grey Hound and Chihuahua mix)

I wanted to pass along this photo of my dog, Piper. I figured maybe it could help show the real difference a good food can make! She used to eat “high quality” kibble, and had awful tear staining. She hasn’t had a tear staining issue since switching to your food, and now is all lean muscle!
ottozurich
Are you ready for it??? #imafarmersdog Otto is tired of looking cute and just wants to eat!!! Finally found a food he actually wants and tolerates!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌 @thefarmersdog
Robert F.

Myah (14 year old Unknown Mix Breed)

Our 14 year old could hardly get up and walk due to so much pain in her hips, after eating your food she’s now running again! I was hoping it would help her but I wasn’t expecting that big of an improvement. Good food reduced her inflammation. You truly are what you eat.
pawsofsimba
It’s hard work supervising in the kitchen but someone has to do it! Can’t wait to dig into my @thefarmersdog meal 🍲 #imafarmersdog #realfood
Alison G.

Max (3 year old Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and Labrador Retriever mix)

I cannot believe how fast my dog devoured his first meal! He is notorious for being a picky eater, but wow, what a turnaround. Thank you so much for helping me maintain my dog's newfound clean eating routine. Absolutely remarkable!

Anikan loved The Farmers Dog on first bite and I quickly fell in love with this healthy, easy and convenient brand.
Nicole R.

Ginger (6 year old Jack Russel Terrier mix)

My dog was beginning a downward slope. We decided to make a change to her food...and we chose Farmer’s Dog...The difference is ASTOUNDING. She eats with gusto, her energy levels are back up, her teeth and coat are even better quality...she’s like a whole different dog. I honestly feel that Farmer’s Dog saved her.
barkley_theboxer
I’m so excited to try @thefarmersdog ... now I can have real human-grade food! Thanks mom and dad for caring so much about my health! 🍖 #imafarmersdog
Eileen H.

Dani (2 year old French Bulldog)

Dani is the perfect lap dog, but her gas was so bad I could barely hold her. Not to mention her loose stools and bouts of diarrhea. We tried all kinds of dog food..Nothing really worked. Until The Farmers Dog! What a difference. I can't thank you guys enough! And I am sure Dani would love to thank you too!
schurmansa
Best day of the month for these two!! Their food is real, fresh, healthy, & delivered right to our door...what’s not to love? ❤️🐶🐾
David G.

Maggie (15 year old Chihuahua)

Maggie loves the food and acts like a puppy! She had a lot of GI issues...which have greatly improved. She looks forward to the food and is excited where ever she sees the box! I would like to express my gratitude to you. The change in Maggie is unbelievable and makes my family, myself and her so happy.
fit_kels
Flynn devoured his @thefarmersdog dinner!! He usually nibbles at his meals for hours before finishing it. I'd say this was a success! #iamafarmersdog
Mary G.

Jingle (12 year old Jack Russel Terrior and Rat Terrior mix)

You all make it so easy to be one of your greatest fans. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I've watched Jingle's health return 100% in a matter of days, after I was desperately afraid I would lose her. I attribute that solely to The Farmer’s Dog and you will never know how grateful I am!
chubbypubby
Pubby is SOOO picky and his stomach is a little sensitive. We made the switch to a fresh food diet...Pubby loves it and we do too! We’re all happy now. #imafarmersdog 👩🏻‍🌾🐶
Ann G.

Sasha (12 year old Samoyed)

Sasha is just thriving on her food. For the last two years, she has been slowing down quite a lot. After two weeks of being on her new food, she has more energy, looks a lot more interested in what is going around her and literally hops. I am so pleased with this food, it makes her happy!
kaitlinvilasuso
😜This right here is the face of a now healthy, happy, 10+ pounds lighter Maddy thanks to @thefarmersdog .. 🙌🏻
Sarah C.

Lola (12 year old Labrador Retriever)

Lola has put on a lot of weight in her old age, despite a strict diet and exercise. The weight never came off. Our vet ran every test imaginable on her. Since switching to Farmers Dog, she’s lost 10lbs and is playing again! It’s been nothing short of miraculous. I’m so happy that we found you guys!

GIVE IT TO ME! GIVE IT TO ME! #imafarmersdog
Tisa M.

Lizzie (10 year old Dachshund)

I believe changing to your food has helped some dry patches Izzie's had on her ears. They seem softer. She already had a shiny coat, but wow!—Her coat is feeling silkier. People think that she’s much younger than she is. She’s a forever puppy, we like to call her. So, let me be clear: WE LOVE YOU!
wearerockyandonyx
3 weeks into my @thefarmersdog fresh food and I am doing so great!! I have tons of energy, my fur is shiny and soft, and I’m maintaining my physique! It’s SUPER yummy!! 👅👅
Lisa K.

Annabelle (12 year old Coon Hound), Casper (8 year old Coonhound and Bloodhound mix)

I now spend (more) on food but vet bills have dropped. All their vets attribute the pups' improved health to your food!
smalldogsadie
Hi my name is Sadie, and I’m the worlds PICKIEST DOG. But today I got to try @thefarmersdog and completely emptied my bowl ;)
Jennie M.

Oliver (6 year old French Bulldog)

The Farmer’s Dog food has helped COMPLETELY RID MY DOG OF FOOD ALLERGIES. I cannot express how critical that has been in enhancing my dog’s quality of life, and easing my wallet from all the critical vet visits. Thanks to Farmers Dog.
safarimou
Do you guys have the same excitement as I do going to sleep thinking about what you’re going to eat in the morning?! Thank you @thefarmersdog for this delicious recipe!!!
Gwen B.

Ben (15 year old Chihuahua)

Benjamin has worried us for years as he won’t eat. I have bought every soft and kibble dog food available. I put your food in the bowl and he gobbled it. We are now half through the third packet and he still loves it. He will sit at his bowl and beg. I am amazed. Thank you for whatever magic happens in your kitchen.
winston_and_heidi
More please!!! Nom nom nom 😋 why is it so long between meal times?? #imafarmersdog
Natalie B.

Liam (7 year old Unknown mixed-breed)

Liam (was) 73lbs. He had no energy to do anything. I knew I needed to change up his food...it's been about 4.5 months (on The Farmer’s Dog), and look at the difference! He's 8 years old and has his puppy energy back which is good and bad!..Thank you so much for helping me whip this fat boy back in shape!
twodapperdoods
We used to beg our parents for their food, now they beg us for ours 🙏🏻 🥘
Michael D.

Lucy (10 year old Cockapoo)

Lucy has cancer and we almost put her down. As a last ditch effort, we tried your food and she has come back to life...we know she lost weight (too). She is jumping playing and acting like a puppy. Thank you for giving me more time with my precious dog.
lilyxlafleur
