Been using granola.so a bit lately; it generates the best meeting notes of anything I've tried so far. Not sure how they did that.

Granola is so good.

I hope they introduce a marketplace of one-click integrations. I got use cases! :)

I get uncharacteristically excited about group Zoom meetings now

Why? Because the payoff is seeing @meetgranola really work its magic and generate incredible meeting notes seconds after we adjourn

If you aren’t using @meetgranola for your meetings you are seriously missing out. 

Incredible product.

It's actually unbelievable how good granola.ai is.

It replaces writing documents. It's the killer user research tool. The ability to "chat with the transcript" to come back to a point that was made is pure gold. There's no going back to pre-granola days.

The two AI tools I use most often right now: 
- Granola.ai
- Howie.com 

Both are 10/10.  

Granola has solved meeting notes for me and Howie has saved me dozens of hours of scheduling headaches

I don't think I've ever gotten more thanks from people recommending an app than I have for @meetgranola. 

Everyone thinks they have a good meeting notes app, but it's only once they use Granola they realise what they've been missing.

Just used Granola AI for the first time to take notes for me. Totally insane product. Highly recommend. Not an investor sadly.

Granola is one of the best made “AI” apps that I've used this year.

If you are in a lot of meetings, this is a gamechanger. It takes notes in all those meetings for you, so you only need to add what's in your head.

It's minimal, fast, with no setup. It. just. works.
