Enjoy total peace of mind with award-winning live GPS tracking that’s faster than ever before.

Know the difference.
Track with confidence.

Not all trackers measure up. Fi gives real-time GPS tracking with no guesswork or gaps.

Microchips don’t track

Chipped dogs need to be safely brought to animal control or a vet for scanning. Fi always knows where they are.

AirTags aren’t meant for dogs

Limited waterproofing and short-range iPhone tracking fall short. Fi uses GPS to track your dog—no matter how far.

The Pack Awaits

Join the Fi community and connect with dog lovers across the country.

All the dog news you’ll obsess over,
in one place, twice a month.
