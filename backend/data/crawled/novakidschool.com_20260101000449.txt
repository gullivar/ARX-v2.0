Matthew Indonesia We have been taking Novakids online classes for a long time, and my child is still always enthusiastic every time he takes a lesson. Behind that, the Novakid team is very helpful and provides a quick response if there are difficulties in scheduling or if there is an error in the connection. So you don't need to hesitate anymore to register your child at Novakid. Rita mum Taiwan Thanks to the teacher for his hard work, he allowed Rita to slowly form the list into sentences and led Rita to read it step by step. Mom really feels that Rita has made a lot of progress. Thank you, teacher. Rita begins to look forward to the arrival of the next class Ashraf U.A.E. We booked a free class for my daughter who's so shy and less interactive in her class, the teacher was so friendly and could made her interact so easly, we were so happy to see her speaking, understanding and even answering questions!? Great job she did, we decided to make her join Nova kids without hisitation. Ysaline Taiwan After trying many English learning platforms, Novakid is definitely one of the best! It’s interesting and interactive. The teachers are professional and passionate. The materials are well-designed and fun! We even tried the small International group and learned with other kids, which was an amazing way to learn English. My daughter really enjoys taking classes with Novakid! Janice Hong Kong Novakid is an excellent online school for learning English. My daughter has started learning English at age of 4 with Novakid. It has been 3.5 years of learning. She can express herself more with English during lessons. I hope she can gain more confidence by speaking more. Thank you! Sladjana W Czech Republic My children love Novakid! Not only do they have lessons with teachers but also there are many games where they can practise English whenever they want. They play games, watch videos, have lessons... The lessons are recorded, so we can also watch the lessons' videos whenever we want and that way practise more without extra cost. 1 6 Try for FREE You will get Convenient parent’s account We use our website to organise classes.

Andrea South Africa Experience: 5 years Clinton South Africa Experience: 5 years Roxanne South Africa Experience: 10 years Josse UK Experience: 15 years Get started for FREE Novakid has been recognized globally Questions and answers Why should we choose Novakid? ✓ All Novakid's teaching is in English. The children quickly get used to communicating without using their native language. ✓ We teach in the child-friendly language of play, through comics, mini-games and virtual tours. There are no grades, grammar tables or boring exercises. ✓ We adapt the programme to the child's level. Every few lessons, the teacher reviews their progress and either assigns an additional lesson for extra practice or moves on to the next topic. ✓ The child receives 100% of the teacher's attention. The teacher corrects their pronunciation and explains difficult topics as many times as necessary. ✓ You get everything in one place: the learning platform, timetable, homework and a library of useful materials. There's no need to buy textbooks or download additional programs. What are lessons at Novakid like? The session lasts approximately 40 minutes: 5 minutes of pre-lesson activities and revision exercises + 25 minutes of active speaking practice with the teacher + 10 minutes of follow-up learning games to reinforce the material. Lessons use a virtual whiteboard with colourful slides, embedded videos and games. If the child has trouble understanding something, the teacher uses facial expressions and gestures to explain it. For completed tasks, the child is rewarded with stars. After the lesson, the teacher leaves feedback in the parent's account and assigns homework. Everything is made accessible and enjoyable for the child. How should we prepare for the trial lesson? For the lesson, you will need a desktop or laptop with a stable internet connection and somewhere quiet. 📵 IMPORTANT: We do not recommend using a smartphone, as the small screen makes it hard for the child to do the tasks set by the teacher. On the day of the lesson, log into your Parent's account 15–20 minutes before the scheduled start. ✓ Run through the audio/video test. ✓ Watch the teacher's video profile and introductory video about the upcoming lesson together with your child. ✓ Done! Get ready for 25 minutes of fun and learning with a great teacher! What happens in the trial lesson? The lesson begins with an introduction. During the lesson, the teacher assesses the child's knowledge without them noticing and awards stars for correct answers. TIP: Be there for the first lesson and support your child. To sign up for a free trial lesson, submit a request and wait for a detailed email with recommendations from us. If you can't attend, cancel the lesson or reschedule it in your account. We would be grateful if you could do this at least 8 hours before the scheduled start time. Will my child understand the teacher if the lesson is entirely in English? Children begin to understand the teacher and repeat after them from the first lessons. Even if the child is completely new to it, the teacher knows exactly how to visually illustrate a thought or word in English. To do so, they use slides with pictures, toys, facial expressions and gestures. And to help the child memorize new words, the teacher uses the TPR (Total Physical Response) method — memorization through movement . Watch this video to see what this looks like in practice. How does the Novakid game method help with language learning? Especially for kids, we've created Novakid Game World , a personal area in the style of a video game, with almost everything in English. The child completes interactive tasks, watches comics and competes with other students. With the rewards they earn, they can upgrade their avatar, which really gets them engaged. As a result, the child enjoys studying, forms a useful habit and remembers things better and faster than in school lessons. What qualifications do your teachers have? We have over 3,000 experienced certified teachers in our team. Each has their own unique personality and teaching style. There's an ideal teacher for everyone, even the shyest or most capricious child. We take recruitment seriously: our teachers must have a professional certificate and at least 1 year experience of working with children. We also pay special attention to their pronunciation to make sure their accent is not too strong. All our teachers do an internship before starting work with us, and then attend regular professional development training. How can I track my child's progress? In the Achievements section of your Parent's account. This contains all the topics by level. You can see which your child has finished and what they still need to do to complete the level. In the teacher's feedback after each lesson. Here, the teacher specifies what your child has done well, and what they need to work on. From video recordings of lessons. Watch the recordings (click 🎦 in the teacher's feedback) and compare your child's progress BEFORE and AFTER the start of lessons. You can read the learning summary after each unit review. Follow the updates in the news feed in your account and enjoy your child's progress with us! Do children get a certificate at end of their studies? At the end of each completed level, the child receives a colourful certificate from Novakid. This is a good thing for them to have and the first step towards international language exams. It's also a great way to show them that they can achieve their goals — which means they can achieve anything! How do we continue studying after the trial lesson? Choose a convenient learning pace and book lessons. We'll support you all the way.1. Purchase a subscription in your personal account. 2. Choose a teacher — keep the teacher from your trial lesson, or choose a new one! At Novakid, you can always find an experienced teacher for your child's level and personality. 3.

We offer subscriptions for 3, 6 or 12 months. You can pay in one go or in equal monthly instalments, by bank transfer or card. TIP: For fast results, we recommend scheduling 2–3 lessons per week . Do this and you will see progress in just 2 months! How do I get a discount for the courses? You can get discounts, cashback offers, bonus lessons and more by following us on social media.
