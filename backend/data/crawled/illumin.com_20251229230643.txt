“The illumin AI was above benchmark in delivering incremental return on advertising spend. Additionally, we were able to determine consumers who went through an entirely connected journey had a higher AOV than users who were exposed to a singular stage. This would have been much harder to uncover without the illumin journey canvas.”

Josh Park
Director of Performance Marketing, Purple

“illumin really looks at the customer journey across various points of entry. It allows us to target consumers appropriately whether they’re at the beginning of searching or much further down the funnel — making for more meaningful interactions.”

Edward Gold
