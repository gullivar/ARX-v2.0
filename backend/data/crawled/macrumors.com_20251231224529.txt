Move Right Will the Apple Pencil Work With the iPhone Fold? Tuesday December 30, 2025 3:52 pm PST by Juli Clover Apple plans to enter the foldable smartphone market in September 2026, debuting its first foldable iPhone . We've heard multiple rumors about the design of the upcoming device, but little has been revealed about the operating system or the software features. Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will be around 5.4 inches when closed, and approximately 7.6 inches when open, giving it a 4:3 aspect ratio. We did a video featuring a rough ‌iPhone‌ Fold mockup at those dimensions yesterday, which provides an idea of what the device will look like. play Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. When unfolded, the upcoming ‌iPhone‌ will be bigger than any ‌iPhone‌ to date, and not too far off in size from the original iPad mini . The current ‌iPad mini‌ has an 8.3-inch screen size, but the first models had a 7.9-inch display. Since the ‌iPhone‌ Fold's inner display will be close to an iPad in size, will it run iOS or iPadOS? Will it work like a standard ‌iPhone‌ when the display is closed, and an ‌iPad‌ when it's open? Or will it get something in between? We haven't heard much about iOS 27 as of yet or what Apple has in store for the ‌iPhone‌ Fold, so it's still a mystery. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman says that iOS 27 will lay the foundation for the foldable ‌iPhone‌ and future foldables, but that's about it. With a larger display, the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will probably support some kind of split screen view or multitasking option, perhaps even adopting Slide Over. Apple Pencil support for a 7.6-inch display could make sense, but the ‌iPhone‌ Fold's display will be an awkward middle size between an ‌iPhone‌ and an ‌iPad‌. We haven't heard rumors that the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will work with the ‌Apple Pencil‌, but we also haven't heard rumors that it won't. ‌Apple Pencil‌ support could be useful for quick note taking, sketches, signing documents, editing photos and videos, and more. Steve Jobs famously said "Nobody wants a stylus," but in the years since he touted the ergonomics of the finger, the stylus has evolved. The ‌Apple Pencil‌ isn't one of the tiny plastic pens or imprecise rubber-tipped styluses that were around back in 2007 when Jobs commented on them. It's a writing implement that accurately mimics a pen or a pencil, and it feels natural to use. Samsung's foldables supported the optional S Pen for many years, but the latest Galaxy Z Fold7 dropped the feature for a thinner and lighter design, which might not bode well for Apple offering the functionality. Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone‌ Fold is going to be somewhere around 4.5mm thick when unfolded, which will make it thinner than Apple's 5.1mm iPad Pro , the thinnest Apple device to date. Some dedicated Samsung Galaxy Fold users are unhappy with the feature's removal , so there are definitely foldable smartphone customers out there who like the flexibility of being able to use a stylus. Rumors suggest that Samsung is considering bringing S Pen support back to the next-generation Galaxy Fold, which will, coincidentally, have a shorter, wider design to match the iPhone Fold . If Apple implements ‌Apple Pencil‌ support and Samsung doesn't, it's possible Apple will draw some switchers who don't want to use a foldable without a pen option. The opposite is also a possibility, so Apple could lose customers who don't want a foldable without a pen. Google didn't design a stylus for the Pixel Fold, but it did implement support for the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI), so the device works with third-party USI pens. USI pens don't have the same functionality as the ‌Apple Pencil‌, lacking features like pressure sensitivity, but the basic stylus functionality is there for those who want it. Apple could do something similar to Google. Add support for the ‌Apple Pencil‌ for those who want it, without making it a primary marketing point. That would make the ‌Apple Pencil‌ available for those who want the extra functionality, but it wouldn't be a necessity. Apple could also design an ‌iPhone‌ Fold-specific ‌Apple Pencil‌ that is sized to the device and able to be charged with it, but it all depends on how Apple wants to market the ‌iPhone‌ Fold. If it's marketed as an ‌iPhone‌, ‌Apple Pencil‌ support is unlikely. Apple has long championed a touch-first approach, and no ‌Apple Pencil‌ support for the ‌iPhone‌ clearly separates it from the ‌iPad‌. If it's marketed as an ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ hybrid device, ‌Apple Pencil‌ support seems like more of a possibility. Apple might not be able to implement ‌Apple Pencil‌ support at all because of technical limitations. Rumors suggest that the ‌iPhone‌ Fold is so thin that it doesn't have the space for the TrueDepth camera hardware for Face ID , so Apple is instead adding a Touch ID button to the device. With space at such a premium, a digitizer layer for the ‌Apple Pencil‌ is probably impossible. Apple also needs to take into account how an ‌Apple Pencil‌ would impact ‌iPhone‌ Fold features like the crease in the middle, and that might add too much complication. Even if the first-generation ‌iPhone‌ Fold doesn't get ‌Apple Pencil‌ support, it could be a feature that Apple adds in the future as display technology improves. Do you want ‌Apple Pencil‌ support for the ‌iPhone‌ Fold? Let us know in the comments below.

In a video, several Apple Fitness+ trainers are shown holding up newspapers with headlines related to Apple Fitness+. What's Apple Fitness+ Planning for the New Year? Something Big is Coming to Apple Fitness+ The Countdown Begins. Apple Fitness+ 2026 is Almost Here 2026 Plans Still Under Wraps-For Now There are rumors that an AI-based Health+ service will be introduced at some point in 2026, but the Apple Fitness+ post may simply be referencing some kind of fitness program or fitness promotion that's designed to help people meet their New Year's Resolutions. It sounds like an announcement is planned for January 1, 2026. The Health+ service that's in the works will supposedly incorporate AI for personalized health recommendations and health coaching. Health+ will rely on the LLM version of Siri that Apple has planned, which isn't expected until iOS 26.4 in the spring, so we're probably not hearing about the service in January. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Apple Fitness+ (@applefitnessplus) Apple has a "Ring in the New Year" Apple Watch activity challenge that kicks off on January 1 , so the Fitness+ announcement could be related to that.

The Global Fund this week said that Apple raised a total of $3 million for the organization, which is dedicated to fighting HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in developing countries. Apple capped donations at $3 million, so that means Apple customers raised the total possible amount through their purchases. Apple ran the promotion from November 28 through December 7 to fund critical health programs that save lives. Apple has long supported The Global Fund with similar promotions and through sales of devices manufactured in (PRODUCT)RED colors. Apple has not offered any of its iPhones or accessories in (PRODUCT)RED colorways since the launch of the 2022 iPhone 14 models, but it does raise money each December in honor of World AIDS Day. Apple has raised more than $250 million for The Global Fund during its 19-year partnership with the (RED) brand.

There are multiple discussions about the issue on Reddit, the MacRumors forums , and Apple's Support Community , where affected users say there is a noticeable static noise "like an old radio." Some people report hearing it when playing audio and turning the volume down, while others say the static is audible without anything playing from the speakers. In some cases, there is a low crackle or a hiss when scrolling through webpages when the ‌iPhone‌ is charging, and some people hear the noise at low volumes even when the ‌iPhone‌ isn't on a charger. Affected users report that the noise can be heard with chargers of all types, including Apple's official chargers. MagSafe charging causes the problem as well, but users report that the static noise is quieter. Unplugging the ‌iPhone‌ from the charger eliminates the sound for users who are experiencing the static noise when charging. play Some ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ users have exchanged their devices for new ones, but have run into the same issue. One Reddit user has been in contact with Apple support, and says the issue has been forwarded to Apple engineers. Apple is apparently working on a fix, but the iOS updates that have been released so far do not appear to solve the problem. The sound is subtle according to most reports, so it may be a widespread issue that only those sensitive to the noise have noticed. Show Full Article 123 comments Report: Apple's AI Strategy Could Finally Pay Off in 2026 Tuesday December 30, 2025 9:01 am PST by Hartley Charlton Apple's restrained artificial intelligence strategy may pay off in 2026 amid the arrival of a revamped Siri and concerns around the AI market "bubble" bursting, The Information argues. The speculative report notes that Apple has taken a restrained approach with AI innovations compared with peers such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta, which are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers, chips, and large language model training. This has fueled criticism that Apple is falling behind in the AI space, particularly as Siri has significantly lagged behind more advanced, capable, and reliable conversational systems. The report argues that market sentiment toward AI spending is beginning to show signs of skepticism, with questions emerging over whether such large investments can be justified by near-term revenue. Against that backdrop, Apple's decision to limit AI-specific capital expenditures has left it with more than $130 billion in cash and marketable securities, giving the company the option to pursue acquisitions or partnerships if valuations of AI startups fall. Apple's biggest AI-related move in 2026 will be the long-anticipated overhaul of ‌Siri‌, which is expected to arrive in the spring. The updated assistant is set to be more conversational and capable of completing multi-step tasks. To power it, Apple is believed to be adopting Google's Gemini , reflecting an internal view that large language models may become commoditized and not worth the cost of large-scale proprietary development. The iPhone is said to be a key strategic advantage. Unlike AI companies that rely on standalone apps or web services, Apple can distribute AI features directly through software updates and system-level integrations across its devices. Efforts by AI companies to build competing hardware face major challenges in manufacturing, distribution, and ecosystem development, areas where Apple has very strong footholds. The Information also points to recent leadership changes as part of Apple's effort to refocus its AI work. ‌Siri‌ has been placed under Mike Rockwell , who was responsible for launching the Vision Pro headset, following significant delays to the assistant's overhaul. In addition, Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea announced his retirement earlier in December, with parts of his organization redistributed into product-focused teams amid internal concerns about a lack of clear product direction. While Apple has a history of early but uneven AI efforts, including the original launch of ‌Siri‌ in 2011, The Information argues that these shortcomings have not materially harmed its core businesses. 2026 may be an inflection point in which Apple's cautious strategy could appear prescient if enthusiasm for large-scale AI spending continues to cool and the company finally delivers a more capable version of ‌Siri‌.

Tag: Japan Show Full Article 13 comments The 5 Most Important Apple Software Features Introduced This Year Tuesday December 30, 2025 1:00 am PST by Hartley Charlton 2025 was a significant year of advancement for Apple's software, with a noticeable focus on visual design, productivity, and communication. While Apple introduced and continued to iterate on a wide range of features throughout the year, several additions stood out for their scope and practical impact across multiple devices. As the year comes to an end, these five new features provide a useful lens for weighing up what the company focused on this year and how far its platforms evolved in 2025. Liquid Glass This year's most immediately visible change is the introduction of Liquid Glass, a new system-wide visual design language applied across Apple's operating systems. Liquid Glass replaces many of the flat, opaque UI elements introduced over the past decade with layered translucency, subtle refraction, and motion-responsive surfaces that react to underlying content. Navigation bars, sidebars, control panels, and system overlays now appear as semi-transparent sheets that blend into their surroundings rather than sitting on top of them. Apple framed this as a unifying material across platforms rather than a purely aesthetic refresh, with the same visual logic appearing on iPhone , iPad , Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV . In practice, it is one of Apple's biggest visual redesigns since the original iOS 7 shift away from skeuomorphism, and it signals a renewed focus on making the interface feel fresh, spatial, playful, and responsive rather than static. Revamped iPad Multitasking On the ‌iPad‌, the most consequential change is the introduction of an all-new multitasking system with windows and a macOS-style Menu Bar and cursor in iPadOS 26 . Apps can now run in freely resizable windows rather than being constrained to fixed split-screen layouts, allowing multiple overlapping windows to coexist on screen. Alongside this, a Menu Bar appears at the top of the display when invoked, exposing app commands in a structured, searchable format similar to macOS. Instead of asking users to adapt desktop workflows to a touch-first model, Apple has now explicitly imported desktop interaction styles into iPadOS, addressing a significant number of user complaints about the software limitations of the ‌iPad‌. For users who want to use the ‌iPad‌ with true multitasking and desktop-style workflows, this is one of the most substantive capability upgrades the platform has ever received. More Powerful Mac Spotlight On the Mac, Spotlight received its most extensive overhaul to date, transforming it from a passive search tool into an actions-first command interface, similar to third-party apps like Alfred or Raycast. Spotlight in macOS Tahoe can now execute hundreds of actions directly from the search field. Users can create and edit notes, send emails and messages, start timers, run Shortcuts, adjust system settings, and perform app-specific commands, without opening the corresponding app. Apple also redesigned Spotlight's results presentation with richer, more structured browsing views. Instead of returning a flat list of matches, Spotlight now surfaces grouped results for files, applications, actions, and suggestions, allowing users to scan and refine results more quickly. Spotlight now includes a built-in clipboard history, allowing users to view and reuse previously copied text or images directly from the Spotlight interface. Apple also integrated an app library-style view, providing a centralized, searchable overview of all installed applications. Live Translation Another major addition is Live Translation. Real-time translation now operates inside Messages, FaceTime , and the Phone app, translating both text and spoken audio during conversations. In Messages, incoming and outgoing text can be translated inline. In ‌FaceTime‌, Live Translation provides real-time translated captions during video calls, allowing participants to speak naturally while reading translations as the conversation unfolds. In phone calls, spoken dialogue can be translated in near real time, with translated audio and on-screen text presented during the call. Apple also extended Live Translation to AirPods, enabling real-time spoken translation directly through the earbuds during in-person conversations. When Live Translation is active, speech from another language can be translated on the paired ‌iPhone‌ and played back in the user's AirPods, while the user's responses can be translated and spoken aloud by the ‌iPhone‌ for the other participant. Communication Screening and Hold Assist Call Screening allows the ‌iPhone‌ to automatically answer calls from unknown numbers on the user's behalf. The system asks the caller to identify themselves and explain the reason for the call, then presents the user with a live transcript of the response before the call is connected. With Hold Assist, when a user is placed on hold during a phone call, the ‌iPhone‌ can remain in the queue on their behalf and monitor the call until a live agent becomes available. Once the system detects that the call has resumed, it notifies the user to return to the conversation. In Messages, Apple introduced more aggressive screening for unknown senders. Messages from numbers that are not in the user's contacts are automatically routed into a separate area, keeping potential spam and scam attempts out of the main conversation list.

In a series of "quit quitting" spots, Apple Watch owners run away from a bed, a recliner, and a bar stool. Each spot includes a glimpse of the Apple Watch Workout app and messages that the device provides while running.

Matter integration has been available for the Roomba Combo 10 Max since earlier this year, but existing Roomba Plus 500 Combo, Roomba Max 700 Vac, and Roomba Max 700 Combo vacuums can get Matter support through a firmware update . Matter has not yet been re-added for the Roomba Combo J7 and J9. Matter-enabled Roomba vacuums can be added to the Home app on devices running iOS 18.4 or higher, as long as a Home hub is available ( Apple TV or HomePod ). The Home app doesn't support the full suite of features available with robot vacuums, but basic commands are available. Vacuums can be set to vacuum and mop an entire home, or a specific room or area with ‌Siri‌ voice commands. Once added to the Home app, a Roomba vacuum with Matter can be set to clean automatically with automations and can integrate with other HomeKit devices. You could, for example, set the Roomba to vacuum whenever you leave the house, or at a certain time. Automations can be triggered by presence, time, sensors, or when an accessory like a light is activated. Apple added support for Matter-connected robot vacuums in iOS 18.4 earlier this year. Several companies have since come out with Matter options, including Roborock, Ecovacs, Switchbot, and Roomba. iRobot's added Matter support comes as the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier in December. iRobot has been sold to Picea Robotics, a Chinese company that already manufactures some of the Roomba devices. The acquisition is expected to be completed by February 2026, and iRobot says there will be no disruption in app functionality, product support, or customer programs. Going forward, iRobot will remain a private company owned by Picea, and the Roomba brand will continue with new models planned for the future. (Thanks, Max!)

A 3D designer created an iPhone Fold design based on rumors, and we printed it out to see how it compares to Apple's current iPhones. play Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The foldable ‌iPhone‌ is going to be smaller than any current ‌iPhone‌ when it's closed, and it'll be shorter than Samsung's Galaxy foldables. Rumors suggest it'll be somewhere around 5.4 inches, which would make it as small as the now-discontinued ‌iPhone‌ 13 mini. When open, the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will be somewhere around 7.6 inches. It'll be smaller than the iPad mini , but the display will be larger than any ‌iPhone‌ to date. The ‌iPhone‌ Fold will be short and wide, for a book-like form factor and usage experience with a 4:3 aspect ratio. We don't know the dimensions of the foldable ‌iPhone‌ yet, and rumors vary somewhat, so the 3D print isn't an exact representation of the device that Apple has in the works. The 3D model was based on a mockup created by MacRumors reader iZac, who based his design on rumors that were circulating in May. He mocked up a 5.49-inch display when the ‌iPhone‌ is closed, and a 7.76-inch display when it's open. There are no sizing rumors that are significantly off from those figures, but we've heard 5.3 to 5.5 inches for the outer (closed) display, and 7.6 to 7.8 inches for the inner (open) display. iZac's design also uses a 4.8mm thickness for the device when it's unfolded, and rumors about thickness vary too. It could be 4.8mm, or it could be as thin as 4.5mm. The hinge on the 3D print is just a stand-in, because we don't know what Apple's hinge will look like. Rumors suggest that Apple spent a lot of time and effort creating a hinge that will make the crease between the two halves of the device almost invisible. We also don't know what the camera area will look like. Even though the 3D print isn't a spot on representation of the device that Apple is planning to launch, it's close enough to the rumors to provide a good idea of how the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will look and feel in the hand. Do you plan to get an ‌iPhone‌ Fold? Let us know in the comments below.

The application follows a decision in October by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which concluded that Apple abused its dominant position by charging excessive commissions on ‌App Store‌ purchases between 2015 and 2024. The tribunal found that Apple's control over app distribution on iPhones and iPads allowed it to impose commission rates of up to 30% that were higher than would have prevailed in a competitive market, resulting in consumer harm estimated to be worth £1.5 billion. The case was raised as a collective action on behalf of approximately 36 million British consumers. Under UK collective proceedings law, eligible consumers are automatically included unless they opt out, meaning that anyone in the UK who made ‌App Store‌ purchases during the relevant period could be entitled to compensation if the ruling stands. In its judgment, CAT said Apple should have charged lower commissions, estimating that rates of around 17.5% on app sales and 10% on in-app purchases would have been more appropriate. The tribunal acknowledged that this assessment relied on "informed guesswork" based on the evidence presented. Apple strongly disputes that approach. After the October ruling, the company sought permission from CAT to appeal, but the tribunal refused in November , concluding that Apple had not met the legal threshold to challenge its decision. Apple has now applied directly to the Court of Appeal, which has the authority to grant permission even where CAT has declined. Apple said it disagrees with the ruling and argues that the tribunal took a flawed view of the app economy. In a previous statement responding to the decision, the company said the ‌App Store‌ operates in a "thriving and competitive app economy" and provides developers and consumers with security, privacy protections, and access to a large marketplace. Apple also noted that most developers now pay a reduced 15% commission and that the ‌App Store‌ facilitated more than $55 billion in sales in the UK last year. If Apple's appeal is rejected and the ruling is upheld, the £1.5 billion award will be distributed among eligible UK consumers, with individual payouts likely to be relatively small but collectively significant.

While the United States will still apply new tariffs on semiconductor imports from China, the effective tariff rate will be set at zero for approximately 18 months, according to a Federal Register filing (via CNBC ). The tariff rate will increase on June 23, 2027, with the specific percentage to be announced at least 30 days in advance. For Apple, the decision removes the near-term risk of higher import costs on a wide range of chips used across its products. While Apple designs its own A-series and M-series processors, which are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Taiwan, the company continues to rely on China-based suppliers for many other semiconductor components, including power management integrated circuits, display driver chips, connectivity controllers, and various supporting logic chips embedded throughout its devices. Many of those components would fall within the scope of the China-specific semiconductor tariff once the rate increases in 2027. Although the tariff is technically being imposed immediately, the zero percent rate functions as a delay mechanism rather than a suspension. This preserves the legal and regulatory framework needed to raise tariffs at a later date, reducing immediate trade friction while retaining leverage in future negotiations, and provides clarity to firms like Apple amid long-term supply chain decisions. The timing is particularly significant for Apple because of its ongoing efforts to diversify manufacturing and sourcing beyond China. Apple previously faced concerns about a potential 100% semiconductor import tariff . In August, Apple committed $600 billion toward domestic manufacturing and infrastructure efforts.

The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit launched in 2021 in partnership with Michigan State University. The tuition-free program offers a 10-month course focused on building apps for Apple platforms, providing students with MacBooks, iPhones, mentorship, and monthly stipends intended to cover living costs. The academy has welcomed over 1,700 students since 2021, with about 600 completing the 10-month program. An investigation by WIRED found that nearly $30 million has been spent on the academy over four years, equating to roughly $20,000 per student. Previously undisclosed records show Apple contributed about $11.6 million, while more than $8.5 million came directly or indirectly from Michigan taxpayers, including state funding used to provide student stipends. Additional funding was supplied by private philanthropy, including the Gilbert Family Foundation. Academy officials told WIRED that about 71% of graduates from the past two years moved into full-time employment across various industries, a figure broadly in line with many coding boot camps but below outcomes reported by some traditional computer science degree programs. Apple and the university declined to release detailed graduate employment data, despite requirements from one funder that such data be collected. Student experiences have varied. Some graduates credited the academy with exposing them to technology careers and building confidence, while others said the Apple-centric curriculum and limited stipends left them struggling financially and unprepared for the broader job market. One former student told WIRED that many participants relied on food assistance, while another said recent stipend reductions forced students to juggle multiple side jobs. A senior director at Apple who oversees the Detroit program and 17 other Apple Developer Academies worldwide, said increasing student financial support is a continuing priority and that the academy is designed to build broadly applicable skills such as teamwork, research, and technology literacy rather than train students for a single job outcome. The academy takes credit for 62 apps and 13 businesses. He added that the curriculum is frequently adjusted in response to student demand and technological change, noting that workshops were added when students expressed interest in developing apps for the Apple Vision Pro and Apple TV , and that generative AI tools are now incorporated into coursework, provided students can fully explain the code they produce, with alumni also able to access ongoing virtual instruction focused on AI.

The cyberattack may have compromised sensitive production-line information and manufacturing data linked to Apple, and the scope of the breach and its operational impact is unclear. Sources quoted by DigiTimes indicate that the issue has been addressed, but that internal evaluations are ongoing to determine whether there were losses or disruptions tied to the incident. The specific company targeted has not been disclosed. Clients such as Apple typically initiate internal risk assessments to determine the severity of such breaches, the type and volume of data exposed, and whether remediation measures implemented by the supplier are sufficient. Decisions about whether to adjust production orders are said to depend on the outcome of those assessments rather than being automatic responses to an incident due to supply chain complexity. The report added that, in most cases, companies prefer to require suppliers to strengthen cybersecurity infrastructure and tighten internal controls instead of immediately reallocating production.

According to Not a Tesla App , 4.52.0 of Tesla's mobile app contains multiple code references to Harmony Wallet Key Cards. The discovery is notable because it represents a shift in how Tesla appears to be approaching mobile device integration. Tesla's current Phone Key relies on Bluetooth communication between the vehicle and the Tesla app running in the background on a smartphone. By contrast, a native wallet key is stored at the operating system level and uses secure hardware elements, often making it more reliable and accessible. The code strings identified in Tesla app version 4.52.0 specifically reference integration with Huawei's HarmonyOS, suggesting that the initial implementation is designed for Huawei Wallet on HarmonyOS devices. HarmonyOS is widely used in China, where Huawei is a dominant presence in the smartphone market. Tesla has historically used the Chinese market as a testing ground for new software capabilities before expanding them globally. Although the references do not mention Apple Wallet or Google Wallet, the underlying functionality closely mirrors how Apple implements native digital car keys on the iPhone . Apple introduced Car Key support in Apple Wallet in 2020, allowing compatible vehicles to be unlocked, locked, and started using NFC, Bluetooth, or ultra wideband. Car Keys are stored in the Secure Enclave on the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch, enabling features such as Express Mode, which allows a vehicle to be unlocked without Face ID , Touch ID , or a passcode, and even functionality even when the device battery is almost totally depleted. Earlier this month, Rivian announced native support for Apple Wallet and Google Wallet digital car keys as part of its 2025.46 software update. In recent weeks, Porsche , Toyota , and General Motors all appear to be following suit.
