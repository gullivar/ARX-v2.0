We're using multiple data sources and various ways of calculations, to provide this API. Since we're running servers to provide this
                    service, to prevent heavy loads on our servers we apply a limit of 60 requests per minute. However,
                    if you need more, you can subscribe to our paid plan. How to use? The API accepts GET and POST methods and you can pass ip field as body or query param. However, If
                    you don't pass the ip field we'll use the sender's ip address to extract the information. Here you
                    can find some sample codes to use it however, you can read our documentation PHP Curl Python Java JS (Node.js) JS (JQuery) Go Ruby C# Rust <?php
