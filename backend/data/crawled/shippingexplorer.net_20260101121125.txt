Based on AIS, our system builds a map of ship movements in real-time on seas and oceans and allows for locating and detailed monitoring of ships and ports. Map with AIS Data Our application has several map providers and color schemes to show AIS data. Additional layers with information about weather, waves, and wind are available. Route Planning ShippingExplorer offers the tools to plan routes with ETA in ports and bunker calculations. Locate Ships in Real-Time The program allows to search for ships based on a variety of criteria (by name, MMSI, IMO, type, register information, destination, etc.). For example, allowing you to see all passenger ships headed to Lisbon. Alerts We have a flexible configuration system for notifications via SMS and e-mail for tracking ship positions and behavior in real-time. For example, you can be notified when your ship enters a specific area, changed its speed or course. Archive Besides positions of ships on our maps in real-time, ShippingExplorer has archived information about ships for several years.
