Building a thriving and inclusive occupational therapy community

The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) is leading the profession to support a strong and welcoming occupational therapy community by providing resources and tools to strengthen occupational therapy practitioners' contribution to a healthy and engaged community.

Functional cognition in OT

Occupational therapy practitioners analyze how an individual's cognition affects their ability to do the things they want and need to do and collaborate with clients to design individually-tailored interventions using ADLs and (IADLs) that are meaningful to the client and provide direct application of functional skills.

Sleep

Rest and sleep is a foundational occupation in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework, 4th edition. Occupational therapy practitioners can help clients, groups, and communities to manage and develop healthy and effective routines and habits to promote sleep.

Use AOTA’s pain management resources in your everyday practice

Occupational therapy practitioners work with clients who may be or who are experiencing pain. Services are often provided in multi-disciplinary teams, where clients can benefit from the team approach.

I gladly renew my AOTA membership to have an educated voice in advocacy and to be equipped to succeed in the ever-changing health care arena.

Sue Ram
OTD, OTR/L, AOTA member for 5 years

I want to give a big shout-out to the OT practitioners who give hope as part of their treatment. It makes a huge difference.

Susie Touchinsky
OTR/L, SCDCM, CDRS, AOTA member for 7 years

Occupational therapists have the privilege of helping people learn or relearn how to connect with their environment, and we get to have fun while we do it.

Lisa Griggs-Stapleton
Albuquerque, New Mexico

I have already found the profession of occupational therapy to be fascinating, rewarding, and challenging, and filled with countless opportunities to serve one’s community, one’s country, and one’s world.

Brandi Buchanan

I like to think of occupational therapists as puzzle solvers because they assist clients in solving how to complete tasks that they may or may not have been able to do in the past.
