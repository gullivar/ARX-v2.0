	  for research, education, and development in distributed systems and
	  networks. Emulab's primary goals are ease of use, control, and
	  realism, achieved through consistent use of virtualization
	  and abstraction. Emulab is a network testbed, giving researchers a wide range of
      environments in which to develop, debug, and evaluate their systems.
      The name Emulab refers both to a facility and to a software system .
      The primary Emulab installation is run
      by the Flux Group , part of the School of Computing at the University of Utah .
      There are also installations of the Emulab software at more than two
        dozen sites around the world, ranging from testbeds with a handful
      of nodes up to testbeds with hundreds of nodes.
      Emulab is widely used by computer science researchers in the fields of networking and
      distributed systems.
      It is also designed to support education , and has been used to teach
        classes in those fields. Emulab Wiki How to Get Started Acceptable Use Policy Administrative Policies Security Policies Hardware Overview of the Utah cluster What happened to the old Emulab?
