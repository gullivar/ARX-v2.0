Our manifesto
Highest standards for medical science

The Lancet sets extremely high standards. We select only the best research papers for their quality of work and the progression they bring.

Improving lives is the only end goal

Too much research is done for research sake. We believe that improving lives is the only end goal and that research is only relevant when it has an impact on human lives.

Increasing the social impact of science

We recognise that a great research paper is not enough and that it requires development, mobilisation, and exposure. So we promise to set agendas, create context, inform leaders, start debates, and advocate for the idea that research can and will make a difference.
