You’re probably here because you’ve been successful with your website — but not without your share of challenges. The “white screen of death,” a flood of comment spam, tearing your hair out over Block Editor glitches. It’s not just the technology, though. It’s people, too. We’ve heard so many people say to us, “I had a great tech guy, until he stopped responding to my emails.” So I vowed we’ll never be “that guy” and built NerdPress to be there with you, for the long-haul. We even have a “no ghosting” policy in our handbook! 👻 I invite you to learn more about us, what we offer, and how we’re different. Andrew Wilder, Founder & CEO P.S. Isn’t Koko the cutest? Don’t worry, she doesn’t actually have any passwords. Meet some of your new Nerds Try this instead. Imagine a team of helpful, smart, expert, funny (and incredibly good-looking) nerds who care about your website. It would look something like this: Ben responding to security warnings first thing in the morning. Tammy running your updates and reviewing every pixel afterwards. Jamison figuring out a tough layout issue (with lots of screenshots). Sergio auditing your plugins to cut the cruft. Chynna proactively offering to update PHP on your server. Taj confirming that your Google Analytics is still working properly. Heather and Tim fixing the Core Web Vitals issues on your site that nobody else could. … you get the idea. And your new team of nerds is just a click away.

Check out our other support plans → Elise Bauer “Running a website can be a tricky, complicated business. So many things can go wrong, especially on the tech side. When we have a technical issue that we just can’t figure out, we call NerdPress.” Kurt Schmidt “ Yesterday was our busiest day of traffic in our history with 3 million pageviews and a whopping 1.7 million of those coming to a single article. Additionally these last three days is the first time we’ve ever had 3 consecutive days of 1 million plus pageviews back to back to back. This is beyond any traffic levels I’m used to and seeing the website still able to hold up so well is incredibly impressive. “THANK YOU from all of us here at Inside the Magic. We truly appreciate everything you have done.” Michelle Tam “I’m so happy and delighted to be a NerdPress client! As someone who knows little to nothing about the technical side of blogging, I sleep well at night knowing that the super-sharp team is keeping watch over my site and proactively fixing things if anything breaks. They’re also super-responsive whenever I have an issue!” All our WordPress Support Plans include: SEO & User Experience Core Web Vitals Optimization Our expert team uses sophisticated tools and techniques to get your site into the “Good” range on all three metrics for both Mobile and Desktop , with particular attention to your most important pages. After that, if things need adjusting as your site grows, we’ll jump back in as needed, at no extra cost. Take No Chances Nightly Backups Never worry about accidentally deleting a file or getting hacked again! We use two separate backup services (just to be extra safe) and store them for three months. If your website breaks, we can have your site restored in minutes. Beat the Hackers Daily Security Scanning Getting hacked is everyone’s worst nightmare. We’ll audit your site and fix any vulnerabilities, secure it with Cloudflare’s Enterprise-grade firewall — including custom rules tailored to our clients’ sites — and scan your site every day for signs of hacking. If anything comes up, we’ll jump in to fix it right away. Help When You Need It Most Restore and Recovery If your website ever does get hacked or if you accidentally break your site, we can have it restored within minutes. No drama, no panic. Simple as that! Stay Online 24-7 Uptime Monitoring We check your site every 60 seconds, 24 hours a day. If it ever goes down, you’ll know right away. You also get a status page with uptime history and a response time graph, so you can make sure your host is delivering consistently. Your Site's Pulse Site Reports & News Every two weeks, we’ll send a clear, friendly report covering the essentials (traffic, caching, plugin updates, uptime, and more). Plus, we share our perspective on what’s happening in WordPress and beyond through News from the Nerds , so you can stay informed (without getting overwhelmed!). Speed and Security Kari's dog, Melly Enterprise-Grade Security and Performance with Cloudflare All our plans include Cloudflare Enterprise, which is their highest tier of service and support. This includes Cloudflare’s robust firewall and DDoS protection (custom configured for our clients’ specific needs), caching all resources on your domain at their 350+ worldwide datacenters (including proper HTML page caching!), Argo Smart Routing with Smart Tiered Caching to ensure maximum speed and availability , and more. Plus, Cloudflare is never distracted by treats — unlike Melly. Our Top Support Plans add: Human-Managed Updates Keeping your site updated is essential for its health, speed, and security, but it’s also a tricky process which can break things if not handled well. Our team of real humans in the U.S. will update your site regularly and review it carefully afterward. If we find anything amiss, we’ll address it right away — usually before you even realize something happened! 💪 Quick Support Requests Running a site means endless things to fix, tweak, or figure out. That’s exactly what Quick Support Requests are for. Got a question or task that takes 30 minutes or less? We got you. Things like plugin hiccups, style fixes, tracking code problems, and more — no extra charge. (Fun fact: We invented the Quick Support Request over a decade ago, back when everyone else was billing hourly.) Image Optimization Big images can drag your site speed down, but not on our watch! 😎 While all our plans include Cloudflare Polish to optimize images dynamically in the cloud, our higher-tier plans include on-server tools to resize and compress images right at the source. We tailor this setup to your site and preferences, making sure all your images load fast and still looks great. Which plan is right for me? Great question! We’ve got three plans to choose from: Sleep Soundly The Essentials Cover the bases of site speed and security while you’re building your business.

Lee Harrison, Scout Executive & CEO “ We have a dozen websites running on WordPress and the burden of trying to keep on top of everything was becoming too much. We had outsourced some website management in the past and the experience was so-so. Issues tended to be addressed reactively rather than proactively, we had experienced multiple malware infections, and years of different people working on the websites had created some messy builds. “NerdPress was a gamechanger. They assisted in seamlessly migrating our sites to a managed WordPress host, scanned our sites for malicious code, brought everything up to date, implemented new security measures, and created backups. Since moving to NerdPress our sites have never run smoother and we have absolute peace of mind knowing that NerdPress can handle anything we need to keep our websites running fast, clean, and functional. “ Their customer service is THE best in the business. You can expect nothing but fast, friendly, and knowledgeable interactions. Their support team not only resolves the issue, but they will take the time to answer questions, share best practices, and provide guidance to help prevent future problems.” David Lebovitz “NerdPress is trustworthy, responsible, and responsive. They’ve helped me with various aspects of my blog, from hosting issues to providing backups and security. I highly recommend them if you’re looking for someone who will take even better care of your blog than you!” Ben's dog, Kate Winslet Ready for us to help? Then take then next step!
