        The aim of the project is to provide a comprehensive, free reference guide to the gods ( theoi ), spirits
        ( daimones ), fabulous creatures ( theres ) and heroes of ancient Greek mythology and religion. GREEK GODS OLYMPIAN GODS TITANS & TITANESSES NYMPHS & SATYRS MYTHIC BESTIARY GIANTS & GIANT-KIN HEROES & VILLIANS STAR MYTHS ENCYCLOPEDIA A-Z CULT OF THE GODS LEGENDARY CREATURES LEGENDARY TRIBES FAMILY TREES MYTHOLOGY GALLERIES CLASSICAL TEXTS THEOI GREEK MYTHOLOGY The Theoi Project profiles each deity and creature of Greek mythology on a separate page, incorporating an
        encyclopedia summary, quotations from a wide selection of ancient Greek and Roman texts, and illustrations from
        ancient art. Analysis of the texts and interpretation of the stories of myth is currently beyond the scope of
        the project. For such detailed analysis, I would suggest consulting some of the good books available on the
        subject. Transliterated forms of Greek names are used throughout the biography pages of the site rather than their Latin
        forms, e.g. Kirke instead of Circe, Ouranos for Uranus, Apollon in place of Apollo, etc. The index and
        introduction pages, however, use the Latin name-forms for ease of reference. The Theoi Classical Texts Library contains an extensive collection of classical
        literature on the theme of Greek mythology, including the works of many of the lesser known poets which are not
        available online elsewhere. Please note, that these are not the same texts which are quoted on the biography
        pages of Theoi.com, which are listed separately on the Bibliography page. Summaries of the most important of the Greek gods, as well as classes of divinity can be found on the Pantheon and Greek Gods pages. The
        fabulous creatures, tribes and monsters of Greek mythology are listed in the Bestiary . The entire Family Tree of the Greek pantheon of gods is displayed over eight charts
        with a central name index. There is also a separate table outlining the genealogy of the gods from Hesiod's Theogony . A simple map of the various kingdoms of Greek mythology can by found on the Kingdoms page. Other themed pages include Plants and Flowers in Greek mythology and Star Myths . The site contains a Gallery of more than 1200 pictures from ancient Greek and
        Roman art, including vase paintings (C6th to C4th B.C.), sculptures, frescos and mosaics (C4th B.C. to C4th
        A.D.). The Theoi.com pages can be searched using the Google box at the top left-hand corner of this page. Ελληνική
