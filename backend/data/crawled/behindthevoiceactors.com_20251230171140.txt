What is Behind The Voice Actors?
BTVA is a community database of voice over actors and the characters they play across cartoons, anime, TV shows, movies, video games and more. Only it's dialed up to give you a visual and audible experience of seeing images and listening to sound clips of the actors and their character roles, rather than a standard text-based credit list.
