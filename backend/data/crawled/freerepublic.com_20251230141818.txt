What was the impact of AB5 on California’s marginalized communities?
12/30/2025, 2:13:58 PM · by grundle
Pacific Legal Foundation ^ | March 27, 2025 | ALISON SOMIN
Instead of giving these workers additional employment benefits, the result is that they are less likely to be hired at all. The California SAC heard testimony from workers from a diverse array of industries offering their experiences with AB5, including court reporters, translators, cosmetology workers, and exotic dancers. Many of these workers were women, immigrants, people of color, and from other politically disadvantaged groups. Esther Hermida, a representative of the American Alliance of Professional Translators and Interpreters (AAPTI) testified about AB5’s impact on thousands of citizens in her industry comprised of 75 percent women. One professional translator, Ildiko Santana, reported...
Shapiro to become the highest-paid US governor after January pay raise

PennLive ^ | 29 December A.D. 2025 | Benjamin Kail
Pa. Gov. Josh Shapiro will soon become the top-earning governor in the U.S. after an automatic cost-of-living pay bump goes into effect on Jan. 1. Shapiro, a Democrat up for re-election next year who is often named as a 2028 presidential contender, was already the second-highest paid state leader after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. At about $245,000 this year, Shapiro earned about $5,000 less than Hochul, whose salary, according to state law, for the past few years has been $250,000. But along with dozens of other Keystone State officials of both major parties, the new year will bring Shapiro...

The Post Email Newspaper ^ | 29 Dec 2025 | Sharon Rondeau
(Dec. 29, 2025) — New York State resident and registered voter Montgomery Blair Sibley, who challenged the claimed “natural born Citizen” status of former Vice President Kamala Harris, reported Monday on his Substack and website that the U.S. Supreme Court has docketed his petition for a Writ of Certiorari in his long-running “eligibility” case. The action came after Sibley appealed a dismissal from the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court. ... continue reading at: https://www.thepostemail.com/2025/12/29/scotus-dockets-harris-eligibility-case/
Louis Gerstner, the man who saved IBM from Irrelevance, dies at 83 — industry mourns the passing of transformative CEO

Tom's Hardware ^ | 12/29/2025 | Anton Shilov
Louis Gerstner, the executive who engineered one of the most important corporate turnarounds in the history of the high-technology sector, died at the age of 83 on Saturday. Gerstner took control over IBM in 1993 when it was at the brink of breakup and bankruptcy, rebuilt the company into a services-led enterprise, and restored its strategic relevance by 2002. Multiple prominent high-tech leaders worked at IBM under Gertner's leadership, spreading his skills across the industry nowadays. Lou Gerstner IBM's first CEO not from IBM Louis Gerstner was the first IBM chief executive — and so far, the only — to...
Was the Garden of Eden a real place? Here’s what archaeologists think.

National Geographic ^ | 12/29/2025 | Candida Moss
Biblical archaeologists are using ancient texts and modern technology to uncover possible clues to one of Christianity's biggest mysteries.When God banished Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, the Bible says that he placed a cherubim and flaming sword at the entrance that scholars believe is used to guard against their return to this paradise on Earth. But this clear expulsion of human beings hasn’t stopped archaeologists, theologians, and tourists alike from trying to find their way back. The Bible’s vivid geographical description of Eden gave seekers a head start. Readers are initially told that the Eden is “in...
Why Israel's recognition of Somaliland as an independent state is controversial

Israel has taken the controversial decision to recognise the breakaway state of Somaliland as an independent nation, sparking condemnation from many other countries. China is the latest to condemn the decision, with its foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters: "No country should encourage or support other countries' internal separatist forces for its own selfish interests." China outlined its position ahead of the UN Security Council holding an emergency session to discuss Israel's decision. Israel on Friday became the first country in the world to acknowledge Somaliland as a standalone republic, more than 30 years after the region declared independence...

Daycare accused of multimillion-dollar fraud shifts blame for 'revealing' mistake above its front door... as kids are suddenly 'trucked in'

The Daily Mail ^ | 29 December 2025 | BRITTANY CHAIN
A daycare facility allegedly involved in Minnesota's ongoing fraud scandal has hit back at criticism over a misspelled sign as staff reportedly 'truck in' children. The Quality 'Learing' Center in Minneapolis was thrust into the spotlight last week after Nick Shirley shared footage of the facility apparently devoid of children despite receiving millions of dollars in funding. When video emerged of the childcare facility, eagle-eyed critics also noted the sign above the door misspelled the word 'learning.' On Monday, the New York Post observed staff 'trucking in' dozens of children, despite locals admitting they thought the facility had been 'permanently...
What 2025 Revealed About Gaza’s Future

Foreign Policy ^ | 12/29/2025 | Dan Ephron
It’s hard to be optimistic about the future of Gaza. The cease-fire agreement brokered by the Trump administration is holding, but Israel continues to occupy more than half of the territory, and its forces have killed more than 350 Palestinians since the truce was reached on Oct. 10. Hamas, meanwhile, is resurging in Gaza—replacing key commanders killed in the two-year war with Israel; executing its Palestinian opponents; and hiding weapons and fighters in its tunnel system, more than half of which remains intact. So, where does that leave Palestinians and Israelis? And what does it mean for the rest of...

I have a five year old grandson who seems to have very much enjoyed the movie "White Christmas" with Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby a couple of days ago. I would like to put together a list of age appropriate classic movies to recommend for a weekly afternoon movie with grandpa. Keep in mind he is only 5 and as yet not polluted with the "common" culture or exposed to a public school. He lives with a stay at home mom and a working dad and goes to a private school. He and his two younger sisters are much loved...

Hollywood elitist and longtime Democrat activist George Clooney has officially joined the growing list of wealthy, left-wing celebrities who preach “American values” while quietly distancing themselves from the United States.

Chicago's NSFW Response When Jimi Hendrix Invited Them on Tour

Chicago had a loud, and profane, reaction when Jimi Hendrix invited them on tour. It was 1969 and the band, then known as Chicago Transit Authority, was turning heads with a style that infused a dynamic horn section with rock. In a recent appearance on the Broken Record podcast, co-founding members Lee Loughnane and Jimmy Pankow recalled crossing paths with Hendrix. “We were at the Whisky a Go-Go on the Sunset Strip,” Pankow remembered. “We were opening for Albert King. And we were in the dressing room waiting to go back on. There was a knock on the door. And...

Alex Chilton: The Original Big Star Of Indie Music

Alex Chilton was many things: a blue-eyed soul singer, a Big Star power-popper and an indie iconoclast. The one thing he was not? Forgotten.The first time many people heard Alex Chilton’s name was thanks to a Replacements song from 1987, called “Alex Chilton.” The song was warm and proudly fanboyish, imagining Chilton as a star that “children by the millions” were lining up to see at a time when the man himself was drawing hundreds at best. Whenever he was asked about it, the former Big Star icon would reply with an audible shrug: “Yeah, I liked the song....

An Alameda man accused of killing a wild turkey this month is facing felony animal cruelty charges, prosecutors said. The 38-year-old was arrested on Dec. 17 after the illegal hunting was reported to police and animal control by a witness, the East Bay Times reported.

Police told the East Bay Times that the man, who hasn't been publicly named, shot the turkey with a 177 caliber BB gun near the 400...

Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman held a press conference Monday to discuss the murder charges a woman faces in connection with a DUI crash that left a high school tennis prodigy dead earlier this year.
