Hello, I'm Ilya Grigorik.

I am a Distinguished Engineer and Technical Advisor to the CEO at Shopify, on a mission to make commerce better for everyone.

I work at the intersection of technology, product, and platforms. Technology shapes design space for product. Product shapes technical architecture. Carefully engineered interactions and incentives enable thriving platforms.

I was the founder and CTO of PostRank, acquired by Google. I worked on Google Analytics, Chrome, and Search, where I built products and developer programs. I am passionate about improving user experience on the web: author of High Performance Browser Networking (O'Reilly), past co-chair of the W3C Web Performance WG, speaker at 100+ events. Also dad, photographer, and an aspiring cook.
