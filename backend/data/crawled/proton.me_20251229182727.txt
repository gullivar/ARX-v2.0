Fundamentally different

Proton was started in 2014 by scientists who met at CERN and shared a vision of an internet that defends freedom and puts people first.

Our transparency, open-source software, and rigorous encryption have earned Proton millions of users — and the recommendation of the United Nations.

Tech companies like Google or Apple define privacy as “nobody can exploit your data, except for us.” We believe nobody should exploit your data, period.

Our technology and business are based upon this fundamentally stronger definition of privacy, backed also by Swiss privacy laws.

Privacy for a better world

At Proton, we believe that a better world begins with privacy, and this is at the heart of everything we do. Privacy isn’t just something we talk about; it’s a core belief and the reason Proton was created in the first place.

We also believe in people before profits, and our primary shareholder is the nonprofit Proton Foundation, whose mission is to fight for an open internet that promotes freedom of speech and freedom of information.

End-to-end encryption

Our end-to-end encryption and zero-access encryption mean that no one (not even Proton) has the technical means to access your data without your permission.

We don’t sell ads and can’t share your data. At Proton, privacy isn’t a promise, it’s mathematically ensured.

Swiss privacy

Proton is based in Switzerland, and your data does not go to the cloud. Instead, it stays under the protection of some of the world’s strongest privacy laws.

We are a neutral and safe haven for your personal data, committed to defending your freedom.

Proton’s open-source philosophy is also a huge asset to the company. By making their apps transparent and offering bug bounties, they stay ahead of security threats.

What started as Proton Mail, now the world’s largest encrypted email service, has blossomed into an ecosystem of privacy-centric products ... the vanguard of a movement that puts user privacy first.

Because of its transparent, open-source apps and strong commitment to privacy, Proton Unlimited could be a great alternative to Google Suite.
