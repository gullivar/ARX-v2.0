How it works - TrustedForm

Over 40,000 websites have added the SDK to their web form. TrustedForm records the conversion event as it happens and provides proof of consent through a TrustedForm certificate. This can be easily accessed and shared through a web URL which can be retained for up to 5 years. In addition to the certificate being delivered, data insights are provided around the lead event.
