Under CSC Resolution No. 2501292, the Commission emphasized provisions of Joint Administrative Order No. 2023-000 issued with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the Department of Health (DOH), which identifies mental health as among the priority areas for workplace health promotion interventions. This is reinforced by findings from a 2025 Global Workplace Report showing that Filipino workers have the second-highest stress levels in Southeast Asia, driven by unhealthy lifestyles and heavy workloads. These underscore the need for workplace policies that promote both mental and physical well-being. “The Wellness Leave is a proactive response to the realities faced by our workforce today. By giving employees the space to rest, recover, and care for themselves, we reinforce a public service environment that is compassionate, resilient, and more responsive to the needs of the Filipino people,” CSC Chairperson Marilyn Barua-Yap said.
