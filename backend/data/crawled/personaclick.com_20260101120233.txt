Can't find what you're looking for? Check out our full documentation. 1. What exactly does PersonaClick do? PersonaClick is an AI-based Omnichannel Marketing Platform that enables e-commerce brands to create end-to-end personalized customer journeys. Founded in 2017 with Turkey's first Personalized Search technology, we now serve over 150 brands. We provide personalized experiences on web, mobile, and app, and manage omni-channel communications (email, SMS, push notifications, WhatsApp, telegram and store). Our goal is to increase your sales and customer loyalty through data-driven personalization. 2. What is your most distinct competitive advantage? Our biggest differentiator is our "360-degree data collection and processing capability." Unlike many competitors, we can track the behavior of even your anonymous (non-member) users and enable personalization from their first visit. Furthermore, all our products (CDP, recommendation engine, communication automation, etc.) work together in a natively integrated suite, providing a consistent and efficient experience. Our cookieless-ready architecture and SEO-friendly widgets (which are cached by Google) are other critical advantages. 3. What does "anonymous user personalization" mean, and what benefit does it offer me? This means we can show personalized product recommendations or campaigns to a user visiting your site who hasn't even signed up yet, based on their real-time behavior. If this user later becomes a member, their entire anonymous history is merged with their new profile, ensuring no data is lost. This allows you to increase conversion rates and prevent potential customer loss by personalizing from the very top of your sales funnel. 4. How long does the integration process take? The integration process is quite fast, depending on your tech stack and needs. For basic personalization widgets and data collection, a few days can often be sufficient. Our comprehensive documentation and technical support team work alongside you to ensure the process is completed as quickly and smoothly as possible. 5. How does your pricing model work? We offer a fair and transparent model. Pricing is customized based on your transaction volume, active user count, and the specific modules you wish to use (product recommendations, on-site search, multi-channel communication, etc.). This means you only pay for what you need and use. Please Contact Us for a custom quote and demo. 6. We are an enterprise company. Is it scalable and reliable? Absolutely. PersonaClick is built and tested to handle the needs of over 150 high-traffic brands. Our relational database and hybrid algorithms (70% Content-Based, 30% Collaborative Filtering) ensure high performance and accuracy. We also provide dedicated account managers and priority technical support for our enterprise clients. 7. What is the difference between a CDP and a CRM? A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system primarily manages your interactions with known customers (e.g., contact details, support tickets, sales deals). A CDP (Customer Data Platform), like PersonaClick, is designed to create a unified, 360-degree profile of every single user, including anonymous visitors. It collects and unifies data from every touchpoint (web, mobile, app, POS) in real-time. The CDP is the powerful data engine that fuels personalized marketing across all channels, while the CRM is often the system of record for your sales and service teams. PersonaClick acts as your central CDP. 8. What is Segmentation and why is it critical? Segmentation is the process of dividing your customer base into specific groups (segments) based on shared characteristics. PersonaClick enables both: Static Segmentation: Manual groups based on rules (e.g., "Customers in Istanbul"). Dynamic Segmentation: Auto-updating groups based on real-time behavior (e.g., "Users who viewed a product but didn't buy in the last 3 days"). This allows for incredibly precise and effective campaign targeting, ensuring the right message reaches the right person at the right time. 9. What is RFM Analysis? RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a powerful marketing model for identifying your most valuable customers by analyzing three key factors: Recency: How recently did a customer make a purchase? Frequency: How often do they purchase? Monetary: How much money do they spend? PersonaClick automatically calculates RFM scores, allowing you to easily segment and target customers for instance, by creating a "Champions" segment (high RFM) for your loyalty program or an "At Risk" segment (low recency) for win-back campaigns. 10. What is Marketing Automation? Marketing Automation involves using software to automate repetitive marketing tasks and communication workflows. With PersonaClick, you can set up trigger-based automation scenarios that run 24/7. Examples include: Cart Abandonment Series: Sending an email or SMS if a user leaves items in their cart. Price Drop Alerts: Notifying users when a product they viewed goes on sale. Post-Purchase Follow-ups: Requesting an NPS score or a product review after a purchase. This increases operational efficiency and ensures you never miss a chance to engage a customer. 11. How does a Customer Data Platform (CDP) actually work? A Customer Data Platform (CDP) collects behavioral, transactional, and demographic data from every channel and unifies it into a single customer profile. This allows you to understand who each user is, what they do, and how they behave across your website, app, and campaigns. PersonaClick’s real-time CDP turns this unified data into actionable segments instantly without engineering effort. For example, you can automatically identify users who viewed a product multiple times this week and trigger a personalized reminder or incentive. 12. What makes PersonaClick’s CDP different from traditional CDPs? Most CDPs only store and organize customer data. PersonaClick combines an open, real-time CDP with native activation, meaning your segments can be used immediately across email, SMS, push, onsite, and ads. This eliminates the delays and manual work marketers typically face. For example, when a user abandons a cart, PersonaClick can update their profile and trigger a personalized sequence within seconds. 13. How does a CDP help increase conversion and retention? A CDP improves performance by giving you accurate, real-time customer insights that power better targeting and personalization. When users receive messages and experiences that match their behavior, they convert more, return more, and churn less. With PersonaClick, these insights automatically trigger journeys like repeat purchase nudges, personalized recommendations, or category-specific reminders. For example, customers who frequently buy from a premium category can instantly receive higher-value offers or content. 14. Customer Data Platform (CDP) vs. Customer Engagement Platform: What’s the difference? A CDP unifies customer data, while a Customer Engagement Platform uses that data to deliver personalized messages and experiences across channels. PersonaClick combines both in a single platform: it acts as your real-time CDP and your engagement engine. For instance, once the CDP detects a new high-intent segment like users who viewed a product category three times—it can automatically send them personalized emails, push notifications, or onsite recommendations. 15. What is a Customer Engagement Platform, and how does it help my business? A Customer Engagement Platform helps you communicate with customers through personalized, timely, multi-channel experiences across email, SMS, push, and onsite touchpoints. Its goal is to increase conversions, retention, and repeat purchases by delivering the right message at the right moment. PersonaClick’s engagement engine uses real-time data and segmentation to tailor each interaction. For example, if a user prefers mobile browsing, they may receive app push reminders instead of email. 16. How does PersonaClick personalize engagement across channels? PersonaClick analyzes customer behavior—such as views, searches, purchases, and inactivity and translates it into personalized messaging across email, SMS, push, and onsite widgets. Each message adapts to the user’s actions in real time. For example, users who recently browsed running shoes may receive product recommendations in email, a size-based reminder via SMS, and relevant items featured onsite during their next visit. 17. What KPIs improve after using a Customer Engagement Platform? A Customer Engagement Platform typically boosts conversion rate, repeat purchase rate, AOV, and customer lifetime value by delivering more relevant journeys. It also reduces churn by identifying “at-risk” customers earlier. With PersonaClick, brands often see uplift through automated flows such as abandoned cart recovery, re-engagement sequences, and personalized search or recommendations. For example, many retailers see double-digit increases in CRM-driven revenue after automating lifecycle campaigns. 18. What types of marketing automation campaigns deliver the fastest ROI? High-intent, behavior-based automations tend to perform best. These include abandoned cart flows, category revisit reminders, welcome journeys, back-in-stock alerts, and post-purchase follow-ups. PersonaClick offers these automations pre-built and fully customizable. For example, an abandoned cart sequence can start with a push notification, continue with an email, and end with a personalized offer—based on the user’s profile and purchase likelihood. 19. How does marketing automation help lean teams work more efficiently? Marketing automation reduces manual workload by running repetitive tasks automatically such as reminders, onboarding, segmentation, and product-based messaging. This allows small teams to scale their CRM programs without increasing headcount. With PersonaClick, every scenario can be automated visually in minutes. For instance, you can set up a “30-day inactivity” flow once, and it will continuously re-engage users who haven’t visited or purchased. 20. How does onsite marketing personalization increase conversion rates? Onsite marketing personalization adapts banners, recommendations, popups, and content based on each visitor’s behavior, intent, and preferences. Showing users the most relevant products or messages increases click-through rates and reduces drop-offs. PersonaClick’s onsite engine updates in real time. For example, displaying personalized recommendations based on recent browsing or highlighting a category the user has shown interest in. This creates smoother journeys that convert more effectively.
