Кстати, я кажется понял, откуда дипсик берет ответы на вопросы, которые я не могу найти в гугле. Скорее всего, из китайского интернета. Так как иногда он внезапно переходит на китайский. Китайский интернет - это нечто вроде темной материи))) Кстати, это интересная идея. Обычную материю можно сравнить с латинским алфавитом, а темную - с иероглифами. По сути стандартная модель элементарных частиц и представляет собой нечто вроде обычного алфавита. Похоже, что гравитация - это единственное, что объединяет обычную материю с темной. Получается, что гравитация - это нечто вроде звуков, так как алфавиты в разных языках разные, а звуки по большому счету одни и те же. Вероятно так же, что темная материя - это не один вид материи, а много разных, типа как есть много разных языков. И, видимо, каждый тип материи обладает собственными фундаментальными взаимодействиями вместо сильного, слабого и электромагнитного. Видимо, именно поэтому в современной физики удалось объединить эти 3 типа взаимодействий, но не удалось объединить их с гравитацией. то есть гравитон не удастся вписать в стандартную модель, так как частицы - это символы, а гравитоны - звуки. - Звуки есть уникальные для многих языков. - Есть и уникальные, но большая часть - общие. По сути, любой звук сводится к звуковым волнам, тогда как символы - это более сложная модель, тесно связанная с сознанием. P.S. Прошу прощения за формат поста, но сама идея показалась мне достаточно интересной для того, чтобы её высказать.

Sure, architects will tell you to push files to S3 — but real life often means keeping them inside the database. In this post, application optimization lead Alexander Popov breaks down how the standard bytea and pg_largeobject mechanisms work, where their bottlenecks hide, and how Postgres Pro Enterprise helps you get around those limits.

At first it might seem they are two completely different things that have nothing in common, but in fact, psychology plays a huge role in building a user-oriented design. Since any software product is used by humans, and any human mind acts according to the rules and principles of psychology, the latter serves as a great tool for UX designers to create the best user experience for their audience. Here are a few psychology-related hacks that can be applied in UX design: Read more Rating 0 Add to bookmarks 0 Comments 0 Article mefdayy Dec  18  at 16:19 A big guide to Suno: making a song from scratch Reading time 16 min Reach and readers 11K BotHub corporate blog Artificial Intelligence The future is here Sound Tutorial The music world has entered a new era.

Algorithms have seamlessly integrated into our lives—from work to education, creativity, and daily routines. They edit texts, select fonts, generate ideas, assist with coding, compose music, and more. Frankly speaking, the only thing they can’t do yet is brew your coffee. Although... that might just be a matter of time. Just two years ago, we were amazed by neural networks hesitantly manipulating objects in photos. Who could predict back then that Will Smith’s spaghetti feast would mark the beginning of such a revolution? With new opportunities come fresh challenges. How do you navigate this vast landscape? What tools are truly effective? Which ones fit your needs best? Where can you avoid paying, registering, or deciphering complex interfaces? We’ve compiled a list of reliable and user-friendly neural networks ready for immediate use without unnecessary hassles. The services are categorized neatly: text generation, image creation, video production, music composition, presentations, and much more. Each category showcases three top-rated options! Yes, many services offer paid subscriptions. But today, we're focusing solely on what works freely, no credit card required!

But what if the right approach is the opposite: deliberately corrupting data, generating it out of thin air, and creating forgeries indistinguishable from the real thing? Maksim Gramin, systems analyst at Postgres Professional, explains why creating fake data is a critical skill for testing, security, and development — and how to do it properly without turning your database into a junkyard of “John Smith” entries.

When I joined one of our projects, I discovered that several of our test suites took more than an hour to run - painfully slow, to the point where running them for every merge request was simply unrealistic. We wanted fast feedback on each commit, but at that speed, it just wasn’t going to happen. Eventually, through a series of small but precise improvements, I managed to speed things up to 8.5× faster , without rewriting the tests from scratch. In this article, I’ll walk through the bottlenecks we found and how we fixed them.

Every designer or project manager has come across issues like misunderstanding with clients, freezed or unfinished projects, rejected ideas, deadlines violation or even conflict with stakeholders. Obviously, each of these problems might have its own reasons and require separate solutions, but overall, having not enough control over a UX project is a common problem of its own. Let's discuss a few tips that can help organize UX projects more smoothly and retain control over them more effectively.
