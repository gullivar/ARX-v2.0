FAQs

Find answers to commonly asked questions about Team Exercises

What is cybersecurity training?

Cybersecurity training is a structured program designed to educate individuals and teams on best practices for protecting digital assets, detecting threats, and responding to cyber incidents. It covers topics such as phishing awareness, password security, threat detection, and compliance requirements. Immersive provides hands-on, scenario-based training that helps organizations build cyber resilience by equipping employees with real-world skills to defend against evolving threats.


Why is cybersecurity training important?

Cybersecurity training is essential because it helps individuals and organizations defend against evolving cyber threats. Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and human error remains one of the biggest vulnerabilities. By providing structured training, businesses can reduce risks, improve security posture, and ensure compliance with industry regulations. Well-trained employees can recognize phishing attempts, use strong passwords, and respond effectively to security incidents, ultimately protecting sensitive data and business operations.


Why is cybersecurity awareness training important?

Cybersecurity awareness training empowers employees to recognize and respond to potential threats before they become security incidents. Many cyber attacks exploit human error, such as clicking on malicious links or using weak passwords. Awareness training helps build a security-conscious culture where employees understand the importance of protecting company and customer data. It also supports regulatory compliance and reduces the risk of financial and reputational damage caused by data breaches.


How to measure the effectiveness of cybersecurity training?

The effectiveness of cybersecurity training can be measured using various metrics, including knowledge assessments, phishing simulation results, and behavioral changes over time. Immersive offers a unique Resilience Score, which quantifies an organization's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats. This score provides a data-driven approach to evaluating cybersecurity preparedness, allowing businesses to identify gaps and continuously improve their security training programs.
