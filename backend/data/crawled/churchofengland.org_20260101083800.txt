The Grumpy Owl and the Joy of Christmas

Something wonderful is about to happen. The Saviour of the world is about to be born. But the grumpy owl who lives in the barn just wants to be left alone... Will the animals help our owl to discover the Joy of Christmas?

Develop a daily connection with God

Everyday Faith is the new daily devotional app from the Church of England designed to inspire, equip and encourage you in your faith every day of the week, not just on Sundays.

The app will provide you with carefully curated daily reflections, including selected Bible readings, a simple prayer to prepare you for the day ahead, and thoughts based on that week’s theme.

Prayer for the Day
Wednesday, 31 December 2025

Almighty God,
who wonderfully created us in your own image
and yet more wonderfully restored us
through your Son Jesus Christ:
grant that, as he came to share in our humanity,
so we may share the life of his divinity;
who is alive and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
Amen.

The First Sunday of Christmas
