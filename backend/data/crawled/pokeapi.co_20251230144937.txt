What is this?

This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

We've covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.

Where do I start?

We have awesome documentation on how to use this API. It takes minutes to get started.

This API will always be publicly available and will never require any extensive setup process to consume.
