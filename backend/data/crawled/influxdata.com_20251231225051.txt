High-performance at scale Manage millions of time series data points per second without limits or caps. Run where you need it Run at any scale in any environment: in the cloud, on-prem, or at the edge. Build with the tools you love Easily connect to your tech stack using data standards and 5K+ easy integrations. InfluxDB is the engine behind the real-time data pipeline. Real-time AI requires massive streams of time series. This allows data to flow continuously through ingest, analysis, compression, and integration—fueling smarter, more autonomous systems. See ways to get started High-Speed Ingest Ingest millions of series without impacting performance. Real-Time Analytics Transform and analyze unlimited series in real-time. Eviction and Lakehouse Integration Automatically evicts cold data and streams it into lakes, warehouses, and AI/ML pipelines. Compression and Downsampling Best-in-class compression. Parquet files store more data with less space. Purpose-built for the world's most demanding systems From grid stability to satellite telemetry, InfluxDB powers the systems that can't afford to lag. Aerospace Aerospace telemetry never stops. Stay ahead with a database built for speed, precision, and decades of data. Learn More Energy & Utilities Power modern energy systems with real-time insights that maximize efficiency and reduce downtime. Learn More Modern Data Historian Upgrade your historian for Industry 4.0 with real-time data that drives efficiency and lowers costs. Learn More Physical AI runs on time series Predict the future based on the past. InfluxDB captures high-resolution time series data with the precision and context AI models need to infer cause and effect, enabling real-time systems to detect, respond, and predict intelligently. Learn More Anomaly Detection Find failure fast—detect anomalies in real-time, trigger automated responses, and adapt as conditions change. Predictive Maintenance Prevent downtime before it hits. Monitor equipment health and usage patterns to predict issues and resolve them before they start. Autonomous Optimization Build self-correcting systems. Enable models to self-learn and adapt through continuous retraining—automatically. Build systems and infrastructure monitoring that scales Keep pace with the flood of time series data. Learn how to build real-time monitoring that scales securely with InfluxDB and Grafana to keep ahead of outages, performance regressions, and costly blind spots.
