Road to Lord of Hatred

Sanctuary has weathered horrors, but none without cost. Lilith’s return shattered fragile alliances and left the world scarred; her fall only deepened the fractures running through the lands. In the wilds of Nahantu, new truths surfaced—whispers of a deeper, older malice stirring beyond the veil.

As the faithful, the desperate, and the corrupted clash, one presence threads through every tragedy: Mephisto. His influence coils through the world, guiding events toward Skovos and the coming reckoning. The story of Diablo IV has been building to this climactic moment.
