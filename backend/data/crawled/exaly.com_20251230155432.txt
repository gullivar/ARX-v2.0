What is exaly?

This is a non-profit endeavour to address the absence of a comprehensive, unbiased, and independent bibliographic database.

The project is absolutely independent with no link with publishers, research institutions, funding agencies, etc. whatsoever.

The project is funded by individuals, and no public/corporate fund has been used.
How does it work?

The entire system has been designed and developed from scratch, including all programmes, scripts, system architecture, and natural language processing (NLP) tools, and no third-party data resources were used.

All the scientometric indices, such as impact factor, h-index, etc., are calculated by counting the citations captured by the system, and authors, institutions, etc., were detected by the native NLP tools.
