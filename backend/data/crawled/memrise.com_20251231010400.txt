Speak a new language with real-world confidence.
Order that coffee, laugh at the joke, and feel at home from your very first session.

Memrise teaches you the language people actually use. Don't just say the words – sound like you belong. 

 

NEW! If your course doesn’t have the vocab you need, someone else already made it.

Memrise now has a growing community of learners building wordlists for every goal imaginable.

Speak a new language the Memrise way

Three steps. One goal: real-world confidence.

Lock in the right words

Learn what you’ll actually use. Smart spaced repetition makes key vocab and phrases stick, so you’re ready when it counts.

Tune in to real voices

Bite-size videos from native speakers train your ear for accent, tone, and nuance.  You won't just learn the words, you feel how they’re said.

Speak out with confidence

Practice in private with your AI coach until everything clicks. No pressure, no judgment. Just natural, fluent conversation on your terms.

How It Works

Here's a little timeline of what your learning experience could look like.

Day 2
Start saying your first phrases out loud

Practice your lines with your private AI coach. Stumble, fix, nail it. Confidence grows fast when no one’s watching (except the algorithm).
Week 1
Feel ready to give it a go in the world

That first smooth coffee order. That grin when someone replies back.
You’re not “practicing” anymore. You’re communicating.

Minute 10
See and hear how locals say them
 
Short, sharp video clips tune your brain to real accent, pace, and feeling.
You’re not learning a word – you’re learning how it lives.
