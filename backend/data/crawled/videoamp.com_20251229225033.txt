Client Testimonials

“When I think about Paramount’s relationship with VideoAmp, this is one of the tightest relationships we have in the space…We see our partnership continuing to grow, continuing to accelerate.”

Travis Scoles | Paramount
Read testimonial

"VideoAmp's biggest strength is their speed to innovation. Their ability to really commingle both ACR and set top box, which is no easy feat."

Brad Stockton | Dentsu
Read testimonial

"Looking ahead, we definitely see VideoAmp as a instrumental partner as we look to transact more on advanced audiences. VideoAmp is actually our first measurement partner to establish data interoperability through the NBCU data clean room. So with that, we have enabled advertiser initiated buy side measurement, ranging from cross platform reach and frequency all the way to outcome based attribution."

Maggie Zhang | NBCUniversal
Read testimonial

"Over half of our data driven linear business today is executed on VideoAmp, and that leads to fundamentally a higher density of delivery against the segments that our agencies and advertisers care about most, functionally increasing the value of our inventory while decreasing the CPMs and making it much easier for agencies and advertisers to reach those hard to find segments."

Dan Aversano | TelevisaUnivision
Read testimonial

"What excites me about what VideoAmp is doing is the opportunity to change the status quo and do something different in the marketplace and make how we measure what we're doing better, not just in counting impressions, but also, business outcomes at the end of the day."

Dave Campanelli | Horizon
Read testimonial

"In the past year, we've moved from zero percent of our advertisers leveraging big data to almost a hundred percent of our advertisers are now using advanced audiences across the entirety of our portfolio. Almost all of our advertisers are leveraging VideoAmp for that. VideoAmp is a future forward company, and it's really allowing Warner Brothers Discovery to accelerate our advanced advertising roadmap."

Steve Silvestri | Warner Bros Discovery
Read testimonial

"VideoAmp had the data infrastructure to be able to support advanced audiences, to be able to support cross platform measurement in ways that legacy panel methodologies could not. Our co-development relationship means that we can inform VideoAmp of our business needs in real time and this is incredibly important because we need to keep pace with this ever changing industry of ours."
