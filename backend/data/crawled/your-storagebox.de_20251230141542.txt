FEATURES
FLEXIBLE ACCESS

You can use various access protocols such as FTP, SFTP, SCP, and RSYNC so that you can easily and securely access your Storage Box. You can even integrate your Storage Box into your own file system via Webdav or Samba.

HIGH RELIABILITY

Use the Snapshots feature to take a snapshot of your Storage Box and restore it if necessary. This increases the reliability of your data. You can either create snapshots manually or have them generated automatically based on your own personal configurations.

FLEXIBLE STORAGE

Be flexible with your Storage Box. You can scale it up or down to fit your current needs, and without losing data or having to migrate it manually. Just go to your Storage Box via Hetzner Console and change to the Storage Box capacity which fits better.
