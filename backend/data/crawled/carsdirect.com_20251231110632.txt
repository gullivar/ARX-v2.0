2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6
The 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 is arriving with a refresh for the upcoming model year, along with a performance N version. Hyundai showed off the 2026 IONIQ 6 at this year's Seoul Mobility Show, giving us a preview of what&rsquo;s in store for the electric sedan. Meanwhile, the IONIQ 6 N debuted in July 2025 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, in West Sussex, England. However, new reports claim that Hyundai might drop the IONIQ 6 lineup in the U.S. Here&rsquo;s what we know about the upcoming 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6.Hyundai revealed the refreshed 2026 IONIQ 6 for some markets at the 2025 Seoul Mobility Show. The front end of the sedan sees the largest change with updated headlights, razor-thin daytime running lights, a more squared-off front fascia, and a more prominent front bumper. At the back, the 2026 IONIQ 6 ditches its rear spoiler at the base of the rear windshield and adopts a larger ducktail spoiler at the base of the lift gate. The rear bumper appears to have a simpler design, while the taillights have a new lighting element.However, it&rsquo;s unclear if the automaker will bring the redesigned IONIQ 6 lineup to the U.S. A Hyundai spokesperson told The Korean Car Blog that the company doesn&rsquo;t have plans to launch the updated sedan in the U.S., and reconfirmed its plans to debut the 2026 IONIQ 6 N in the market.The IONIQ 6 N echoes the same fierce sporty nature found in the IONIQ 5 N. With a squared-off front fascia, the IONIQ 6 N mirrors the look of the IONIQ 6, but larger air intakes give away its performance underpinnings. At the back, the 6 N has dual spoilers to help with performance and give it a different look than the updated IONIQ 6. The IONIQ 6 N comes not only in several signature colors but also adds another paint option as well, Performance Blue Pearl, which brings in a pearl top coat to give depth and shine to the already striking Performance Blue color found on the IONIQ 5 N.The interior design of the 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 will mostly remain the same for the upcoming model year. The electric sedan&rsquo;s steering wheel has been updated, while the IONIQ 6 also benefits from larger controls for the HVAC system and a reorganized center console. Hyundai claims that it has also fitted the IONIQ 6 with more premium materials.The IONIQ 6 N has a clean, bold interior that looks similar to the IONIQ 6. It has a large screen that dominates the dash and incorporates both the driver's instrument panel and the infotainment system.Hyundai hasn&rsquo;t confirmed all of the IONIQ 6&rsquo;s tech features for 2026, but the electric sedan is expected to come with similar features as the current model that&rsquo;s on sale. The current IONIQ 6 comes with a 12.3-inch touchscreen, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth, five USB ports, navigation, satellite radio, and six audio speakers.2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 Engine &amp; SpecsInformation on what kind of powertrains the 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 will come with isn&rsquo;t available yet. We could see Hyundai make some slight changes to increase power and range. The current IONIQ 6 comes with a single electric motor that makes 149 horsepower and rear-wheel drive. Higher IONIQ 6 trims with RWD are rated at 225 hp. Dual electric motors bring all-wheel drive and 320 hp.Range depends on trim and configuration. The base 53-kWh battery and RWD bring up to 240 miles of range. Trims with the larger 77.4-kWh battery and RWD can travel up to 361 miles. With AWD, the IONIQ 6 is rated at up to 316 miles.Hyundai also teased the upcoming IONIQ 6 N. The trim is expected to have 641 hp from dual electric motors and make 568 lb-ft of torque. Equipped with a wider stance, flared fenders, lightweight wheels, and a large wing spoiler, we expect it to focus on high-speed stability and performance, especially for an EV. The IONIQ 6 N has a fully reengineered chassis and redesigned suspension geometry developed for better handling performance and road holding. According to Hyundai, this enhances track performance and gives ride comfort on daily drives.2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 SafetyStandard safety features for the 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 are expected to mirror ones found on the current EV. The IONIQ 6 should come standard with forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian and cyclist detection, a driver attention monitor, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam assist, front and rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise control, rear cross-traffic alert, and Hyundai&rsquo;s Highway Driving Assist I system.2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 PriceWe don&rsquo;t know how much the 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 will cost. The refresh could see pricing for the 2026 model year increase compared to the current EV that&rsquo;s on sale. The current IONIQ 6 ranges from $39,045 to $52,295. Pricing for the IONIQ 6 N hasn't been announced, but we expect the performance variant to start at a higher price than the IONIQ 6 sedan.Competitors should include the Tesla Model 3, Polestar 2, and BMW i4.2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 Release DateHyundai hasn&rsquo;t confirmed when the 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 6 and IONIQ 6 N will go on sale, and we may not see the 2026 IONIQ 6 in the U.S. Hyundai&rsquo;s U.S. website doesn&rsquo;t have a listing for the 2026 IONIQ 6, and its full page for the IONIQ N claims the car is &ldquo;Coming Spring 2026,&rdquo; according to Electrek. More updates on the EV should become available within the next few months.Please check back for updates.Source: Hyundai, The Korean Car Blog, Electrek
