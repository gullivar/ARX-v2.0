* Some websites or apps claim to have over 3,693,575 podcasts in their database. However, they often inflate these numbers by including: 1) Podcasts that were deleted long ago. 2) Very low-quality content, such as feeds with no episodes, just a short test clip, or AI-generated audio. 3) Non-audio content, like RSS feeds containing only PDFs. In contrast, we use 24/7 automated scripts and human moderators to ensure our database includes genuine, human-crafted podcasts, not AI-generated junk.
