Guidelines on Assessment Data Usage No comparison of test scores across school years. Test items can vary in difficulty from year to year, making it inaccurate to compare scores across different school years. Additionally, the schools and learners selected to take the tests may differ each year, which affects the modality of test administration, whether census or sampling. Consequently, differences in math or numeracy scores between 2017 and 2024 may not indicate an actual improvement in learning outcomes at the school. Instead, focus on the latest available mean percentage scores and proficiency levels for your school, division, or local government unit (LGU) to start understanding the factors influencing these scores. No Ranking of schools. Schools operate within different contexts that can explain variations in learning outcomes. Factors contributing to these differences may include income, size and location of the school, learner-teacher or classroom-teacher ratios, access to resources and funding, teaching and learning delivery methods, and the size of the student population. Rather than ranking schools, compare test scores to different benchmarks: the national average, regional average, or division average mean percentage scores (MPS) in certain subjects, or proficiency levels.
