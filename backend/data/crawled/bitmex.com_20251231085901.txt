Cryptocurrency derivatives are tradeable financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying crypto asset (e.g. Bitcoin ). They allow traders to gain exposure to an asset’s price movement without having to own the asset itself. Just like traditional financial markets, cryptocurrency derivatives require two parties to enter a contract that specifies the conditions for purchasing or selling the underlying asset including the contract’s validity period, price, and quantity.
