The new year always makes me want a fresh start, especially in the kitchen.

I plan the meals and even create the shopping list for you! Less stress, fewer store runs, and more time for the fun stuff. CLICK HERE for My Free Meal Plans What’s for Dinner? I’ve Got a Plan!

Recipes for Any Budget Weekly Meal Plans Weekly Meal Plan #69 View More Meal Plans Recipe Skill Levels Every recipe is tagged with a skill level. It’s a quick way to know what you’re getting into before you even read the ingredients list. Easy What it means: Simple, stress-free, and reliable. Ingredients: 8–10 or fewer, mostly pantry staples. Techniques: Basic skills (sauté, boil, bake, stir). No special equipment beyond a skillet, sheet pan, or slow cooker. Time: 30 minutes or less active cooking, or “dump and go” like a crockpot or air fryer. Intermediate What it means: Something you can tackle when you have a little extra time. Ingredients: 10–15, may include a special seasoning or sauce (like hoisin or fish sauce). Techniques: Multi-step cooking (like searing then baking, thickening sauces, kneading dough). Might require a food processor, stand mixer, or thermometer. Time: 45–90 minutes. Advanced What it means: A more time consuming recipe for people who love the process as much as the result. Ingredients: 15+, often specialty items or fresh herbs. Techniques: advanced methods like roux, laminated dough, tempering eggs. Often requires timing awareness and multiple pots/pans going at once. Time: 2+ hours, sometimes overnight. YOUR Favorite Recipes on the Site!
