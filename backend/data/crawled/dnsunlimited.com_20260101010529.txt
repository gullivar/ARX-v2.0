Secondary DNS provides name server redundancy without having to manage your own network of DNS servers.  This service is ideal for hosting providers and small businesses alike who run their own DNS servers but require additional redundancy.  Having multiple name servers is critical to your presense on the Internet.  With multiple servers your domain will continue to function in the event of a primary server outage. DNS Unlimited's secondary DNS service is compatible with all major DNS servers including BIND, Microsoft Windows Server, NSD, PowerDNS, Simple DNS Plus, and many others.  Users of shared hosting providers that allow zone transfers are also supported. Services FAQ DNS Tools Support Contact Us
