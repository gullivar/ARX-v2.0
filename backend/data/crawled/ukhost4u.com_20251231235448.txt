I’ve been with ukhost4u for many years… Just a big shout to John Terramoto who in the space of two days has constantly supplied me with good support and answers to a number of issues that were occurring on four of my customers’ domains. It’s been pretty full on and Jon did his utmost best in his support and even assisted in my cPanel on files that I did not understand how to create. I’ve been with ukhost4u for many years and both John and Will have been and are an incredible support – thank you guys. — Andrew Bailey What a fantastic hosting company.
