Hit the Ground Helping

Through Project BUILD, Duke students jump into service as soon as they arrive on campus — volunteering across Durham while forging bonds and discovering their new community together. 

BUILD CONNECTIONS

COMMUNITY ENTERPRISE

Strengthening N.C. Nonprofits

Duke Law students helped turn an abandoned Durham school into the Lyon Park Center — a neighborhood hub with a gym, track, computer lab, community garden, playground, music program, offices and more. It was built through a relationship between Duke Law’s Community Enterprise Clinic and the West End Community Foundation.

NORTH CAROLINA RESEARCH CAMPUS

Aerial views of the North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis, North Carolina. There is a clip of a water tower with the town’s name on it, two clips of buildings, people measuring liquids in a lab and a nurse taking a patient’s blood pressure.

Research at universities is seen as an abstract thing that doesn’t impact people’s daily lives. But the fact is … the things that we’re doing are designed specifically to improve the health and lives of the general public.
