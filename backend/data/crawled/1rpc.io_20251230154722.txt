“Incorporate TEE-based RPC privacy into existing wallets as a short-term mitigation. Automata has a version of this already...this allows users to interact with RPC nodes while getting stronger assurances that their private data is not being collected.”

1RPC lets AI work for you, not against you
Put privacy on autopilot with the one relay that secures your connection with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
Web3 relay
AI is only getting better
Modern AI systems are improving every day. Surveillance at scale is no longer gated by cost, access, or institutional power.
Web3 relay
Metadata leaks are not
Metadata leaks persist before the transaction is ever published onchain. Signals are often observed by infrastructure providers.
Web3 relay
Inference is instant and always-on
AI can correlate leaked metadata with mechanical accuracy. For example, wallets can be clustered based on timing and intent.
Web3 relay
Verify every Web3 connection
1RPC runs all relayer logic inside a TEE so a user's private metadata is never logged or leaked to the host or RPC provider.
AI Subagents
AI agents are only getting easier
AI agents are becoming easier to create, deploy, and automate. What once required teams now takes a prompt.
AI Subagents
Agent verifiability is not
Most AI agents run without audits or proof of behaviour. Agentic actions and outputs cannot be cryptographically verified.
AI Subagents
A nation of rogue AI agents
Without verifiable execution, users cannot prove the honesty of their digital serfs. This risk compounds with high-stakes decisions.
AI Subagents
Authenticate every agentic action
1RPC AI Subagents enforce execution within a TEE module so user requests are handled exactly as intended, and verifiably so.

What is 1RPC?

1RPC.io is a TEE-attested relay to protect user privacy and verify AI agents. It ensures zero-tracking by eradicating machine-level metadata from user requests across 64+ networks. Through AI Subagents, the relay also enforces verifiable execution to keep agents honest.
