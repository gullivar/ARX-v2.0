Explore research areas play silent looping video pause silent looping video unmute video mute video One research paper started it all The research we do today becomes the Google of the future. Google itself began with a research paper, published in 1998, and was the foundation of Google Search. Our ongoing research over the past 25 years has transformed not only the company, but how people are able to interact with the world and its information. See the original publication Responsible research is at the heart of what we do The impact we create from our research has the potential to reach billions of people. That's why everything we do is guided by methodology that is grounded in responsible practices and thorough consideration.
