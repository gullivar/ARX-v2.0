What's New in jQuery UI 1.14?

Compatibility with recent jQuery versions (up to 3.7): Usage of deprecated jQuery APIs have been removed. jQuery UI 1.14.1 triggers no jQuery Migrate warnings when running its test suite against jQuery 3.7.1 with jQuery Migrate 3.5.2, i.e. the latest versions at the moment of its release. Support for very old jQuery versions has been dropped, except for the latest releases in each major jQuery line. See the changelog of a specific jQuery UI version to see which jQuery versions have been tested with it.

Dropped support: IE & Edge Legacy: Only the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Edge are officially supported.
