Some companies we've
had the pleasure of working with



"Pushy Enterprise has proven to be a reliable, easy-to-integrate solution for delivering push notifications to our customers in mainland China. We currently use it side-by-side with other push notification services for the rest of the world, and so far it lived up to our standards regarding performance and stability."

TIM PREUSS
Software Architect at 



"Our experience with Pushy in the past five years has been good.
The service is reliable and fills the gap we have with GCM / FCM not working in China."

BRENT DERMOTT
Director of IT Engineering at  Motorola



"We've been using Pushy for the past three years for in-store click-and-collect order fulfillment. Integration was easy, and Pushy has consistently achieved 99% to 100% notification delivery rates, month by month."

DARREN MADDOCK
Lead Developer at 

"As the pioneer of a super app model, Gojek is designed to create value for everyone in our ecosystem: our consumers, driver partners, merchant partners and business partners. For our merchants, we want to be the growth partner by providing end-to-end business and operational solutions, and Pushy has been a reliable tool to support us delivering this goal."

RIKY WIJAYA
Engineer at 

"Our solution requires immediate delivery of time-critical alerts in response to printing device failure. After switching from FCM to Pushy, we have witnessed an increase in immediate notification delivery rates, ensuring our clients are aware of any uptime issues with our devices in real time, as they occur, and not minutes or hours later."

TAMIR OLPAK
R&D Manager at  Kodak

"Integration with Pushy was easy, affordable, and the service highly reliable and fast for delivering push notifications to our in-store personnel, in real-time, to speed up order processing. Implementing Pushy Enterprise in our retail solutions has helped us meet our customer SLAs."

CHRIS DAVID
Project Manager at  Chemist Warehouse

"We implemented Pushy for its lightning-fast notification delivery, as we need to send notifications to partner hotel staff in real time, providing guests the best possible stay from a service and facilities perspective."
