[*] For deliveries within the EU, all prices include VAT plus shipping costs. For deliveries to countries outside the EU, prices may exclude VAT, plus shipping costs and may also incur additional import charges. Please refer to the price information on the specific product page.

[**] The stated delivery time includes the complete processing of the shipment at BIKE24 and transport to the delivery address you provided. For items not in stock, it also covers the time needed to procure the goods from our suppliers. The stated delivery time refers to the currently selected delivery country South Korea. Change delivery country
The DHL Express option is generally subject to a surcharge. DHL Express can be selected during checkout if all items in the shopping cart offer the Express option and DHL Express is available for the selected country. We display the remaining time for receiving the order in exact hours and minutes. For DHL Express deliveries, parcel transit times may be longer depending on the postal code of the delivery address. Once the postal code is entered, the exact parcel transit time for that address will be calculated. If you are logged in to your account, we will use the postal code of your default delivery address to calculate the DHL Express transit time. Change delivery country
If you order multiple items with different delivery times, shipping will begin once all items are ready for dispatch. For the payment method “cash in advance,” delivery time will be extended, as shipping will not start until payment is actually received. The status “Not deliverable” indicates items that are currently unavailable and for which there is no reliable availability information. These items cannot be ordered. We recommend choosing other available products from the BIKE24 range. More about delivery.

[5] Savings compared to the recommended retail price of the manufacturer or German importer.

[8] The shipping promise is only valid for delivery to Germany. This includes all items with the shipping promise symbol. For more information on the delivery time, please see the detailed view of the respective product. More about the shipping promise.

[9] Only available in Germany – Available for orders from €499. 5.9% annual percentage rate (APR) with a term of 6 to 60 months. Financing is provided by our partner, TARGOBANK AG & Co. KGaA, Kasernenstraße 10, 40213 Düsseldorf, Germany. Subject to credit approval. No fees.

[10] Only available in Germany – The stated “leasing price” is a guideline for 36 months of use and is calculated from the purchase price minus any potential income tax benefits from a salary conversion. The calculation assumes the maximum possible income tax benefit. Your actual savings depend on your income and personal circumstances and may be lower. Transfer costs at the end of the lease are not included. You can calculate your individual lease rate using the calculators provided by our leasing partners on our leasing information page. Please note that for discounted items under leasing, we apply a 5% surcharge to the purchase price shown in the webshop – but never more than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP).
