I went from having no running experience to being able to run my first 5k! All with the guidance and joy from Tommy Rivs and John Peel. I absolutely adore you guys!

SS

Love iFIT. Just completed my 100th workout. Enjoying every minute. Keeps you accountable. Trainers are enthusiastic and love getting to know them! Highly recommend.

Jen

I have done at least one program a day for the last few years. Mixing HIIT, yoga, weight training and stretching. Muscle tone and strength is better than it has been in 20 years.

DW

I just renewed for another year because iFIT really has made working out easy, at home or at the gym. I love how motivating the trainers are. Best decision I ever made.

TD

After completing 2 marathons, this year I am training for my first ultra marathon!! If it was not for iFIT I would have never thought I could.

MK

I am someone who gets intimidated easily by working out. Every workout I’ve completed so far has been nothing but a kind, compassionate space for learning and growing.

Lucy

iFIT's new AI personal trainer has shaken up my typical workout routine and I love the challenge. I'm trying out new workouts instead of relying on my old faves.

RK

I have been using iFIT for 4 years now. To say iFIT changed my life is an understatement.

PS

The trainers, types of workouts, length of workouts are all so diverse and interesting. There is literally something for everyone. It will change your life!!!

JMS

The coaches feel like personal friends. I have never before looked forward to workouts until iFIT. My progress is amazing.

MT

My fitness level has changed drastically with iFIT workouts. I am stronger and more confident.
