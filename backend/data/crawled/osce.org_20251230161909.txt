Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe

With 57 States from Europe, Central Asia and America, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is the world’s largest regional security organization.

About us
Our mission

We work for stability, peace and democracy through an engaged political dialogue, shared values and joint action.
 

Shared values and joint action

The OSCE is a regional security organization whose 57 participating States span the geographical area from Vancouver to Vladivostok. All participating States have equal status and decisions are made by consensus. One of our Organization’s most distinct characteristics is its comprehensive and co-operative approach to security.
