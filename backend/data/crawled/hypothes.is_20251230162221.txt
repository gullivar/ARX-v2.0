Where Learning Begins

How Hypothesis Transforms Teaching & Learning:
Human Centered Learning
Stronger Student Outcomes
Workforce-Ready Skills
Human Centered Learning in the Age of AI

Students are turning to AI to shortcut the reading and thinking that higher education depends on. Hypothesis restores what matters: real engagement with course materials, deeper critical reading, and authentic dialogue between students and instructors. Instead of policing AI, faculty can create learning environments where students actually read, think, and contribute.

Testimonials
Professor of Chemistry
Rutgers University–Camden
Dr. Georgia Arbuckle-Keil
"I noticed that the personality of the students came through...I gain insight into the students beyond what is possible in the classroom. Even after we are back in person, I have enjoyed getting to know students via Hypothesis beyond a typical classroom response."
Distinguished Professor
Information Science and Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder
Leysia Palen
"With Hypothesis, everyone’s visible to each other and so we really do have a chance at creating a learning community. Students get to know each other’s names. Conversations with Hypothesis feel very warm and collegial. Nobody has to be afraid of raising their hand"
Assistant Professor
Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies, Metropolitan State University of Denver
Dr. Sonny Dhoot
"Hypothesis allows us to push the limits of what we think is required as a solitary activity. Every time I ask my students to annotate, it has a very clear purpose and will directly benefit the students. The annotations are almost like a ‘living’ text that they are able to go back to. With Hypothesis, students are actually reading together, and they are giving each other feedback. I would never have thought that you could do that."
Associate Professor of Teaching/Instruction
Temple University
Marcia Bailey
"Hypothesis is an excellent tool to engage students with the text and with each other. I used it almost weekly this semester."
Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology
Knox College
Nancy Eberhardt, Ph.D.
"Hypothesis gets students talking to each other about the reading outside of the classroom in a way that I have never been able to see happen before. They come to class much more ready to talk about the reading, and I have a sneak preview of the issues they found most compelling, as well as the ones they might have missed"
Professor of English
Florida State University
Candace Ward, Ph.D.
"I’ve found Hypothesis invaluable in engaging students with assigned reading material…The students say very smart things; they engage with each other very civilly and respectfully, and they synthesize their annotations with other class discussions, projects, and readings."
ESOL Instructor
Peralta Community College District
Danitza Lopez
"We love Hypothesis! This handy tool allows us to go deeper than any other platform because we can directly have discussions about a particular word/sentence/paragraph within a text. We even use it for peer reviews, and it works super well. It is such an easy tool to use, too!"
Professor of English
Cerritos College
Francie Quaas-Berryman
"I have found Hypothesis to be a great way to guide students through online reading, provide additional resources directly through the text, and engage them in online discussions of the text!"
