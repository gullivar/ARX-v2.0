Why Additive Manufacturing?
Reduce Assembly Time

Don’t waste time putting products together! Rely on 3D printing to make complex geometries that can be printed as one piece—or consolidated in one build.

Fast Turnaround​

Working on a project for a customer that has to be just right? Get models back fast, and 3D print new iterations, if needed, for final feedback and production.

Reliable Quality

Proprietary processes, expert 3D printing operators, and inspections are our secrets to delivering exceptional, quality products every time.​

Nylon 12 [PA12 (SLS)]

Nylon 12 [PA12 (SLS)] is a durable nylon plastic that can be used for a wide range of applications, both for prototyping and for end products. Printed using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printing services, when thin, it's flexible enough for hinges and springs and when thick, strong enough for structural components.
Material Details 

Accura 60

Accura 60 is a translucent and rigid acrylate-based plastic. Shapeways 3D prints this material using a large-format Stereolithography (SLA) printer capable of producing small to large parts with high resolution and detail as well as smooth surfaces with limited layer lines.
Material Details 

Stainless Steel 316L

Stainless Steel 316L is manufactured using ExOne’s ‘Triple Advanced Compaction Technology’ with Binder Jetting. Unlike our Steel that is infused with bronze, this material is a single alloy, composed of pure Stainless Steel.

Testimonials

I like the ease of use in the Shapeways platform, being able to 3D print on-demand orders for the first time, and most of all–being able to scale my business. In the beginning years ago I basically had the change in my pocket and a credit line at my bank so I couldn’t order a ton of things, and you never know what’s going to sell.”

STEVEN JAWORSKI
OWNER | VOYTEK MEDICAL

During the process, we used Shapeways capabilities to 3D print many prototypes. That meant we had the option to iterate very quickly, print objects, and test them to see if they were working correctly in terms of complexity, or too much complexity.”

YONATAN ASSOULINE
MANAGER & CO-FOUNDER | FLAMINGO WORKS

Shapeways was really great when we worked together before, which led us to reach out again. It’s been so helpful to talk with them about what we could do in every aspect of 3D printing and finishing, and it saved us a lot of time in experimentation.”
