How does it work Payments in action See how organizations are driving their business forward with our payment solutions. SHOPLINE Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), E-Commerce Platform “With Omise, payments become so smooth and seamless that they fade into the background, letting brands focus entirely on what matters most: their customers.” NocNoc Home & Living E-Commerce "Since furniture and home appliances are big-ticket purchases, installment options are crucial for NocNoc. By using Omise's white-label installment solution, we cut checkout time by 80%, making the experience faster and more secure for our customers." Monomax Streaming Platform “For an online streaming platform like Monomax, a reliable subscription payment system is at the heart of our operations. It is the key to steady revenue and reduced customer churn.” Soi Dog Foundation Nonprofit Organization Recurring payments are especially important to us. They provide stable, predictable support. That’s why we need a provider we can fully trust like Omise. GoWabi Online Booking Platform "Being an online platform, customer payments are of utmost importance for GoWabi. We chose Omise because they offer various payment methods, including credit cards, installment plans, and e-wallets." Coway Water Purifier “At Omise, we've found more than just a partner; it's a dynamic collaboration with a system that adapts to our needs, seamlessly managing a high volume of transactions and propelling our business forward.” McDonald's Thailand F&B "After integrating with Omise, we were able to solve quite a few things around customer experience. The significant changes we see are reduced drop-offs at checkout and also the reduced steps in which our customers have to go through to complete the purchase." Freshket Food Supply Chain Platform "The most important factor for Freshket when choosing a payment provider is system stability. If customers can’t make payments, it’s not just lost revenue; they may not be able to operate the next day, and that’s an even bigger problem" Pomelo E-commerce "For a business like Pomelo, there are certain times of the year where there are “peak sale periods”. It's really important that there are no interruptions on the checkout page. It’s one of the most sensitive stages in the entire purchase journey because a lot of conversions fail at the payment."
