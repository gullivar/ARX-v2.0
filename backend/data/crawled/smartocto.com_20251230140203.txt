Actionable AI-powered decision making

It’s all about smart analytics. Data-rich insights are essential in today’s newsrooms. That’s why we invented our smart notifications. We serve you just the information you need. These unique tips are customised to you, based on your content strategy and your business model.

A/B testing & page optimisation

Thanks to our A/B testing tool, you can optimise your website’s pages upfront. Test which headline resonates best with your audience or which leads and images attract more attention. This ensures the best results for each article while enhancing your website’s overall appeal. An AI plugin helps by suggesting alternative headlines and paragraphs.

Reports with unique content performance scores

Smartocto Insights is in perfect sync with every major publishing business model. With the help of our unique analytics solution, you can map the patterns in your readers’ behaviour and influence their actions. It's all about turning data into insights.

Customisable dashboards

Of course, when all this real time data is presented to you, you want to keep track of it, but no one expects a room full of journalists to constantly keep their eyes on our real time tool. After all, different organisations and even different people within your organisation might need different metrics and graphs to do their job. So we created something that can be adjusted to specific wishes or business goals. Waves is our standalone, fully customisable big screen.

User needs for news

We use smartocto in our newsroom to optimise our content performance. In principal we have all the data that we need to help us with this process ourselves, but the huge advantage that smartocto offers is that the relevant data is pushed to the end-user at the exact moment that he/she/they can make a difference. So for optimising our short-term performance, what can we do now to immediately become better at what we do, smartocto is indispensable.

Smartocto provides our newsroom with invaluable insights into what our readers care about and how they interact with our content. From decisions on what topics to cover to providing great feedback about the performance of individual authors, smartocto is a key tool for building our content strategy.

We couldn't be more satisfied with smartocto. We have been testing smartocto for more than 2 years now and I have been actively using it for more than 1 year now as an editor of a small website dedicated to media professionals in the region of Western Balkans. In cooperation with smartocto's regional staff we have been implementing their insights solution to 16 other regional media partners in our efforts to improve their editorial data driven decision making processes. Even though most of our media partners have been using some other widely available and free products they had trouble using it in their decision-making processes as they are not adapted for use in media. So far our partners who have been using this product longer have been more than satisfied and they started using it in their newsrooms on a daily basis to make better decisions for future work.

We use Smartocto for real-time dashboarding and advice to editors on how best to bring articles to the attention of our readers through various publication channels. All our online editorial offices in the Netherlands and Belgium work with Smartocto on a daily basis. We also use Smartocto Tentacles to test our headlines (which approach produces the most loyal readers).

Do user needs-focused articles perform better?

When you’re commissioning articles, you have two choices: to pull focus around a single user need - or to not. We'll show you the data.

How a baseline report sparked reflection and change in the newsroom

Smartocto recently introduced the option to order a baseline report. This is a document that holds up a mirror to the newsroom, offering a clear snapshot of its strengths and weaknesses. Check out what it did for Süddeutsche Zeitung.
