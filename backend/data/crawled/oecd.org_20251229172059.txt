Background shapes 21st century skills

Information-processing skills, including literacy, numeracy and adaptive problem solving, remain unevenly distributed across populations in OECD countries. For example, adults whose parents attained tertiary education score, on average, about half a standard deviation higher in all three core skills than those whose parents did not.

Growing up in a city is also associated with stronger skills than being raised in villages. Differences between men and women are smaller and vary by skill. Skills also tend to differ by immigrant background, reflecting differences in learning opportunities and language exposure. Skill levels vary by age, peaking in young adulthood and declining thereafter. The size and direction of these differences vary across countries, reflecting diverse education systems, labour markets and social contexts.

Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology capable of tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as understanding language, recognising patterns, and making decisions. AI holds the potential to address complex challenges from enhancing education and improving health care, to driving scientific innovation and climate action. But AI systems also pose risks to privacy, safety, security, and human autonomy. Effective governance is essential to ensure AI development and deployment are safe, secure and trustworthy, with policies and regulation that foster innovation and competition.

Development co-operation
The OECD designs international standards and guidelines for development co-operation, based on best practices, and monitors their implementation by its members. It works closely with member and partner countries, and other stakeholders (such as the United Nations and other multilateral entities) to help them implement their development commitments. It also invites developing country governments to take an active part in policy dialogue.

Gender equality
Despite progress in recent years, more work needs to be done across all OECD countries to secure gender equality, with women and girls still facing inappropriate disadvantages and barriers in most spheres of social and economic life. Gender equality must remain a priority, as a matter of basic human rights and long-term economic wellbeing and prosperity. It drives economic growth, strengthens democracy, enhances social cohesion and increases the well-being of all members of society.

Global value and supply chains
Global value chains (GVCs) account for about 70% of international trade, as services, raw materials, parts, and components cross borders – often multiple times. As the trend toward cross-border supply chains increases, new challenges are emerging around sustainability, efficiency, and resilience. This growing complexity calls for policies that take a whole-of-chain approach to supply chain management and global trade.

Tax transparency and international co-operation
In today’s globalised world, it is crucial that tax administrations work together to ensure the right amount of tax is paid to the right jurisdiction. The OECD is at the forefront of international efforts to use enhanced transparency and exchange of information to put an end to bank secrecy and fight tax evasion and avoidance.

Climate policy dashboard
The Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches (IFCMA) is a country member-driven initiative coordinated by the OECD, bringing together OECD and non-OECD countries, to support climate action through better data and information sharing, evidence-based mutual learning and inclusive multilateral dialogue. One of the key objectives of the IFCMA is to produce a systematic, comprehensive and high-quality database on countries’ mitigation and mitigation-relevant policies. The IFCMA Climate Policy Database offers detailed information on more than 1600 individual policy instruments within the 43 policy approaches in scope of the database.
