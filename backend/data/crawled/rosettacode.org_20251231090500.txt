The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.  Rosetta Code currently has 1,338 tasks , 398 draft tasks , and is aware of 982 languages , though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every language.
