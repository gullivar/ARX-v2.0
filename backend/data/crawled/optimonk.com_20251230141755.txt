I've used Privy, Justuno, Poptin and a heap of other pop management apps. OptiMonk is the best out of all of them. The user flows are awesome, the UX/UI is intuitive. Plus they offer a free account.

Super solid app! Just started doing email and SMS marketing and hated how unprofessional-looking the in-built pop-up templates were for the email and SMS apps. The Optimonk templates all look great right out of the gate!
