Some owners see the writing on the wall and put their homes up for sale at this point. Since this type of property is not officially in Foreclosure, buyers can negotiate with the bank to buy the house at a discount. Pre-foreclosures usually have less competition to purchase since they are often not widely known. Search Pre-Foreclosure Banked Owned Homes Browse Bank Owned and REO Homes Bank-owned properties have been repossessed by the bank. Purchasing these houses from lenders typically offers more significant discounts than buying homes from sellers directly, as long as you do your homework before making an offer. Researching purchase history information and comparing prices offered during previous auctions provides crucial insight into proper pricing amounts for these properties. Search Banked Owned Homes Home Auctions Browse Homes Sold at Auction Home auctions are part of the foreclosure process and often go the way you'd imagine: an auctioneer oversees the event and awards the property to the highest bidder. Auction properties are sold on an as-is basis. Doing your due diligence and knowing all the sale details can get you a fantastic deal.
