They have helped me dominate my league to the point that I'm called the Evil Empire by my league mates" Rick Himes @bigisland31 "I had never won a fantasy football league. Then I got the Draft Dominator app, and I've had at least one team in the championship game every year since" Pat Lane @plane_pats "Footballguys is the fantasy resource I mistakenly shared with some league-mates a few years ago. I used to have an edge, now I don't. Share the gift at your own risk..." Scott Petre @MrPetre2You "If I had to pick one site to meet my fantasy football needs, it would be Footballguys.com. They provide redraft, dynasty, IDP, DFS content and rankings from a strong lineup including Bloom, Waldman and Norton among others. Lineup Dominator is a time saver." Bob Nixon @bnixon21 "Advice and content so good I don't even share it with my wife in our home league. Especially my wife." Eric Fairbanks @EricSpeaks "The depth and variety of content is second to none. FBG hits on all styles of the game. Ingenious Draft Dominator singlehandedly makes your draft prep. In-season blows the competition away. Off season? There is no off-season in football and FBG keeps the information flowing." Fred @mission16W "I keep losing. To the only other guy who also uses Footballguys..." Bob Cagle @Krusador "I don't know how people manage a fantasy team without FBG. I couldn't do it without their Draft Dominator, Matchup Dominator, weekly rankings, articles, waiver wire and other tools." Shawn @TankInTN "Staff that take pride in their work. I feel like if I ever crossed paths with a FBG staff member they would be a wonderful person to chat with and it shows through their work."
