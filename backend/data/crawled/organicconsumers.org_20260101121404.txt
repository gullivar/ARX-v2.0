Ready for you to make your voice heard. >>TAKE ACTION: Remind Congress: It Appropriated $4.5B for Regenerative, It Can’t Let USDA Only Give It $700M! Congress Appropriated $4.5B for Regenerative, Why Is USDA Only Giving It $700M? Regenerative and organic farmers have never needed you more! The Trump Administration has been crashing a wrecking ball into the U.S. Department of Agriculture all year. Now it wants us to believe that two pennies is better than a dollar bill. Two is more than one, right? After refusing to disburse $6.062 billion appropriated by Congress for family famers adopting regenerative agriculture practices and serving local markets, we're now supposed to celebrate because the USDA is earmarking $700 million for regenerative agriculture, when it's given $40 billion in bailouts to industrial agriculture this year. >>TAKE ACTION: Tell Your State Legislators to Ban Bayer & ChemChina's Carcinogenic Pesticides! TAKE ACTION: Ban Bayer & ChemChina's Carcinogenic Herbicides It's official. The two pesticides we're exposed to the most are both "probable human carcinogens" according to the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The number-one, glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup (now owned by the German company Bayer), has held this dubious distinction since 2015. Now, the number-two, atrazine, used in Syngenta (ChemChina)'s AAtrex, has also been given this designation. This explains the mysterious rise of cancer among young adults in the Corn Belt. >>TAKE ACTION: Tell Congress to pass Rep. Pallone’s Grocery Reform and Safety Act, not AFIT’s misleading named “Better Food Disclosure Act”! Stop the Junk Food Lobby's "Americans for Ingredient Transparency" The biggest junk food manufacturers, from PepsiCo on down, created a Trojan horse they call “Americans for Ingredients Transparency” (AFIT) to get Congress to stop states from doing things like banning food dyes and getting ultraprocessed Frankenfoods out of school meals. We’ve just scored our first win against them! No one in Congress is willing to help them stop state action. >>TAKE ACTION: Tell Congress To Stand up for Local Ranchers, Not Imports! Support American Beef: Stand Up for Local Ranchers, Not Imports U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, has introduced the Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) Enforcement Act. The best part of the bill is that it expressly overrides international trade agreements. This is important, because the last time the U.S. government implemented mandatory country-of-origin labels, Canada and Mexico used the World Trade Organization to strike them down. It's about time Congress stood up to anti-democratic usurpations of national sovereignty! >>TAKE ACTION: Tell the U.S. Trade Representative to Protect Food & Farming! TAKE ACTION: Support Fair Trade with Mexico & Canada for GMOs, Avocados & Beef! International trade agreements help corporations evade national laws. Just like they've done with the WTO and NAFTA, companies like Monsanto (Bayer) are using the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to force countries to import food their people don’t want to eat and make local farmers compete with cheap, industrially produced imports. The Trump Administration is currently reviewing the USMCA. We need to stop the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade agreement from undermining food labeling & farmer protections! >>TAKE ACTION: Tell Congress to Support Real Regenerative Organic, Not GMO Microbes & mRNA Pesticides! Real Regenerative Organic--Not GMO Microbes & mRNA Pesticides! In the name of "soil health," Members of Congress are trying to pave the way for new genetically modified microbes and mRNA "pesticides" that could trigger a doomsday for agriculture that would jeopardize not only our ability to grow food, but imperil life as we know it on this planet. The FCPA could put a big dent in illegal logging, but on February 10, 2025, President Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop enforcing the law. This is bad news for the Organic Consumers Association's campaign to stop avocado-driven deforestation in Mexico and it's unleashing a larger corporate crime spree. >>TAKE ACTION: Tell Driscoll’s to stop poisoning the babies of California's Central Coast! Tell Driscoll’s to Stop Poisoning Babies! After California banned chlorpyrifos, the state's use of organophosphate pesticides decreased everywhere except in the Central Coast region where Driscoll's grows its strawberries. In Driscoll's Monterey County, use went up 26 percent and exposure is nearly unavoidable. >>Tell the EPA to Ban Bayer's Crop-Killing Dicamba Herbicide! TAKE ACTION: Tell the EPA to Ban Bayer's Crop-Killing Dicamba Herbicide! Bayer (Monsanto)’s Dicamba herbicide is meant to be used on its genetically modified Dicamba-tolerant crops, but when it gets sprayed, it is extremely drift prone, and drifts away from the GMO farms and causes extensive injury to cultivated and wild landscapes, insects, animals and humans. There has never been a weed killer that has been more destructive in terms of crop damage. Today’s Featured Stories CLICK HERE TO TAKE ACTION Want to Help?
