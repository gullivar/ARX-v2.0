“With Altium 365, all communication stays within the project, providing greater transparency, traceability, and accountability of all data."

Tibor Hegedis
Principal Electronics Engineer at Breville

“Altium 365 doesn’t make you feel like you’re connected to the cloud. You’re still working in a desktop environment with Altium Designer, so workflow isn’t broken and there’s nothing new to learn. Everything you need is just right there and it works.”

Madhu Annapragada
Founder at Automation Research Group

“Our electrical engineers and myself have been using Altium 365 every day from our homes to do everything from sharing designs to preserving tight revision and process controls that our bigger aerospace and aviation clients now expect.”
