People in Gaza need your help

"The recent ceasefire marks a turning point in two years of unimaginable horror. It offers a vital chance to save lives and ease suffering." Mirjana Spoljaric, ICRC President. The ICRC is acting as a neutral intermediary, reuniting hostages and detainees with their families.

We are also standing ready to increase our much needed assistance in Gaza.

Hospitals are overwhelmed, infrastructure is shattered, and unexploded ordnance continue to put lives at risk. Your generosity today turns this fragile opening into lifesaving relief for people who have endured far too much.
