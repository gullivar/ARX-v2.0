A standout is Dima Srouji and Piero Tomassoni’s Air of Firozabad/Air of Palestine (all works 2025 unless otherwise stated), in which hundreds of glass baubles, blown in the titular locations, are suspended over viewers’ heads on transparent wires, such that it seems they could at any moment fall, shatter, and thereby cause harm. Performa 2025 Sanna Almajedi Part of the anticipation of Performa Biennial is the prospect of artists who normally work in other media trying their hands at performance. This year’s commissions included artists working on a disparate array of historical and contemporary subjects: Diane Severin Nguyen explored the musical legacy of the Vietnam War, Sylvie Fleury guided us through a constellation of iconic Fluxus performances, Ayoung Kim presented a love story between two delivery drivers, and Pakui Hardware addressed the impacts of AI on mental health. Marcelo Cipis’s “Cipis on Black Friday” Oliver Basciano Gomide&Co Cipis has form for humorous exposés of art market mores. At the 1991 Bienal de São Paulo he established a fictional multinational company called Cipis Transworld, Art, Industry & Commerce, exhibiting the corporation’s double doors and door mat, reception desk, wares including soap, Pyrex, and shoe wax, and vitrines detailing the brand’s fictional heritage. His painting style, with its easily recognizable symbols, has the quality of advertising, and the motifs suggest shorthand associations. “Broken Column” Sean O’Toole Museo de la Ciudad de México Berzunza—a historian whose experience of “perpetual yearning” for love is central to his recent exhibition-making—prefers to describe himself as a “loser.” This stark characterization, appearing in a curatorial statement introducing his exhibition, is best taken with a pinch of salt. Born into a patrician family and largely schooled abroad, Berzunza has been shaking up what he perceives as Mexico’s fossilized art scene since entering it a decade ago. 23rd Loop Festival, “Miratges Mirages” Maria Walsh This theme of this year’s festival, the first under the artistic direction of Filipa Ramos, is the open-ended “Miratges Mirages.” As Ramos explained in an introductory talk, the Catalan/English title was inspired by a 1976 Joan Jonas work and alludes to the mirages of artists’ cinema as forms of desire or the promise of dreams. Two early films by Jonas (Wind, 1968, and Songdelay, 1973) were installed in two ornate gold-and-marble rooms at the Museu Picasso, their black-and-white pixellated footage further washed out by the glare of the museum’s chandeliers. Irma Hünerfauth Isabelle Bucklow Arcadia Missa Having practiced Art Informel under Conrad Westphal in 1962, Hünerfauth took a welding course, and her work’s trajectory changed. Soon after ‘68, she renounced paint “squeezed from a tube” and found her medium in matter extracted from minerals, fabricated, vitalized, drained, then discarded. Consciously infiltrating the “masculine domain” of Jean Tinguely and other kinetic artists, she began collecting scrap, welding together machine-like-assemblages.

At a time when these very values are imperiled the world over, it is of vital importance that we stop New School President Joel Towers, Provost Richard Kessler, and Chief Operating Officer Francisco Pineda in their efforts to dismantle the NSSR.
