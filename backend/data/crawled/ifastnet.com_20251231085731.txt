Testimonials I've used IfastNet for about one and a half years now, and I currently have a Monthly Standard account. One of the primary reasons I use IfastNet is that they are honest about their pricing. Most hosting companies advertise their services as being '$4.99' a month, but they demand you pay them a lump sum. IfastNet doesn't. You pay $4.99 every month, exactly as advertised. Another reason I use IfastNet is that they have wonderful support. They have assisted me with multiple problems, delving much deeper into individual site problems than one would expect. Their homepage doesn't lie when they say they have 'awesome support'. There are also many other reasons I use IfastNet, things like built-in integration of CloudFlare and Softaculous into cPanel, along with fast page loads and reliable uptime's. If you are on a budget and need a place to host your website, IfastNet provides amazing value, without forcing you to enter into lengthy contract and pay $150 at a time. --- Conor Jackson - United Kingdom I have used IfastNet for almost 2 years, with 1 Premium Ultimate account, 2 Premium Standard accounts and a reseller account, all of which are on yearly subscriptions. IfastNet's prices are insanely competitive and the support is top-notch. I have never had to wait longer than 1 day for a problem to be resolved and the support tickets usually have a turnaround of 2 to 3 hours, even on weekends. Keep it up, IfastNet. You have my business for as long as I am in business. --- John Rayfield UK - United Kingdom I strongly recommend iFastNet for two simple reasons. 1. They don't hike up their prices the minute your back is turned. 2. Their Support Ticket service is fast, efficient, comprehensible and above all, human. --- Darrell Foster Kirsop WordPress Developer I have been using iFastNet.com service for a long while and want to state they work great and have high uptime.
They use NVMe's for their premium hosting plans and their price is rather good for pure NVMe servers. The websites load up-to 1000% faster on
their new NVMe premium hosting!
As for their technicians, they are skillful and helpful any time I contact them. And they are fast and responsive.
The way they provide their service is quality and webmaster-friendly. --- Ratimutu Web Transfer Thinking of switching hosts?
