Is there anything we can use as a single solution? And Artifactory came to the rescue. It turned out to be a one-stop shop for us. It provided everything that we need. Keith Kreissl, Principal Developer, Cars.com By deploying JFrog, we’ve seen less vulnerabilities, which has given our developers more time to focus on developing new applications. And with the different development teams all being on the same platform, it has centralized and streamlined the process. Billy Norwood, CISO, FFF Enterprises Since moving to Artifactory, our team has been able to cut down our maintenance burden significantly… we’re able to move on and be a more in depth DevOps organization. Stefan Kraus, Software Engineer, Workiva I follow the basic principles for AppSec -- Prevent, Detect, Remediate. And when I look at the offerings from JFrog, they're checking those boxes for me. James Carter, Distinguished Engineer, Deloitte Before… delivering a new AI model took weeks... Now the research team can work independently and deliver while keeping the engineering and product teams happy. We had 5 new models running in production within 4 weeks. Idan Schwartz, Head of Research, Spot (by NetApp) As our business grew, JFrog Connect helped us enhance our operations. Being able to automate and push software updates across multiple devices at once saves us time and resources with each version we deployed. When you consider the cost of an engineer’s time, it was an easy call.
