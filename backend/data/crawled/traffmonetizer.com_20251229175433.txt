How does it work?

Your Internet Service Provider offers unlimited traffic bundles for a fixed monthly fee. However, there is a catch - most of the time you don't use your traffic and your connection is idle.
You can sell a part of this unused traffic and start earning passive income in four simple steps:

1. Sign up for our service and get an access token
2. Install our app on your device
3. We will be using a tiny part of your Internet connection in our network.
4. Use your account dashboard to track the traffic we used along and the money you earned.
