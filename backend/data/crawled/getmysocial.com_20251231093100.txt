Is it safe for my social media account? Yes! Our Shield technology is specifically designed to protect your account. By routing bots to a safe page and real users to your content, we actually reduce the risk of your account being flagged compared to direct linking. Which apps do you support deep linking for? We support all major social apps including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter (X), Telegram, Snapchat, and OnlyFans. Our system automatically detects the user's installed apps. Does the user have to log in again? No! That's the magic of GetMySocial. Because we open links in the native app or system browser (Safari/Chrome), users are usually already logged in, leading to much higher conversion rates. Can I use my own domain? Yes, Custom Domains are available on our Creator and Agency plans. This allows you to maintain your brand identity completely (e.g., links.yourbrand.com).
