TRUSTED PARTNERS m_t_40_ "User-friendly platform with powerful CRM tools and great customer support" p_t_50 m_t_50 m_t_50 . . < . . “We are very pleased with the simplicity of the system. We rarely spend time training staff as most users simply “get it". It’s a simple and fast out-of-the-box solution. We now have 4 client accounts running on Glue Up software.” Marcel Ewals Director, Community Development, MCI Group “So I have to say when we started connecting and talking with Glue Up, you guys were excellent in showing me the back end, how it actually works with live data. I could get in and see the system and see how it worked and see how the data was behaving and the functionality live and that's huge. If you can get your hands on it and actually see it and understand it, then that's a selling feature for me.” Roxanne Schutz Vice President, BC Chamber of Commerce ”Based on our positive experience, I highly recommend Glue Up. It's a powerful tool that delivers on its promises, provides a great user experience, and offers excellent value for the price. It has the potential to streamline operations, improve communication, and enhance overall organizational efficiency.” Kim Smouter Director, European Network Against Racism “Affordability is a critical aspect for non-profit organizations. Glue Up is affordable and has everything you need to manage your memberships, donations, fundraising, and events. As non-profits heavily rely on their membership database, Glue Up makes data management and life in general much easier. Glue Up also helps you increase outreach to not only your members but the broader community.” Sarah Arayuak-Thomson Membership and Mentorship Manager, The Indigenous Physicians Association of Canada (IPAC) “We’ve increased tremendously to the point where we’ve already surpassed our goal in membership for the year, which is partly because we’re able to gain memberships from ones we used to miss out on in our old system.” Allen Pratt Executive Director, The National Rural Education Association “I would definitely recommend Glue Up because it has streamlined all our membership management and event management processes. As a one-person office, Glue Up is my virtual assistant. Glue Up is very user-friendly and has simplified managing our organization. I have no plans of leaving Glue Up! Whether you’re a small association with 50 members or a large organization with 5000 members, Glue Up is a great system to use for managing your database.” Leah Ross Executive Director, Channel Islands Chapter, CAI > . p_t_50 p_t_50 Transforming Community Management Together Glue Up Joins the NVIDIA Inception Program Learn about partnership with NVIDIA > Glue Up Announces Strategic Partnership with Cvent Learn about partnership with Cvent > Glue Up Joins the ASAE Alliance Partner Program Learn about partnership with ASAE > Partnership with NVIDIA Glue Up Joins the NVIDIA Inception Program The the NVIDIA Inception Program provides Glue Up with the access to NVIDIA's state-of-the-art AI technology, marking a major step in transforming association management with next-gen AI solutions.
