By consolidating, we are able to reduce costs while improving performance and reducing risk by enhancing the Dorel Sports disaster recovery position. We rest assured that our applications are in good hands as NYI’s sales and technical support teams have proven very responsive and knowledgeable.” Dhiresh Jethwa Vice President & CIO, Dorel Sports “NYI treats us like real people. The company is more than just a monolithic building full of black boxes.

The company’s speed to service delivery is far ahead of any competitors; what took weeks with others takes just days or hours with NYI.” J.B. Zimmerman Operations Team Lead, Sailthru “NYI knows that small to mid-sized businesses want accessibility to the same DR/BCP resources enjoyed by the Fortune 500.” Bill Laperch CEO and President, AboveNet “As an industry leader in financial services technology solutions and services, NYI’s technological prowess in meeting customers’ needs was attractive to Alpha Plus.

Its highly professional staff is always present and willing to assist in any way they can.” Kevin Davis Trading Services, Alpha Plus “We had a massive DDOS attempted against us using the NTP flaw a while ago. [NYI] blocked just the NTP port to the one host being attacked, and informed us of the attack while they asked their upstream providers to push the block out onto the network to kill off the attack. Our customers didn’t even notice.” Rob Meuller Director, FastMail Featured Clients The Latest NYI News At Your Fingertips NYI is a trusted infrastructure partner to small and medium-sized enterprise clients across a range of industries.
