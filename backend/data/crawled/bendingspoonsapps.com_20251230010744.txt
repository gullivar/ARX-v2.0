Impossible. Maybe.

We own and operate leading digital products, including Evernote, komoot, Meetup, Remini, StreamYard, and WeTransfer. And we develop the technology to power them.

Our products have served nearly a billion people across the globe. Still, we’ve only just crossed the starting line on the road to building an all-time great company.

An impossible mission? Maybe.

Doing well and
doing good

We provide scholarships to groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. These include our scholarship initiatives for women in computer science and for students with disabilities.

We partner with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences to make STEM education more accessible in Africa.

We partner with Supercritical to offset 100% of our greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2020, we created and donated Immuni, Italy’s official COVID-19 contact tracing app.
