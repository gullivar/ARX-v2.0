You caught me at a good time as I am redoing my home page to make it better for mobile at my website.

Loving the additions to the new version of your website development app. It's a great, cleanly designed, user-friendly, non-bloated web design program, comparing wix, weebly, squarespace... So easy and a pleasure to use. I'm with you all the way with this wonderful project. Keep up the great work on this easy website builder software. David F. I thinks the world of Web development is becoming easier and easier but it's also making it harder for guys like me to find work because so many people want to use out-of-the-box responsive layout sites that are easy to implement and launch. I personally would much rather make a site from scratch than use a template. The app is quite cool though as it provides a drag and drop interface that can create decent looking and original websites that has a mobile website design as well. Ian G. I am very happy that you guys released this, not only it is a great idea it was executed properly. I will use this to build a basic site for a customer. i looked at the video and demo sites and was very happy with what could be done. I would really like to add more widgets to your free website builder software. I am confident that you will be at the top of the market if you add more functionality without loosing intuitiveness! What makes products like this great is many features but so easy to use Thanks! Rajat Sh. We needed a simple open source web site creation tool. We needed to quickly and easily get an attractive web site. We needed to do all of this without having to work through a “developer.” And, since 1995, I and millions of others have been living in frustration, because that tool has never, ever existed. Never. This tool is the holy grail, a flying unicorn… the loch ness monster… rare and amazing, and something nobody has ever actually seen. Jeffrey G. Hallo, Your program is one of the best website builder software I have tried to build a simple but effective websites, everything is fine, I even began to outline our new corporate and multiple product-oriented responsive websites! Igor Grandiose!!!! Best website builder software - testing under an hour and hooked me. While it is a great alternative for designers who are with short time and produce things for small customers. PixelsArts I had a quick 30 minute look at your software and liked the way it is so responsive. I especially liked the way you could change the view from mobile through tablet and then desktop. best wishes Cavan S. I just wanted to tell you how much I love your product — after coding sites since 1999 — I can have a world class landing page or simple site up in minutes. I’m having a freaking blast using this product of yours! :-) I am a perfect user for this Simple Website Builder, as I am that entrepreneur, the guy needing to frequently put up great web pages and small sites for new ideas, products, events, etc. in the course of running my busy business. Coding dumdums like me all over the world will flock to your AI software by the thousands and thousands for such a drag and drop platform for producing gorgeous, responsive, static sites with truly ZERO coding. Jack C. As someone who came to web design from graphic design I work visually & use WYSIWYG website builders with some limited code knowledge - enough to do some minor editing, insert code into head/body etc but that's about it. However the spectre of responsive web design has been weighing on my mind of late, even though I can & do create dedicated mobile websites it is a lot more work, although I do prefer the look of dedicated pages as responsive tend to be quite plain & all the same. But I know having a responsive option would be a good thing to be able to offer if I get clients that want it. Your Mobirise is the first responsive web builder software I have seen that is actually easy so importantly - intuitive!! Thanks!" Julie M. I am really impressed with the work put into creating this nice website program. I love the ease with which Websites can be built in a few minutes using this awesome product. I like the intuitive drag and drop process and the mobile-first approach. I love this product, but it seems incapable of creating corporate Websites, because of the simple designs. Generally, I want to commend you for your work. The product is awesome. With more block options, increased flexibility, Mobirise Website Maker would favorably compete with the top free website builder sofware - squarespace, godaddy, wix, weebly and probably - wordpress! I'll be standing by. Your product has great potential. Keep working. Chinoms U.
