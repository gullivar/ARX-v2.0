The Collective Confidence Factor
In B2B, the hardest part of any sale isn’t choosing the right partner – it’s finding the confidence to say yes. This episode introduces Buyability: the confidence that turns consideration into commitment. Featuring voices from LinkedIn, Bain, Monday.com and Stein, we explore why fear of messing up outweighs fear of missing out – and how great marketing builds the trust that helps whole teams, including the hidden buyers, say yes.
