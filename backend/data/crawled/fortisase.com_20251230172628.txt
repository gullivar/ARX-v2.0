FortiGuard Forensics
FortiSASE offers detailed analyses of endpoints through FortiGuard Forensics. This service generates reports on evidence of any suspicious activities and allows taking action to prevent, respond to, and recover from potential cybersecurity incidents.
SOC-as-a-Service
Perfect for smaller organizations without the space nor specialized personnel to run a security operations center (SOC), you can forward logs to Fortinet’s SOC-as-a-Service for real-time analysis of endpoints and alert administrators about potential threats to be remediated.
