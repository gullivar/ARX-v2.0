Pittsburgh, PA We found out that our daughter had some food sensitivities, so we used Thrive Market to find dairy-free items and gluten-free items that were completely missing from the shelves of local grocery stores and Thrive Market made our lives so much easier. Verified Shopper Brooke D. Niagara Falls, NY On a fixed income, I’ve been able to have access to things that I wouldn’t be able to have access to—and they’re delivered right to my door at great prices. Verified Shopper Alyson G. Watervliet, MI It’s important to me that I don’t compromise on the quality of the food. Thrive Market has given me the opportunity to afford this food and get it, because I would have to travel at least 30 miles (if not 50) to get to the nearest healthy grocery store. Verified Shopper Alla P. Charlotte, NC My son is the main reason why we enjoy Thrive Market so much, because I always look for healthy, organic and sustainable foods that are also affordable, and Thrive Market is definitely the place to go. Verified Shopper Andrea G. Oklahoma City, OK I wanted to give my children the options of having good, clean, healthy snacks, so it’s been so impactful to be able to do that and stock our pantry with options that are not high in sugar and that they both love.
