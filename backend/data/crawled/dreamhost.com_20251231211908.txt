Learn More Web Design Site Management SEO Marketing Web Development Frequently Asked Questions What is Web Hosting? Web hosting allows businesses, organizations, and individuals to make their websites or apps visible on the internet. Whether they're using a dedicated server, or sharing resources, every website is hosted on a server. The only way for a website to be visible on the internet is if it's hosted by a web hosting service provider, also known as a web host. In order to find a website, you type the domain name (or URL) into your browser. Your computer will then connect to the server where the website is hosted, and the webpage is delivered onto your screen. What Are the Different Types of Web Hosting Products DreamHost Offers? DreamHost offers a range of hosting plans that cater to all website hosting needs. Web Hosting Simple. Affordable. Perfect for Getting Started. Web hosting is the most budget-friendly way to get your site online – but like all great starter options, it comes with a few trade-offs. With web hosting, your site shares space and resources with others on the same server. Most of the time? Smooth sailing. But if one of your server neighbors throws a traffic party, your site might feel a little sluggish. We try our best to keep everyone playing nice, but if you’re planning for a big crowd — or a big launch — you may want to check out our VPS or Dedicated options for more power and peace of mind. So, what can I host on Web Hosting? Plenty! It’s a perfect fit for personal projects, small business sites, blogs, portfolios… Just about anything without wild traffic spikes. Consider it a starter home base on the web. Ready to get started? Learn more about web hosting.

DreamPress does the heavy lifting — so you can focus on your business. Learn more about DreamPress. VPS More Power, No Drama Need just a little more Oomph than web hosting can offer? Time to check out DreamHost VPS. It’s a Virtual Private Server, and it’s faster, more flexible, and made for sites that are ready to grow up (but not all the way to a dedicated server). With our VPS hosting, you get your own private slice of the server pie, without needing to worry about neighbor noise or resource hogging. In fact, we use Linux-VServer tech, to give your site the power and privacy it needs, while keeping things smooth and secure. Bonus: DreamHost’s VPS is available as an add-on to an existing DreamHost plan, but also as a standalone service! Web Hosting vs. VPS Hosting To use our favorite analogy, web hosting is like living in an apartment. It’s cozy, cost-effective, but you’re sharing everything. VPS is your own townhouse: more space, more control, and way better speed. You even get to decide how much RAM your site gets. Fancy. What can I host on a VPS? A virtual private server is ideal for high-traffic sites that have outgrown web hosting, e-commerce shops, business sites, designers, or developers who want more control… Really, anyone who needs reliable performance and stability (aka, most of us). Need more room to grow? Learn more about VPS. Dedicated All Yours, All the Time This is the big leagues. With a dedicated server, it’s just you and your files — no neighbors, no sharing, no compromises. You’ll get full root access (read: total control), so you can tweak and fine-tune your server exactly the way you like it. Just a heads up: if you break something while getting fancy with customizations, our Support team can’t always bail you out. We’ll try our best, but hey, with great power comes great responsibility, right? What can I host on a Dedicated server? Dedicated servers are fully-managed, business-class servers. They are perfect for resource-heavy apps that need some elbow room, developers who want root access and full control, and giant websites and businesses who need premium performance and reliability. Why go dedicated? Besides bragging rights? Your MySQL database lives right on the same server as your site, which means faster access and less waiting around. It’s built for serious performance, no matter how heavy your workload is. Go big or go web hosting. Learn more about dedicated hosting.
