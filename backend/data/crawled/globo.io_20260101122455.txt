This ensures that working with the application is fast, intuitive, and convenient. A special mention goes to the excellent support team, always ready to help and respond promptly to inquiries. We highly recommend this application to anyone looking for a reliable solution! Technotape Netherlands In our opinion, it’s the best mega menu app for Shopify - especially if you’re working with multiple languages and markets like we are. We tested several options, and this one stood out. Their support team has already helped us with two Liquid code issues and resolved both quickly. Great communication and very helpful overall. Beyond the Box PH Philippines I should recommend the Pre-Order Globo app because it saves time by letting customers place their orders in advance, helping them avoid long waits. The app is very easy to use, even for first-timers, making the ordering process smooth and hassle-free. It also helps businesses increase their sales by accepting more pre-orders, especially during busy hours. With clear and organized order details, it reduces mistakes and misunderstandings. Overall, it gives customers a better experience by making ordering faster, easier, and more convenient. BEAOLATA United States This is truly the app I've been longing for. I've tried many other apps but none of them could achieve the desired effect. However, this app has perfectly solved all my problems. It has significantly increased my conversion rate.

Forager Vintage United States This app has been great for all sorts of filters I need for Shopify, including colors, sizes, materials, etc. I’ve used it for a few years, and it’s been simple to use. In the rare case that I encounter a bug, support has been LIGHTNING FAST in fixing it. I’m leaving a review today after Helen helped me fix a bug within minutes of emailing. (I really appreciate it!!) They definitely won me as a customer. Great app, great customer service! F.R.S For Restless Sleepers Italy The app is very useful and intuitive to operate. It fills the customization gaps that many templates sometimes just cannot offer. Customer support is just outstanding: in our case, Helen provided a super quick and efficient solution to the issues we encountered. Dyonsu Australia Have been using this app for years and ran into my first issue just recently. I hit up support and they responded almost immediately, within 20minutes my issue was resolved and I couldn’t be happier. Great app, great support, worth 5 stars! Kendrick Home United States 5 Star PLUS! We built our whole website around this apps features and have LOVED how it performs for us and our customers. It looks great across all platforms and works perfect on mobile. It is easy to use and organize all of our products and product lines. The search feature is fun and interactive. The Perfect Bottle United Kingdom We love the filter system. Recently an error occurred where an extra 0 was being added to all our product costs in our collections in error. I got in touch with the team and they had it sorted within 30 minutes. Great service. ONI France Amazing Support & Customization Help! I just want to give a huge shoutout to the Globo Swatch devs and support team. They were incredibly responsive, friendly, and helpful throughout the entire process of customizing their app to fit exactly how I wanted it to look and function on my website. I had some specific layout and design needs, and they went above and beyond to make sure everything looked perfect. The app now integrates seamlessly with my site’s aesthetic and works exactly as I envisioned. It’s rare to find this level of support and willingness to assist with custom tweaks—I’m genuinely impressed and grateful. Highly recommended if you’re looking for a swatch app with both great functionality and an outstanding support team behind it! Sound Art Used Gear Canada Fantastic customer support, we have been using this app since we started with Shopify. Over the years we have had a couple of small issues. Both ended up being user error on our part. The Globo team jumped on these issues super fast (even after hours) and showed us what we were doing wrong. I highly recommend their products! Public Domain Image Library United Kingdom I looked at a lot of menu apps before settling on Globo. I found this the easiest to produce the results I needed. I started on the free menu but have now upgraded to make used of the tabbed menus. You need to work at it and it’s a bit trial and error, however the end results are worthwhile. You may also want to enter some custom CSS to get the best results. Support were always helpful, although their hours may not match up with your own as they’re in Vietnam! Nordic Catch United States Huge improvement to the standard menu in my Shopify theme! Took some getting used to on choosing the layouts I liked, but now that I’ve got it all done, there’s been great feedback from customers. Madeingbg Sweden Amazing support and very intuitive app to use, I have been using it earlier and then tried other apps, but I always come back to Globo. And a BIG shoutout to Henry in the support team, who helped me customize everything to my liking, even during night time! Fantôme United States After trying several other expensive apps that promised more features, I returned to Globo as it is easy to set up and reliable, with just as many customizations. Extremely responsive and helpful support, Gemma solved my special request super quickly! Sport4all United States It offers every feature you could imagine and effortlessly connects to your store even letting you add paid options, handling everything smoothly. Plus, being able to customize fonts and styles to match your store’s theme made a big difference. Rosie is amazing! Quote Lovin’ United Kingdom Sooooo easy to use!!! I even used it at one point as a kickstarter and replaced ‘pre-order’ with pledge now! Henry, you have been a great help and sending over screenshots has been super easy to follow along! Thank you! Khisa India Very crisp app, does it what its supposed. Fantastic customisation, in fact kind of tailor made. The Chat with us is so good. Instant help and changes as per requirement. Keep it up.
