1945 - END OF WAR

Eighty years ago Second World War ended in Europe and with it the Nazi reign of terror. Heidelberg University wishes to acknowledge this date by three projects during summer semester. The Ruperto Carola lecture series dealt with the end of the war from a retrospective perspective and by reconstructing the way it was immediately experienced. All lectures are available on HeiOnline. The photo exhibition entitled „1945: Heidelberg – all and everything lost?“ sheds light on the people and the complex, contradictory life in Heidelberg. And the images of photo journalist Leonard McCombe, who documented the consequences of the war from 1944 to 1946 on behalf of the Allies, portray the suffering of the population in France, Germany and Poland. Both exhibitions can be visited online.
