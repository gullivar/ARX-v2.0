Getting started is easy!

Checkout the text below, its generated on the fly by GeoJS itself.

Hello 59.15.130.228. The IP you're behind has a country code of KR.

All that from this little snippet:

Hello <span id="user_ip"><span class="icon"><i class="loader"></i></span></span>. The IP you're behind has a country code of <span id="user_countrycode"><span class="icon"><i class="loader"></i></span></span>.


<script type="application/javascript">
function geoip(json){
var userip      = document.getElementById("user_ip");
var countrycode = document.getElementById("user_countrycode");
userip.textContent      = json.ip;
countrycode.textContent = json.country_code;
}
</script>
<script async src="https://get.geojs.io/v1/ip/geo.js"></script>
