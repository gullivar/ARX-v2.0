Guys help what is that yaoi again that's plot is like, the ml is a depressed author I think and had a blond love interest in his dream but he couldn't see his face. Then there's also this mentally ill uke who had a toxic parent who worships something..

I think when uke and seme met, I think the seme wanted uke's hair as blond and uke dyed it as one without knowing that the seme is just doing that so he could see his first love interest in person..

Or maybe they met when the uke had blond hair and because of that, seme fell for him? But when uke found out that seme likes him because his hair was blond, they fought allat

OKAY so there are sex scences but like from what i can rmbr they arent like the plot of it and mainly focus on the characters stories
• Given (music, grief, and growing love)
• 19 Days (friendship, teasing, and slow romantic development)
• Heaven Official’s Blessing (fantasy, adventure, emotional bonds)
• Painter of the Night (slow-burn romance with emotional depth)
• Sign (cute slow romance, communication challenges, emotional story)
• Check, Please! (sports, friendship, and relationship growth)
• Love Shuttle (twisted personalities but focuses on romance & development)
• Seasons of Blossom (school life, emotional growth, slow romance)
• Colorful (slice-of-life, friendship turning into romance)
• My Cute Little Kitten (lighthearted romance, character connection over physical stuff)
These are the ones from the top of my head i cant give you more if i go through my list of reading but yeah here you goo~

I GOTCHUUU okay so
• Painter of the Night (painter MC is timid and struggles with self-worth, slowly grows with love)
• Sign (the café owner MC struggles with confidence but finds connection and trust)
• Given (Ritsuka starts off shy and unsure of himself, grows through music and romance)
• Colorful (MC is socially awkward, insecure, but learns self-acceptance through relationships)
• Love Shuttle (one MC is self-doubting, but finds courage and love through the other’s persistence)
• Seasons of Blossom (MCs deal with personal insecurities, but romance helps them heal)
• My Cute Little Kitten (MC is shy and self-effacing, gradually gains confidence via romance)
• Check, Please! (Eric is a bit anxious/insecure but develops self-worth through sports and love)
• TharnType (Tharn has some self-esteem issues, Type is protective; relationship growth is central)
• You Lie in April: Boys’ Love variant fancomics (shy/insecure MCs navigating love and expression)

Conan December 29, 2025 6:28 am

Not barakamon cause he’s not a high schooler and I’ve already watched the anime, lol.

Doesn’t actually really have to be a high schooler, but I do heavily prefer it to be a boy. Usually animanga with these kinda premises focus on girl mc’s. Don’t hate them, just overdone I guess.

It could also be something similar, like a spoiled rich kid experiencing commoner life styles or something.

Can't Think Straight is already up to Ch.100 but if you click on it and go to the chapter selection part you can see a blue button that says "Upload Chapter" and clicking on that will guide you through doing it. The chapter selection is under the summary (⌒▽⌒)

pixnter : ts so intimate peak yaoi
arie : Bet snake eyes dude is her real father whomp whomp
ABees : The story outside the romance is interesting too! I've reread it & it still holds up, but...

My one con is that Wonyoung never gets to fully explain his side of the story/what really happens. It's nice that TJ forgives him only getting bits & pieces but really it's like putting a bandaid on an uncleaned wound. I feel like he never fully understood WY's motivations

Chlo9 : Romance actually humanizes the mcs as long as it's well balanced and thought out.

Stop over reacting! It doesn't take away anything from the story
Sonic : This is terrible… but I somewhat want to keep tabs on this story and see the MC get out of there and succeed.. his wish of opening a coffee by the sea, I wish it could come true. but at the same time I don’t want to keep reading this.. ugh I wish there was a novel so I could skip straight to the end ( if that crazy ass author even has that figured out )

goofy goober : Idk but i just wanna laugh on how bad this is
Like I ain't even complaining cause this manhwa just made me laugh like a Maniac like it's so idk how to describe it maybe my humor is broken but that last panel just made me really think this is just pure fantasy and fetish for the author LIKE imagine your lucid dreaming and you go to another person's dream snd this is some fetish fever dream they were having like you can't look away because its entertaining but at the same time who thought of this  like ok author I don't what you are on but this is just baffling there's so many new ways you can think of your oc having sex and what position they're going to be HAHAHA WAIT THE TITLE BEING SNAKE HOLE HAHAHAHA

The Argue Master : Which is exactly why the scanlation team stopped uploading their work here and took down as many chapters as they could
Girl Issues : Thought their brains were degenerated enough, before they saw how the youngsters are doing, that's realistic
Yunnomzc : About how in the 'real world' everyone was open about reading hard core BL so much that they compared a real human to a character I am sure it probably gonna have a real explanation BUT I was thinking about the cdrama the desire I think Wich was toxic as hell but by the small little clips on tktk I didn't notice and I don't know in other countries but here everyone was talking about how good it was then I watched is super bad I feel like I could be something similar if we had a guy that looks and have the same name as the guys in the series I would probably be disgusted

Simper : I don’t want this to end bro 
kiamwa : HOLY SHITTT I FUCKINH KNEW IT. EVER SINCE THE BLONDE HOES' FIRST APPEARANCE, I KNEW HE GON BE A SECOND ML
ItzTinSeL : Im hoping she says "then I'll just kill myself again...if I can't have even him then Ill make sure EVERY. TIME. That you can't have me"

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?!?!?!?!?!? I THINK SHE SHOULD JUST STRIVE TO MAKE HIM MISERABLE.
A friendly fujo : Lloyd has been lloyd all along
JJul : thank you author for not ending it with a beach scene
darkprincess32 : I feel like I'm confused by all the raving reviews because I'm not a slice of life girlie. It just felt like nothing sauce everyday life. Mofos went to school, then went home, said I like you, share hugs, pass a test, blah blah blah. I get more excitement in my own daily life at this point. But I think the two main characters are pretty cool. Just a boring story, perhaps
+
Kim Yin Ji : I kinda wish he had asked him out alone first but knowing the mc personality ml had to do it on public so that the king will forced him lol last time to and mc will accept out of duty like last time ╮(￣▽￣)╭

nincha : FUCK TS PEAKKK
UncleMikami : Apparently this was originally a novel, then a j-drama, and now a manga

I’m sure they go into more depth in the novel, but this manga pace feels so rushed
potatoes : a man who yearns is a man who earns
soma : bro. just got caught up with shiki shit. mfks need to log off and take a breath, heated in a comment section is INSANE work  yes the story is good but defending the rape is crazy imo and why are we sending strays to innocent ppl, he just liked the headband that jae was wearing(?).
Avocado : His hair was blueee?!?! I thought he was blond
Mika : Ugh shitty family exploiting their idol child is so triggering to me... rest in peace Sulli
Quacck : I want moreeeee though moreeeeeeee but it's the end oof 
choco : wait wtf is this cliffhanger bruh can someone who read the novel pls spoil me  im confused and why does dohyun seem like he’s gonna start acting like a red flag
fujoqueen : Why do these types of manhwas always do this  why are you KISSING after he just threw up.. that's digested food your slurping up btw 
Froggy : Damn I need to catch up with this. The plot progressed a lot more than I thought it would.
⚠Do not spread site. : Its crazy how fast my smile disappeared as soon as I saw a red hair.#－.－)
