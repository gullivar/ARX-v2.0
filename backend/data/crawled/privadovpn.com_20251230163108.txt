Expert Reviews

Must admit this VPN has been like a breath of fresh air with the crowded players in the privacy market. Their Free service compelled me to try the premium version so far their server speeds have been quite fast though not quicker than their well established peers. 30 day money back guarantee is a plus. Their wireguard protocol (recent implementation) is an added bonus. A must have in my opinion to keep your data safe online + they own most of their servers (physical based) & not virtual.

So far so good! Only been two days! But I will update in the future as time goes on. Using it on my Nvidia Shield Pro android & Samsung S20+ here in Canada 🇨🇦 Both apps for my devices work smoothly! Nice simple Clean UI & easy to navigate settings for you to choose as you set up your locations & Protocols & so on! This review is for the Premium paid version. Sign up & paying was a breeze took me like 5 mins! And the holiday day special offer was a no-brainer 5 star service!!! 😎🥳

I really like how secure this VPN is compared to the other ones I’ve tried over the years. The app is pretty simple and it helps keep my downloads safe. Overall, it’s great for the price and helps me get the extra protection I need.

Great app, easily manageable and well setup. New features improved quite a bit. Possible Improvements, app shortcuts. Some apps no longer work through the shortcut with new version, when previously worked.. Protection is key and Privado provides that! Edit: version 3.33, new update has now improved with app shortcut!!
