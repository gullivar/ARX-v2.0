Until now, OneNote handled spelling and grammar based on your keyboard language, usually at the paragraph level. That worked fine, but it was not always ideal. Now, Microsoft is giving you more control. You can set a proofing language for an entire page, or even choose a default language that stays the same across all your notes, no matter which keyboard you use. You can still override it for individual paragraphs if you want. To try it, go to Review, then Language, and choose Set Proofing Language. This update is currently available to Windows Insiders. 2 14 days ago - Dec 17, 2025, 06:22 PM The latest AMD Chipset Software version 7.11.26.2142 is now available, and it finally adds official support for Windows 11 version 25H2. The update itself is fairly small. AMD says it mainly brings Windows 11 25H2 compatibility, an updated installer EULA, and a bunch of bug fixes across different chipset components. Several power management and Ryzen AI related drivers were also updated, and AMD added a few new drivers for newer Ryzen platforms. There are some known issues, though. Once you install any 7.x chipset driver, you cannot downgrade to older 6.x versions unless you fully uninstall it and manually delete leftover folders. If you recently moved to Windows 11 25H2 on an AMD system, this update is worth installing. 3 14 days ago - Dec 17, 2025, 06:14 PM Windows 11's Media Creation Tool now downloads the December 2025 update. After releasing the December 2025 Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 10 and Windows 11, Microsoft also began pushing Windows 11 to more supported PCs. If you want to upgrade in place, you can now do it by flipping a toggle in Windows Update, even from Windows 10. If you prefer a clean install, the Media Creation Tool is finally ready. It now includes Windows 11 and the latest December updates, making it easier to create a bootable USB drive. Some features still only activate after a clean install, so this option matters. One odd detail is that Microsoft has not updated the Media Creation Tool version number, even after recent bugs. Hopefully, this rollout is smoother than the last one.
