Your Full-Service Online Pipe, Tobacco, and Cigar Shop

Smokingpipes is your trusted full-service online tobacconist offering the largest selection of pipes, pipe tobacco, cigars, and smoking accessories for sale on the internet. Over the past 20 years, we've cultivated and nurtured relationships with the world's finest artisans, workshops, blending houses, and tabacaleras, assuring that only the best pipes, tobacco blends, smoking accessories, and cigars appear on our site — each carefully inspected to ensure it meets our exemplary standards.

Why Smokingpipes?

We understand that selecting a pipe is a deeply personal endeavor, which is why we photograph and describe every tobacco pipe on our site individually: Just like shopping in-person at a brick & mortar store, the pipe you see is the pipe you get. Moreover, our acclaimed customer service team is standing by to support your search — whether you're researching your very first pipe, looking for a new blend to expand your rotation, or browsing for the finest handmade artisan pipes to add to your collection.
