Building upon years of development on the Cfx.re framework, which has existed in various forms since 2014, FiveM is the original community-driven and source-available GTA V multiplayer modification project.
We put the community ― both players, server owners, and the greater GTA modding community ― first.

F.A.Q.
# Will I get banned from GTA:O for playing FiveM?

Nope! FiveM does not interact with the Rockstar Online Services other than to validate your game copy the first time you launch it. This validation emulates the game's interaction, and can not be detected by Rockstar.
FiveM also doesn't modify your game files at all, even when downloading server assets, so you don't have to do anything to switch between FiveM and GTA:O.

# Why are you asking me for login information?

We need to do this to check if you actually own GTA V, when our automatic validation fails. This data will only be sent to the Rockstar Social Club services, and is not transmitted to us, or any other party.

# Can I play FiveM on my console?

Unfortunately, offering FiveM on any game consoles is not feasible, since FiveM uses advanced interoperability mechanisms only available on the PC platform. Furthermore, FiveM relies on the PC platform being open to developers without requiring any approval from the platform owner.

# Will OneSync require me to redo my server code?

No, all your existing scripts will still work with the game when OneSync is released, with minor changes to support higher player counts. Of course, OneSync will enable new, better ways of doing certain things you do in your scripts, so you might want to take advantage of those when they're released.

# My FiveM crashes, what should I do?

You should post a topic on the forums with the problems you are experiencing. Please make sure to provide all information requested in the error format, so we can help you better.

# What does the M stand for?

Modifications, not multiplayer. FiveM provides both a singleplayer as multiplayer experience. This allows players to use our features in singleplayer as well.

# I want to run a server, how can I do so?

Running your own server is easy. Refer to our server page to get started. Running into trouble? Our community is there to help you. Don't hesitate to create post on our forums.

You can also rent a FiveM server via one of our authorized hosting partners and support the project.
