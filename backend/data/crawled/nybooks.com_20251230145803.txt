Current Issue
Robert P. Baird

God of the Gaps

Ross Douthat’s usual contrarian approach, in his recent book Believe, leads to a curiously impotent, watered-down account of religious experience.

January 15, 2026 issue

Jeremy Denk

Satie’s Spell

Erik Satie took down the arrogance of late Romantic classical music, gently but ruthlessly taking up its vocabulary and removing all the excess, including authorship.

January 15, 2026 issue

Andrew Katzenstein

Bamfordtown

Maria Bamford’s wild and constantly inventive stand-up style relies on her never flinching from the most difficult realities.

In Beryl Bainbridge’s novels, to die is an awfully big adventure—and so is to live.

January 15, 2026 issue

Michael Dirda

Panoply of the Weird

January 15, 2026 issue

Nicholas Guyatt

The Most Rancorous Line

How did the Mason–Dixon Line—meant to resolve a longstanding colonial border dispute—come to represent the US’s foundational divide between slavery and freedom?

December 19, 2025

Nawal Arjini

East Side Story

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
Frank Kermode

The Quest for the Magical Jesus

“Whether he was tattooed or crazy or a crook, Jesus can easily be fitted into a general view of what magicians were at the time thought to be: anything on the scale from mountebanks and peddlers of amulets to great sages and ‘divine men.’”

October 26, 1978 issue

Elizabeth Bruenig

Jesus, Mary, and Mary

If the Church and world persist for another two thousand years, the subject of Mary’s virginity will still be maddeningly controversial.

November 21, 2019 issue

Diarmaid MacCulloch

An Outsider from the Beginning

Sifting the contradictions of the Bible can bring Jesus and Mary into sharper focus and illuminate their surprisingly human features.

December 18, 2025 issue

Garry Wills

Jefferson’s Jesus

“The third president, converted to a cult of Jesus while he was in the White House, spent the last years of his life reading himself to sleep over the Gospels.”

November 24, 1983 issue

It Took a Village
Lucy Sante

My Lost City

“Aside from the matter of actual violence, drugs, and squalor, there was the fact that in the 1970s New York City was not a part of the United States at all. It was an offshore interzone with no shopping malls, few major chains, very few born-again Christians who had not been sent there on a mission, no golf courses, no subdivisions.”

November 6, 2003 issue

Charles Simic

Sundays at Slugs’

Following Ornette Coleman’s death, Charles Simic spoke to his brother Milan Simich, who has produced concerts and recordings for more than twenty-five years, about the avant-garde jazz scene in New York’s East Village that gave rise to that music.

July 29, 2015

Susannah Jacob, photographs by Radcliffe Roye

What Happened to the West Village?

The neighborhood became the epicenter of what the remorseless rise of rents will do to a once mixed and diverse city, rich foremost in its peoples and cultures.

October 9, 2019

Sam Fentress

Paradise on 13th Street

Hidden within the storied Greenwich Village hangout Spain were remnants of the neighborhood’s bohemian past.

Roderick MacFarquhar: Paddling to Peking

“Cowan entered China wearing his ‘Let It Be’ T-shirt, purple tie-dye pants, and a floppy yellow hat and carrying a bag of dirty clothes, condoms, and marijuana. His wave good-bye to the Western world as he crossed into China appeared on the front pages of The New York Times and other papers across the globe.”

Letters from Home
Ishmael Reed

The Buffalo I Knew

The city is at a crossroads. Which path will it take?

July 9, 2022

Ishion Hutchinson

Far Away

When I moved from Kingston to New York, V.S. Naipaul’s The Enigma of Arrival became part of my internal rhythm of resistance in the city, my bulwark against losing the gift of fantasy. 

October 21, 2022

Lucy Jakub

Maine’s Sublime Canvas

I grew up attuned to the strange contradictions of life in the rural yet cosmopolitan towns of Down East Maine, studded with galleries, where well-known writers hide out in old farmhouses.

September 12, 2020

Willa Glickman

A Park Apart

In Irina Rozovsky’s In Plain Air, Brooklyn’s Prospect Park is an oasis of recreation.

April 23, 2021

Under the Weather
Eduardo Halfon

My History with Needles

By strange alchemy, a treatment for allergies also cured my aversion to literature. It was those jabs that made me a writer.

June 23, 2021

Leslie Jamison

‘Since I Became Symptomatic’

When I wake with my heart pounding in the middle of the night, my sheets are soaked with sweat that must be full of virus. The virus is my new partner, our third companion in the apartment, wetly draped across my body in the night.

March 26, 2020

Oliver Sacks

The Feeling of Disorder

“I could say I felt well, in my usual state of health—at least such health and energy as a fairly active eighty-one-year-old can hope to enjoy—and this despite learning, a month earlier, that much of my liver was occupied by metastatic cancer.”

April 23, 2015 issue

Tony Judt

Night

“Morning brings some respite, though it says something about the lonely journey through the night that the prospect of being transferred to a wheelchair for the rest of the day should raise one’s spirits!”

January 14, 2010 issue

And the Oscar Goes to…
Darryl Pinckney

Moon Over Miami

Barry Jenkins’s film Moonlight isn’t trying to be realistic about anything, even as it confounds what we expect from stories about young black men, starting with the film’s texture, its intricate soundtrack, tantric pace, and beauty frame by frame.

April 20, 2017 issue

Francine Prose

Birdman’s Comic Horror

Birdman charges forward, headlong and without stopping, alternately scourging and exalting its audience with the genuine pain and the holy-fool ridiculousness of a “washed-up” former superhero.

January 28, 2015

John K. Fairbank

Born Too Late

The Last Emperor is a spectacular film photographed in brilliant color. It is also a moral drama with controversial political overtones of great ambiguity.

February 18, 1988 issue

Jason Epstein

A Dissent on ‘Schindler’s List’

Oskar Schindler was an exotic exception, and Stephen Spielberg lets viewers take comfort in his virtuous behavior, but the Holocaust raises terrible questions about humanity, and it is these questions that the director did not ask.

April 21, 1994 issue

Robert Craft

B-flat Movie

To give Amadeus every benefit of the doubt, we might assume that the presentation of Mozart as a fool is an intended irony, and congratulate the director for having chosen the best way to fail with an insoluble problem.

April 11, 1985 issue

Joan Didion

Letter from ‘Manhattan’

The characters in Manhattan and Annie Hall and Interiors are, with one exception, presented as adults, but their concerns and conversations are those of clever children acting out a yearbook fantasy of adult life.

August 16, 1979 issue

Brief Encounters
Diarmaid MacCulloch, interviewed by Chandler Fritz

A Christmas Story

“The Bible is a collection of texts beyond and outside us, and we may find its messages strange and even unwelcome. There’s nothing we can do about that, except to examine ourselves afresh.”

December 20, 2025

Yuri Slezkine, interviewed by Prudence Crowther

Investing in the Wrong Securities

“The less coherent and self-confident ‘the West’ is, the more it needs an outside threat.”

December 6, 2025

Anthony Domestico, interviewed by Lauren Kane

‘But Not Yet’

“For those people who feel that they haven’t accomplished enough yet—which is to say almost all of us!—Amy Clampitt’s life provides an allegory of persistence rewarded.”

November 29, 2025

Andrew Durbin, interviewed by Daniel Drake

‘Adventures in Sensations’

“I don’t know if we’ve ever lived in a moment when artists were as self-conscious about the state of their own markets.”

November 22, 2025

Israel and Gaza
Sari Bashi

Gaza: The Threat of Partition

By putting the possibility of reconstruction out of reach for many Palestinians in Gaza, the current UN-endorsed “peace plan” may make it impossible for them to remain. 

November 23, 2025

Sara Roy

What ‘Day After’ for Gaza?

The most influential plans for rebuilding Gaza start from the premise that Palestinians have no right to determine their future.

October 25, 2025

Joseph Kaplan Weinger

‘A Life That Is Not a Life’

My friend Awdah Hathaleen devoted himself to ending Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. His killing demonstrates just how little distance remains between settlers and the state.

September 5, 2025

Omer Bartov

‘Infinite License’

The memory of the Holocaust has, perversely, been enlisted to justify both the eradication of Gaza and the extraordinary silence with which that violence has been met.
