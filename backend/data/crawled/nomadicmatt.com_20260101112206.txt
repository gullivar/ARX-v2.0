Ten Years a Nomad: A Traveler’s Journey Home The book is a memoir of my ten years backpacking the world and the lessons I learned along the way. It follows the arc of a trip around the globe: getting the bug, the planning, setting off, the highs, the lows, the friendships made, the relationships forged (and lost), and the emotions you feel when it’s all over. Unlike my previous books, this is not a “how to” guide but a collection of insights, advice, and stories from the road meant to convey the experience of what it’s like to quit your job, follow the road not taken, and travel the world trying to discover who you are and what the world has to offer.
