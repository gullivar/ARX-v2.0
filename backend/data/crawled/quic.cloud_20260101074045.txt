Online Services

QUIC.cloud’s content delivery network is just the beginning.

QUIC.cloud takes
a two-pronged approach to speeding up your website:

CDN Service

minimizes the distance your content needs to travel

Online Services

minimize the volume of content that needs to be transmitted

Free Image Optimization

One way to speed up a website is to reduce file sizes and make content smaller and quicker to transmit. This is the role of Image Optimization. Shrink your images, and serve them faster.

Minimize image size with multiple optimization methods
Generate copies in next-generation WebP and AVIF formats
Process images automatically in the background
Improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metrics with smaller image files
Submit images for optimization upon upload to the media library, no need to wait for a cache hit

Page Optimization Services

Optimize CSS styling and page loading efficiency, to make your site faster and improve your page speed score.

Critical CSS (CCSS)

Inlines only the CSS necessary to style above-the-fold content, allowing the visible content to load fast and fully styled, before processing the rest of the CSS

Unique CSS (UCSS)

Provides customized CSS for each page, completely removing unused definitions and bloat, for a speedier page load overall

Low Quality Image Placeholder (LQIP)

Generates colorful lazy load placeholders to give your site a more pleasing look as it loads, and minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

Viewport Images (VPI):

automatically exclude above-the-fold imagery from lazy load
