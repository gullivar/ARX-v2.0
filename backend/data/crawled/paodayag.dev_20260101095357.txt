About Pao

Julian Paolo Dayag also known as Pao is a technology enthusiast and web application developer with a knack for building secure, optimized, and scalable digital solutions. The journey began in 2007, during the first year of high school, when Friendster a leading social network in Southeast Asia, introduced profile customization through CSS and JavaScript. What started as playful experimentation soon evolved into a deep passion for web development.

Since then, Pao has created tools and libraries now used by thousands worldwide, always with a focus on performance, security, and long-term scalability. Each project is approached with the same goal, which is to craft solutions that are both performant and reliable.

A strong advocate for open source, Pao makes all projects free to download and fully accessible to the community, because technology is at its best when it's shared.
