WHY SPRINGQUICKSTART
What Spring can do
Generative AI

Integrate AI into your Spring applications without reinventing the wheel.

Microservices

Quickly deliver production‑grade features with independently evolvable microservices.

Reactive

Spring's asynchronous, nonblocking architecture means you can get more from your computing resources.

Cloud

Your code, any cloud—we’ve got you covered. Connect and scale your services, whatever your platform.

Web apps

Frameworks for fast, secure, and responsive web applications connected to any data store.

Serverless

The ultimate flexibility. Scale up on demand and scale to zero when there’s no demand.

Event Driven

Integrate with your enterprise. React to business events. Act on your streaming data in realtime.

Batch

Automated tasks. Offline processing of data at a time to suit you.

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class DemoApplication {


@GetMapping("/helloworld")
public String hello() {
return"Hello World!";
}
}
Level up your Java™ code

With Spring Boot in your app, just a few lines of code is all you need to start building services like a boss.

New to Spring? Try our simple quickstart guide.

Most [of our] services today are all based on Spring Boot. I think the most important thing is that [Spring] has just been very well maintained over the years...that is important for us for the long term because we don’t want to be switching to a new framework every two years.
