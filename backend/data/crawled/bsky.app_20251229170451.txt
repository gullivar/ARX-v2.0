Got my first ever decent Pronghorn photo this year out at Carrizo Plain! This buck obliged me and my lens but after a few minutes I moved on and left him alone—after taking a billion photos first of course! #Photography #Nature

Every day I write down an LFT (look forward to). And for the next two months it will be this. We are so close to the World Baseball Classic! And this year Team America will have an A list pitching staff. Remember when they all stayed home last time then felt like big ole dummies lol

“Plastic surgery is often sold as a way of looking 10, 15, 20 years younger,” Marisa Meltzer writes. “But many famous people who are getting work done do not necessarily look like a younger version of themselves anymore; they simply look expensive.”
Opinion | I Love My Naturally Aging Face
But when I see Demi Moore, 63, looking far younger than me at 48, I wonder if I should be figuring out a way to keep up.

Finsihed Reading Frankenstein!

Really liked it. I love the flowery prose, particularly in regards to how Shelley describes nature. Neat stuff.

I like how in the events preceeding the Monster's creation, Victor's so incredibly full of whimsy and hope, just to re-iterate that shit's about to get bad

I posted about this one before, but it did end up as the second favorite book I read in 2025 so I’m sharing it one more time. 

I like John Irving to begin with but The Hotel New Hampshire covered it all for me. Just the right amount of dark humor that I like.

During my brief interval, the well-being of the Bookshop was enquired after, which I thought very kind, indeed.

The Bookshop is indeed thriving in the quiet, enjoying its own demi-retirement. We engaged a very meticulous, discreet caretaker for our periods of absence.
It's working beautifully.
