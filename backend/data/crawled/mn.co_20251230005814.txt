$1M? Really?

It’s closer than you think. The average membership on Mighty charges $48/month. That means a big business can start with a small email list, existing membership—or even the contacts in your phone.

People magic is powerful

We help your members meet and connect. The concept is ancient, but the technology is advanced. The results speak for themselves.

Profiles that look so good we should be a dating app

Your members bring their wins, struggles, experiences and goals. We help you spotlight and celebrate it all.

Introductions and icebreakers without awkwardness

Every member sees the community through their own unique lens—who’s like me? Who should I meet? How can I break the ice?

Thoughtful features, done just right? Change can be fun

Moving to Mighty unlocks a playground, not just a platform.

Sure, they help you save time. You can also shower members with confetti, unlock secret rewards, and dole out custom badges.
