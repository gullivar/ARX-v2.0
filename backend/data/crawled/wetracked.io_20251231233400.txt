Do you have more questions? Contact our support team at support@wetracked.io How are you different from adding the native ad tracking scripts? Native ad tracking scripts, or even the Conversion API, only track about 40% and this number is declining every month. We track all data points with our unique cookieless tracking method. Ensuring precise customer tracking, resilient against the iOS14 update and adblockers. The first-party tracking, data enrichment, and integration with ad channels create a near 100% accuracy, resolving tracking challenges. How is using wetracked.io different from Meta’s Conversion API (CAPI)? Meta’s CAPI is just a connection. It only sends the data your store can capture, which is usually incomplete because of iOS restrictions, cookies, and ad blockers. Wetracked.io captures far more data points, stitches sessions together server-side, and pushes back a full, accurate picture of every conversion. That’s why our clients see 95–100% accuracy and higher ROAS, instead of the inflated or misleading numbers you get from using CAPI alone. Will this work if customers use ad blockers or iOS 14+? Yes. That’s exactly why wetracked.io exists. We track events server-side and stitch sessions together, so nothing gets lost to blockers. Why not just use basic server-side tracking? Basic server-side tracking only sends the limited data your store collects. Wetracked.io enriches and completes the data, so your ad platforms get the full picture and your ROAS actually improves. Do you offer a money back guarantee? Yes! We’re highly confident that our solution offers the most accurate tracking out there. If the data doesn’t match your real data, you will get your money back. Is wetracked.io GDPR compliant? Yes! We build a digital fingerprint that is GDPR compliant, while still being highly accurate. Do I need to have technical experience or a developer? No! We offer a seamless integration with Shopify, WooCommerce, several checkout plugins, and soon other platforms. Why are you better than other tracking solutions? Other tracking solutions often use computer modeling to estimate conversions. We only use real data, real numbers, and track this accurately, without any modeling. We make sure this accurate data is pushed back into the ad managers connected to your account, so no additional dashboard is needed. This all makes us the most reliable solution out there. Do you use computer modeling to estimate conversions? We guarantee the highest ad tracking accuracy by collecting extensive data points, enriching them with our proprietary software, and directly integrating with ad managers for precise and reliable results. How can you guarantee the highest ad tracking accuracy in the market? We guarantee the highest ad tracking accuracy by collecting extensive data points, enriching them with our proprietary software, and directly integrating with ad managers for precise and reliable results.
