LiveX AI delivers human-like agents that power customer engagement across digital and physical worlds — from web chat and in-app to voice, QR, kiosks, and holograms. They engage, act, and resolve in real time, turning support and sales into measurable growth. How is this different from tools like Intercom or other AI assistants? Most tools automate messages or ticket routing. LiveX AI agents go further: they take actions inside your systems — updating orders, changing accounts, processing payments, and guiding retention. They connect the entire user journey — presale, support, and churn control — with one unified intelligence layer. How is LiveX different from other AI Agent vendors? LiveX is the only AI Agent platform in the world that unifies customer engagement across every digital and physical touchpoint — including web, app, chat, email, SMS, voice, QR codes, in-store kiosks, and holograms .Unlike limited chat or workflow bots, LiveX connects every channel through one data and action layer. It’s also the only AI Agent platform built for retail and enterprise CX , backed by Google Cloud and NVIDIA , ensuring unmatched reliability, scalability, and performance. How do we “set up” a LiveX AI agent? Integration is fast. LiveX connects directly to the systems you already use — Shopify, Salesforce, Zendesk, Stripe, and others. No-code onboarding gets you started, or use APIs for deeper control. Most enterprises deploy in under 30 days. What kind of work can agents take off our plate? Agents resolve Tier 1 support, manage FAQs, process returns, upsell products, schedule calls, and handle cancellations or billing updates. They free human teams to focus on high-value interactions and complex cases. Can we trust the output from LiveX AI agents? Yes. Every action is logged, auditable, and governed . Enterprises can define permissions, require human confirmation for sensitive steps, and monitor agent behavior through analytics and version control. Who is LiveX AI for? B2C brands across industries — digital commerce, SaaS, retail, media, hospitality, and more — that want to transform CX into a growth engine through automation that feels human. How do users interact with agents? Users can engage through any channel: web chat, app, SMS, email, phone, voice, or even physical locations via QR or holograms. The experience is conversational, contextual, and continuous — users can pick up where they left off on any device. How long does it take to get up and running? Typical enterprise rollout: under a month . Faster for digital-only deployments, slightly longer for hybrid or on-premise configurations. How do we manage and govern agents over time? LiveX provides full governance and transparency over every AI agent. Each deployment includes an Agent Flow Builder — a visual interface that maps how agents act, respond, and make decisions.Our solutions team sets up the initial flows for your enterprise and trains your team to modify them independently. This allows you to adjust workflows, guardrails, and escalation logic anytime, without code. All actions are logged, auditable, and version-controlled , ensuring compliance and continuous improvement. Your enterprise growth, on autopilot.
