Working with Clarivoy has allowed us to significantly lower our cost-per-sale for all things digital... . FAQS Frequently Asked Questions . How Does Clarivoy’s Multi-Touch Sales Attribution Solution Work?  Clarivoy’s Multi-Touch Sales Attribution Dashboard allows our clients to view a consumer’s full purchase path, sorting and ranking the true influence of each channel’s contribution – paid search, display, email, third party auto, organic search, social, cross family, video, Tier 1 and Tier 2. What is fractionalization within Multi-Touch Attribution?  We distribute credit across all touchpoints ensuring every source that influenced a sale receives proper credit​. Why should I use Clarivoy’s Multi-Touch Sales Attribution solution?  Because we aren’t an automotive digital marketing agency, we can provide independent, unbiased analytics. We don’t have any skin in the game with regards to which channels come out ahead. What is a touchpoint?  A touchpoint refers to a customer interaction with a marketing effort, such as receiving a direct mail, opening an email, or viewing a CTV/OTT ad, regardless of their response. What is Multi-Touch Attribution?  Multi-touch attribution is a method used in marketing to evaluate the impact of each touchpoint in a customer's journey on the eventual outcome, such as a sale or conversion. Unlike single-touch attribution models that credit a single touchpoint (like the first or last interaction) for the conversion, multi-touch attribution recognizes that multiple interactions across different channels and at different times contribute to the sale or conversion. Clarivoy utilizes the following MTA models: Parabolic, Binomial and Even (Linear) Attribution. What data do I to share with Clarivoy to optimize my results?  To create the most comprehensive consumer purchase journeys to enable actionable insights, we recommend using the following sources: Sales Records, Chat Records, Inbound Phone Call Logs, Third Party Auto Leads, Website Lead Forms, Digital Marketing (Paid Search, Social and Display), Email Reports, Direct Mail Marketing, CRM Data in tandem with Clarivoy's website tracking code and Automotive Identity Graph.
