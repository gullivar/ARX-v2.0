                                    major issues with
                                    the third, with another company, I am also moving it to Web Hosting Pad. Their
                                    people are amazing.
                                    They are willing to go above and beyond to help. They are always clear, patient,
                                    and available to
                                    help. Plus, their prices are lower than most. I recommend them highly and
                                    without reservation. Rabbi Shlomo Nachman I have had WebHostingPad for years... They have always been so helping when I
                                    have had a problem
                                    with my websites..
                                    I was not able to create new pages this morning without getting an error
                                    message.... I sent in a
                                    ticket and Tom helped me get it sorted.... In no time at all I was back up and
                                    running again.... Cindy Bolky WebHostingPad.com support team is amazing, 5 minutes is the longest I have ever
                                    waited for a
                                    response to any of my concerns. They have always been extremely willing to
                                    resolve any of my
                                    website issues, evening non-host related problems, like discovering ad fixing
                                    bad codes. I host
                                    all my site through Webhostingpad.com for their impeccable support service. They
                                    are great!! Skillfinder Trinidad & Tobago I was very impressed by the support provided by Tom G. at Webhostingpad.com. I
                                    had a strange
                                    email configuration issue that he was able to resolve for me. Not only did he
                                    solve the issue, but
                                    took time to explain why I had the configuration difficulty I had. This type of
                                    support was above
                                    and beyond what was expected. Often, when you subscribe to a budget service, one
                                    is disappointed
                                    in service and support. This is NOT the case with Webhostingpad.com. Peter Heyman more reviews can be
