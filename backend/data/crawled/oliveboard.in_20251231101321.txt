Vishnu Sir's video helped me in the last time. Mock tests of Oliveboard help you to be prepared for the worst conditions. Akash Sharma RRB Clerk I had subscribed to a free interview course by Oliveboard. I appeared for the mock interview & the panel members helped me in my weaker sections. Their help, guidance & mentorship made me fortunate enough to clear NABARD Grade A Interview. My interview went for the longest time that day. One advice I will give is to sit, focus on study & then revise especially for the Agriculture part (ARD section). Practice more for descriptive. I thank the Oliveboard team for being a part of my successful journey. SURAJ KR. PRAJAPATI Cleared NABARD Gr. A I initially watched a few video lectures on reasoning, and they appeared to be of good quality. Oliveboard is known for its high-quality content, and the faculty is always ready to help. Thank you, Oliveboard team, for helping students achieve their dreams! Shinde Mangesh Dhanaji SSC CGL Oliveboard has helped me right from the beginning of my preparation journey since IBPS PO and getting through RBI Grade B was not possible without Oliveboard's Phase I & II Mock Tests.
