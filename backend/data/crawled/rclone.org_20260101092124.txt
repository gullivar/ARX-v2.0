What features does rclone have? What providers does rclone support? Download Install About rclone Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It
is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. Over 70 cloud storage products support
rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage
services, as well as standard transfer protocols. Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and --dry-run protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its API . Users call rclone "The Swiss army knife of cloud storage" , and "Technology indistinguishable from magic" . Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from
the last good file transferred. You can check the integrity of your files. Where
possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without
using local disk. Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply encryption , compression , chunking , hashing and joining . Rclone mounts any local, cloud or
virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows,
macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over SFTP , HTTP , WebDAV , FTP and DLNA . Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync
and written in Go . The friendly support
community is familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest
version downloading from rclone.org is recommended. Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party
developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business
process solutions using the rclone command line or API. Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage. What can rclone do for you? Rclone helps you: Backup (and encrypt) files to cloud storage Restore (and decrypt) files from cloud storage Mirror cloud data to other cloud services or locally Migrate data to the cloud, or between cloud storage vendors Mount multiple, encrypted, cached or diverse cloud storage as a disk Analyse and account for data held on cloud storage using lsf , ljson , size , ncdu Union file systems together to present multiple local and/or cloud
file systems as one Features Transfers MD5, SHA1 hashes are checked at all times for file integrity Timestamps are preserved on files Operations can be restarted at any time Can be to and from network, e.g. two different cloud providers Can use multi-threaded downloads to local disk Copy new or changed files to cloud storage Sync (one way) to make a directory identical Bisync (two way) to keep two directories in sync bidirectionally Move files to cloud storage deleting the local after
verification Check hashes and for missing/extra files Mount your cloud storage as a network disk Serve local or remote files over HTTP / WebDav / FTP / SFTP / DLNA Experimental Web based GUI Supported providers (There are many others, built on standard protocols such as
WebDAV or S3, that work out of the box.) 1Fichier Home Config Akamai Netstorage Home Config Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS) Home Config Amazon S3 Home Config Backblaze B2 Home Config Box Home Config Ceph Home Config China Mobile Ecloud Elastic Object Storage (EOS) Home Config Arvan Cloud Object Storage (AOS) Home Config Citrix ShareFile Home Config Cloudflare R2 Home Config Cloudinary Home Config Cubbit DS3 Home Config DigitalOcean Spaces Home Config Digi Storage Home Config Dreamhost Home Config Dropbox Home Config Enterprise File Fabric Home Config Exaba Home Config Fastmail Files Home Config FileLu Cloud Storage Home Config FileLu S5 (S3-Compatible Object Storage) Home Config Files.com Home Config FlashBlade Home Config FTP Home Config Gofile Home Config Google Cloud Storage Home Config Google Drive Home Config Google Photos Home Config HDFS Home Config Hetzner Object Storage Home Config Hetzner Storage Box Home Config HiDrive Home Config HTTP Home Config Huawei OBS Home Config iCloud Drive Home Config ImageKit Home Config Internet Archive Home Config Jottacloud Home Config IBM COS S3 Home Config IDrive e2 Home Config Intercolo Object Storage Home Config IONOS Cloud Home Config Koofr Home Config Leviia Object Storage Home Config Liara Object Storage Home Config Linkbox Home Config Linode Object Storage Home Config Magalu Home Config Mail.ru Cloud Home Config Memset Memstore Home Config MEGA Home Config MEGA S4 Home Config Memory Home Config Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Home Config Microsoft Azure Files Storage Home Config Microsoft OneDrive Home Config Minio Home Config Nextcloud Home Config Blomp Cloud Storage Home Config OpenDrive Home Config OpenStack Swift Home Config Oracle Cloud Storage Swift Home Config Oracle Object Storage Home Config Outscale Home Config OVHcloud Object Storage (Swift) Home Config OVHcloud Object Storage (S3-compatible) Home Config ownCloud Home Config pCloud Home Config Petabox Home Config PikPak Home Config Pixeldrain Home Config premiumize.me Home Config put.io Home Config Proton Drive Home Config QingStor Home Config Qiniu Cloud Object Storage (Kodo) Home Config Quatrix by Maytech Home Config Rabata Cloud Storage Home Config RackCorp Object Storage Home Config Rackspace Cloud Files Home Config Rclone Serve S3 Home Config rsync.net Home Config Scaleway Home Config Seafile Home Config Seagate Lyve Cloud Home Config SeaweedFS Home Config Selectel Home Config Servercore Object Storage Home Config SFTP Home Config Sia Home Config SMB / CIFS Home Config Spectra Logic Home Config StackPath Home Config Storj Home Config Synology Home Config SugarSync Home Config Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) Home Config Uloz.to Home Config Uptobox Home Config Wasabi Home Config WebDAV Home Config Yandex Disk Home Config Zoho WorkDrive Home Config Zata Home Config The local filesystem Home Config Virtual providers These backends adapt or modify other storage providers: Alias: Rename existing remotes Home Config Archive: Read archive files Home Config Cache: Cache remotes (DEPRECATED) Home Config Chunker: Split large files Home Config Combine: Combine multiple remotes into a directory tree Home Config Compress: Compress files Home Config Crypt: Encrypt files Home Config Hasher: Hash files Home Config Union: Join multiple remotes to work together Home Config Links Home page GitHub project page for source and bug tracker Rclone Forum Downloads Platinum Sponsor Gold Sponsor Gold Sponsor Silver Sponsor Silver Sponsor Silver Sponsor Share and Enjoy Twitter Facebook Reddit Links Rclone forum GitHub project Rclone Wiki Sponsor @njcw © Nick Craig-Wood 2014-2025 Source file _index.md last updated 2025-11-02 Uploaded with rclone .
