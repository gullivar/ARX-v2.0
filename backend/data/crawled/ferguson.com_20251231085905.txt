PLACING ORDERS THROUGH THE WEBSITE.
a) Product Descriptions. Ferguson attempts to provide product descriptions that are as accurate as possible. However, Ferguson does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of this Website is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product You purchase from us is not as described, Your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition. We have also made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and finishes of the products that appear on the Website. However, as the actual colors You see will depend on Your monitor, we cannot guarantee that Your monitor's display of any color or finish will be accurate. b) Product Availability. The availability, product packaging, quality, quantity, price, discounts, charges, and fees for any product, service, or program found on the Website are subject to change at any time without notice. Ferguson may take any or all of the following actions at any time, with or without notice: (1) limiting the availability of any product, service, or program; (2) discontinuing any product, service, or program; (3) restricting any purchase; (4) cancelling any purchase; or (5) refusing any order. Products may not be available on Ferguson.com at all times. Some products may be subject to additional terms, conditions, policies, and disclosures. If You order a product that is out of stock, We will contact You to advise of the estimated shipping date for back-order items, and to determine if any modification to Your order is necessary. Ferguson may, in its sole discretion and with or without notice, limit Your order or the quantity of a particular product that You may order. Ferguson reserves the right to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may be applicable to orders placed by the same payment account and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address, or same email address. We will contact You should such limits be applied. Ferguson also reserves the right to prohibit sales to dealers. c) Pricing. While Ferguson strives to provide accurate product and pricing information, pricing or typographical errors may occur. In the event that an item is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information, Ferguson shall have the right, at Our sole discretion, to either contact You for instructions or cancel Your order and notify You of such cancellation. Prices are in U.S. dollars and do not include applicable taxes, if any. Promotional prices and discount offers are valid only during the applicable period established for the program. Prices and availability are subject to change without notice. Ferguson has the right to cancel any order for products or services listed at an incorrect price due to any error, whether or not the order has been confirmed. Ferguson will provide notice to You when cancelling any such order. d) Purchase Limits. Ferguson may, in its sole discretion, establish a spending limit for Your account. Your payment card issuer may also establish spending limits that affect Your right to place orders through the Website. You should consult the cardholder agreement between You and Your payment card issuer to determine what limits, if any, exist. e) Updating or Cancelling an Order. Please note that there may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must cancel. We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Some situations that may result in Your order being canceled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by Our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact You if all or any portion of Your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept Your order. If Your order is canceled after payment has been received, we will issue a credit by the charged payment method for the amount of the charge, or by an alternate method in Our sole discretion. You cannot cancel an order on the Website; an order can be cancelled by You only by speaking with a sales associate. f) Method of Payment; Billing and Payments. You must make appropriate arrangements to provide a valid method of payment, including without limitation a valid credit or debit card, to order products through the Website. You authorize Ferguson to charge Your chosen method of payment for all purchases made through Your account on the Website, plus applicable taxes, fees and other charges (including sales tax, service fee, and delivery charge). You represent that You have the legal right to use any method of payment You provide, and You agree to pay for any order through the Website placed by You or anyone using Your account regardless of whether You authorized that person’s activities or actions. g) Reservation of Rights. When You place an order through the Website, it will be subject to Ferguson’s acceptance. Ferguson may require verification of information before accepting or fulfilling any order. An order number or order confirmation does not indicate that Ferguson has accepted Your order. At any time after receiving Your order, Ferguson may accept or decline it for any or no reason and without liability to You or anyone else. If Ferguson cancels an order for which Your method of payment has already been charged, Ferguson will issue a refund to You. All returns and refunds for orders placed on the Website are subject to Ferguson’s Returns and Cancellation Policy. h) Delivery Terms. Ferguson will deliver Your order to the delivery address You provide at the time of purchase. We will conclusively presume that anyone at the delivery address who receives and accepts the delivery is authorized by You to do so, regardless of whether You authorized that person’s actions or activities. If no one is at the delivery address at the specified time nor any delivery instructions provided for unattended (contactless) delivery or otherwise, We may not deliver Your order, and You may be charged a restocking fee or the cost of return shipping. In the case of unattended (contactless) deliveries, Your order will be delivered to the delivery address provided at the time of purchase regardless of whether someone is there to receive and accept delivery. You are responsible for properly storing Your items promptly after delivery. Ferguson cannot guarantee the quality of items that are not properly stored promptly after delivery. i) Pro Pick-up alternatives. "Pro Pick-Up" or "Pro Pick-Up within one hour" may be available as an alternative to standard order delivery based upon the product(s) ordered, store location, and local inventory. The Pro Pick-Up alternatives that may be available for Your order, if any, will be identified at checkout. "Pro Pick-Up" or "Pro Pick-Up within one hour" are limited to specific hours that vary by store location, and Ferguson is not responsible and assumes no liability for the failure or inability to complete a designated pick-up within the applicable time period. Your Pro Pick-up location will default to the store location designated on the website. If You would like to arrange for pick-up at another location (where available), You may change to another available store location. When ordering over the phone, advise the Ferguson associate that you prefer to pick-up Your order, the preferred store location, and the Pro Pick-Up alternative You would like to use for the order, and the Ferguson associate will confirm availability, store location, and time for pick-up. When ordering online, You will receive an order confirmation by email or text (if You have opted-in to receive text messaging) confirming the scheduled date and time that You order will be ready for pick-up at the designated store location. If an order designated for "Pro Pick-Up" or "Pro Pick-Up within one hour" is not picked-up from the designated store location within three (3) business days from the date of availability provided at the time of confirmation, Ferguson reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without further notice to You, to cancel the order and return the product(s) to inventory. If Ferguson cancels the order, We will issue a credit by the charged payment method for the amount of the charge (less any restocking fee that may apply), or by an alternate method in Our sole discretion.

You agree to indemnify and hold Ferguson, its employees, officers, directors, investors, agents, assignees, affiliates, partners, subsidiaries, contractors, attorneys, accountants, advertisers, and any and all other individuals and organizations providing services on behalf of Ferguson harmless from all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and direct, incidental, consequential, exemplary and indirect damages) arising out of, resulting from or relating to Your use of the Website, Your breach or alleged breach of these Terms, or Your violation of any rights of another user.
