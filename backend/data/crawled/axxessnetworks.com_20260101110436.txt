In a time where technical support can often be frustrating and time-consuming (Especially Remote Support!), Tommy stands out as a beacon of exemplary service and I wanted to ensure that his efforts do not go unnoticed. We worked on this project for an extended period, and he diligently addressed every obstacle we encountered . His patience and consistent communication kept me well informed of the project’s status throughout . I am very pleased with his ability to resolve the issues, allowing us to successfully conclude this project. Jacob Lambert Virtually Seamless “I will definitely be recommending Axxess to my friends and colleagues. The transition this morning was virtually seamless and painless, and the web-based training was quick and easily understandable. The phones are gorgeous and sleek, and easy to maneuver” Robbin Swain Great Staff “We are a new customer of Axxess and we just recently had your phones installed in our store.
