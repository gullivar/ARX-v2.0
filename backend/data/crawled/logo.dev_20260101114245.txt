WAY better to add logos for our company avatars instead of the tacky initials you see everywhere. It was so easy to add. SL SUKUI LIU @ sukuiliu Honestly, I used Clearbit extensively when developing my own products, and when their logo API got shut down, it was genuinely frustrating—it really disrupts a developer's workflow when a foundational service suddenly disappears. Super glad to see you stepping up! Your API design is very intuitive, and the loading speed is excellent. Keep up the great work, looking forward to your future updates! KL Kyle Ledbetter @ kyleledbetter Super easy developer experience, straightforward APIs, and nice to have options to use as inline html img tag. 

Lots of features too, like dark mode and theme support, retina, size, grayscale.

Also the team is great with feedback and feature requests. RH Ryan Hoover @ ryanhoover Oooo, this could be useful for something we're building :) S Santhiaroo @ santhiaroo I have been experimenting with Logo.dev and even integrated it into my new product. The sign-up process is a magical experience that users love when they test my app. The free plan alone is more than sufficient. I've now made it a rule to integrate Logo.dev into all my apps. SK Steven Kovar @ stevenkovar It just works. I was going to build this app for myself and Logo.dev works so well I almost forgot I was using it. What a luxury to not have to download and edit logos anymore. KB Keith Brisson @ keithbrisson Excellent replacement for the Clearbit logo API and migrating took 15 minutes. MA Moe Amaya @ moeamaya Really big fan at Operate. When you released the dark mode prop, it eliminated an entire project from our roadmap! PF Phil Freo @ philfreo We've been using Logo.dev for over a year now to power company logos in Close CRM and it's been great. Simple, high quality, works well. PJ Philip Johnson @ philipjohnson Logo.dev is easily the best solution out there with a killer team to boot. If you're looking for an alternative look no further. DG Dan G @ dang We’ve been using Logo.dev for probably a year at ShiftControl! It’s a simple to use service that just works. I also like their logo and company search, which is easy to embed into your own site. Retina logos, png/jpg, various sizes and even some other useful options like fallback to initials of the company name.  If you need company logos on your site, this is the way. RW Richard Westermann @ richardwesterma Great product & very easy to set up (the developer experience was simple!). I used this across Web, Android/iOS applications and Chrome Extension in my stack with zero issues. Truly one of the best logo platforms out there.
