Ignite your spark

As a world-leading research institution, the University of Rochester is where curiosity and creativity connect to spark wonder in us all. From humanities to health care, business to education, and music to engineering, we advance ideas across disciplines to make our lives, and the future, ever better.

I chose the University of Rochester because of its open curriculum that fosters academic exploration, making it easy to pursue different departments. The University’s smaller size and integrated Medical Center also allows me to prioritize strong personal connections and my academic goals!
