have determined to be noteworthy, both living and dead. Superficially, it seems much like a
"Who's Who" where a noted person's curriculum vitae is available (the usual information 
such as date of birth, a biography, and other essential facts.) But it mostly exists to document the connections between people, many of which are not always
obvious. A person's otherwise inexplicable behavior is often understood by examining
the crowd that person has been associating with. Recent Deaths: 2019 · 2020 · 2021 About NNDB | weather.baby
