It’s a one-step, no-nonsense, time-saving masterpiece. —Karen Leinaar, Athletic Director Arbiter enables us to fill assignments much more quickly and efficiently and even provides us a way to reuse or share officials across multiple leagues within the organization. —Gavin Orr, Director of Sport If you’re looking to work smarter and not harder, save time and money, and move your athletic department forward – this is the company that can help you do it. —William Grove, Athletic Director With Alaska’s enormous geographic footprint, it would be impossible to oversee all of our schools without the help of powerful technology. Thanks to Arbiter, Alaska just got a little smaller. —Billy Strickland, Executive Director The reporting function has been invaluable for audits and budgeting.

We had 100% sign-ups by our deadline, a week before tryouts! —Michael Roy, Athletic Director Arbiter Registration streamlines so many different operations within a school and a district that it’s nearly impossible to think how we existed before it was implemented. That’s when you know a product is really great. When you look back and can’t for the life of you even imagine how we operated without it. —Keith Veltre, Supervisor of Athletics, Health Helps us maintain our athletic records in a safe, secure and efficient process that makes the job easier for parents and staff.
