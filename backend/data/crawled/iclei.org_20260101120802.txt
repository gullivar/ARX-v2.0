Our network FEATURED MEMBER Malmö, Sweden Malmö, in the southernmost province of Scania, is Sweden’s third-largest city and has been an ICLEI Member since 1998. It was the first city in Sweden to publicly commit to implementing the SDGs, integrating all goals into its governance and management systems. Under the leadership of Mayor Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, who serves as ICLEI President, the city launched the Malmö Commitment together with ICLEI, embedding social equity at the core of all sustainability policies—aligning climate, nature, and circular policies around inclusion and justice—and has empowered another 20 cities to join them in the journey. More FEATURED LEADER Piia Elo, Mayor of Turku, Finland Mayor Elo has served on Turku’s City Council since 2008 and previously as Deputy Mayor, focusing on education, youth services, and employment.

Mayor Elo serves as the ICLEI GexCom Regional Seat for Europe and advisor to the Circular Development Portfolio, complementing her role as member of the ICLEI Europe RexCom.
