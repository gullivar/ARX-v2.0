Powering your favorite frameworks and tools Loved by the community Don't take our word for it - listen to what Vite community members have to say. Ryan Carniato @RyanCarniato I'm loving what Vite enables. We've found building SolidStart that it is less a metaframework but a system of symbiotic Vite plugins. While built with
SolidJS in mind, they should scale from our simplest template to opinionated starter. We're building an ecosystem on Vite. Rich Harris @Rich_Harris Vite is basically the united nations of JavaScript at this point. I'll be there as a representative of Sveltelandia David East @_davideast Each and every time I use Vite, I feel a true sense of pure and unbridled joy. Mark Dalgleish @markdalgleish It’s also a great platform to build a framework on since it provides a pluggable dev environment. Community is amazing too. Jason Miller @_developit Every time I suspect I've hit the bounds of what Vite can do, I end up being wrong. David Cramer @zeeg Vite has been a game changer for the industry. Dion Almaer @dalmaer I am so excited to see so many great frameworks teaming up on top of vite. So many will benefit. ❤️ to the vite team.
