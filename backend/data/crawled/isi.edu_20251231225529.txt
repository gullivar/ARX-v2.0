Alongside fellow Vice Presidents Nils Aschenbruck, Andrew Seely and Dr. Cyril Onwubiko, Charles Hansen and Edward Au, Terry contributed to a comprehensive review of what the IEEE Computer Society describes as "one of its most active years in nearly 80 years of history." The reflection piece examines the remarkable programs and activities that defined 2025 while charting an ambitious course toward the Society's 80th anniversary. Terry's inclusion in this distinguished leadership group underscores her significant contributions to advancing computer science and cybersecurity research on a global scale. The full reflection article is available in the December issue of IEEE Computer Magazine, offering insights into the initiatives and innovations that have positioned the IEEE Computer Society at the forefront of the computing field. Congratulations, Terry, on this well-deserved recognition of your leadership and impact! View full post USC Information Sciences Institute December 15 Breakthrough in photonic computing! Scientists at USC Information Sciences Institute and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed the first regenerative photonic memory on a commercial foundry platform, solving a critical bottleneck in light-based computing. The challenge: As AI and data center demands surge, traditional electronic systems are hitting hard limits. Metal wires can only move data so fast before resistance and heat become barriers. Light-based computing promises dramatically faster speeds, but we've lacked one crucial component: memory that operates entirely in the optical domain. The innovation: Our team, led by Director of Advanced Electronics Ajey Jacob and UW-Madison Professor Akhilesh R Jaiswal, created a "photonic latch", an optical memory cell that stores data as light, just like standard RAM but faster. What makes this significant? It was built using GlobalFoundries ' Fotonix™ platform, meaning it's ready for commercial-scale manufacturing today. Impact: This technology could enable optical processor caches running 50-60 GHz—up to 20x faster than today's electronic caches—ideal for data centers and high-performance computing. Presented at IEEE IEDM Conference 2025, December 6-10 in San Francisco.
