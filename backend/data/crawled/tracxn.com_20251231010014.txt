Well-researched and insightful reports
I appreciate the value of Tracxn's search feature, which allows me to easily find new prospective businesses by sectors, geographies, and teams. The well-researched and insightful reports provided by Tracxn greatly aid my research efforts
Harsh Misra
Corporate Marketing Engineer, Siemens
A great tool for streamlined decision-making
Tracxn has been immensely valuable in our research, enabling quick understanding of tech sectors and drastically reducing our research time. Thanks to the proprietary Tracxn scores, we pinpoint the expanding sectors and efficiently screen companies of interest. It's a great tool for streamlined decision-making.
Koki Takahashi

Tracxn is my go-to tool because of the ease of using the platform
We have a subscription to multiple deal intelligence tools, but Tracxn is my go-to tool because of the ease of using the platform and looking at various cuts of the data. Shout out to the customer support team as well who are highly responsive.

Tracxn has been invaluable to our organisation
Tracxn's extensive company database, along with their insightful industry and company reports, has been invaluable to our organization. Their prompt and supportive customer service has enhanced our overall experience. Leveraging Tracxn's database, we successfully connected with relevant emerging companies in the Asia Pacific region, allowing us to address their cybersecurity requirements and help shape their code to cloud security readiness for not just their present needs, but also prepare them for their evolving future needs as they scale up through a complex cyber threat environment requiring fast, efficient, and scalable zero trust architecture.
Puneet Butan
Director, Business Strategy and operations, Palo Alto Network
The product is world-class and the customer service is excellent
Tracxn is an invaluable source for research in private markets incl. the technology sector. The product is world-class and the customer service is excellent and I am saying this while comparing vs. far more expensive resources built for public markets data. I hope the team expands its product suite and I wish them the very best.
Rajinder Balaraman
Managing Director, Z47 (fka Matrix Partners India Advisors LLP)
Scout and make near real-time decisions with API updates
Leveraging the Tracxn platform, we efficiently scout emerging market companies and make near real-time decisions with API updates. Practically, this reduces our need for traditional on-site scouting of startups and allow us to operate on a more global scale

Powerful taxonomy and dashboard setup help us track trends
As an investor at Dallas Venture Capital, using Tracxn has been a game-changer for us. The platform's simplicity and ease of use make it effortless to analyse company data and spot potential investment opportunities. The powerful taxonomy and dashboard setup help us track trends and stay up-to-date with companies making significant strides. The platform's ease of use and simplicity have made our work more efficient, and I highly recommend it!
