EXPERIMENTAL
Marty Supreme (Original Soundtrack)
Daniel Lopatin
BEST NEW ALBUM
The electronic composer meets the larger-than-life film on its level, building the palette he’s honed over the years into a totalizing prism of sound.
By Sam Goldner
ELECTRONIC
Implosion
The Bug / Ghost Dubs
The dub veterans bring out the best in each other with a collaborative album that balances lumbering doom with spacey ambience.
By Andrew Ryce
RAP
Soulja Hate Repellant
Niontay
One of MIKE’s roster of rap mavericks, Niontay probes the deepest, murkiest corners of his sound on this 454-hosted mixtape, blurring his influences and slurring his bars with abandon.
By Benny Sun
FOLK/COUNTRY
Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares
Bulgarian State Radio & Television Female Vocal Choir
Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we look back on a collection of Communist-era Bulgarian folk recordings that became an unlikely hit for 4AD in the 1980s.

EXPERIMENTAL
Tranquilizer
Oneohtrix Point Never
BEST NEW ALBUM
Drawing on a cache of commercial sample CDs, Daniel Lopatin assembles an impossibly dense and transportive electronic album that takes impermanence as its inspiration.
POP/R&B
Addison
Addison Rae
The girlypop album of summer warrants comparison to Lana, Madonna, and most of all, Britney. Are we ready for Addison?
ROCK
Snocaps
Snocaps
The Crutchfield twins—accompanied by MJ Lenderman and Brad Cook—reunite for a spirited new project that plays to their strengths and embraces all the miles they’ve traveled.
POP/R&B
LUX
Rosalía
BEST NEW ALBUM
The Spanish singer’s fourth record is a heartfelt offering of avant-garde classical pop that roars through genre, romance, and religion.
RAP
Stardust
Danny Brown
Working with a new vanguard of outsider electronic artists, the Detroit rapper lets his freak flag fry. The results are shaky but full of heart.
POP/R&B
West End Girl
Lily Allen
With an album that doubles as an insider’s account of a tabloid divorce, the singer finds a new evolution of her signature style: Lightness isn’t a foil for irony, but a vehicle for hurt.
RAP
Lil Herb
G Herbo
Stepping into his teenage shoes for a loose concept album, the Chicago icon reflects on the original era of drill with the clarity of a scene veteran.
ELECTRONIC
Repulsor
Shlohmo
The L.A. beatmaker turns aggressive on his fourth album—dialing up the distortion, flooding his beats with overdriven synths, and pushing anxious moods into the red.
