Luxer One has been a godsend! Package management today is so different from how it used to be. You absolutely need a package management solution, and for us, Luxer One has been the holy grail. I could never imagine going back.
Dina S.
Property Manager @ Mirabella Apartments
I love Luxer, it is so convenient to get emails to inform you that your package is there, and so easy to type your pas number in to open the lockers to retrieve your package. I wish all my mail was delivered this way, it would save me a ton of trips to the mailbox unnecessarily.

I've been with the Postal Service for 16 years and these lockers are a game changer. They keep all the packages safe and sound.
Gerardo S.
Delivery Carrier @ USPS
Luxer One has made our lives a lot easier for the office staff and the residents. When we take people on tour of the property, Luxer One is another wow factor. I don’t think we could ever go back to not having Luxer One lockers.
Jose Soto
Resident Manager @ Portofino Apartment Homes
Luxer One is part of our core group of amenities all our communities need to have. Their forward-thinking nature and dedication to their customers is what sets them apart.
Steve Hallsey
EVP of Operations @ Wood Partners
Luxer One’s package solutions have taken a previous problem and turned them into a value adding solution. Once we started installing Luxer’s lockers and everyone saw how much of a game changer they were, I have had property managers regularly calling me asking when they can have one installed on their site.
Luke Champion
Asset Manager @ Horizon Realty Advisors
The smart lockers provide secure and convenient 24/7 access to our dealers and business services community.
Tracy
Chief of Customer Service Operations @ Lee County Tax Collectors
