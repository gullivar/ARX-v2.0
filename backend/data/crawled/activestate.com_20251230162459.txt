What our clients say
ActiveState is in a good position. You're already well down the SLSA route and I think that's extremely important as more and more of the SSDF will come into the attestation.
ActiveState User
Global DevOps Lead, Software industry
I don't have to think too much about security and the complications anymore because ActiveState does it for me.
Stacy Leon
Sr. Technical Specialist, Altair
In a place where you don't have this infrastructure set up, [ActiveState] is turnkey and a no brainer. Other build environments are garbage next to yours!
ActiveState User
Application Support Engineer, Data & Governance industry
ActiveState is so seamless that the business can function even with turnover and little training. The lights stay on and the engineers don't have to worry about what languages they are using to add value.
