Frequently Asked Questions
What is an antidetect browser?

An antidetect browser (also called anti fingerprint browser) is an anonymous browser designed to minimize the ability of websites and tracking systems to identify and track your digital fingerprint. These undetected browsers employ various techniques to mask or alter browser fingerprints. After fingerprint spoofing, you can act like a real person to make it difficult for websites or online platforms to identify and keep your multiple accounts secure.

What is AdsPower used for?

AdsPower antidetect browser allows you to create multiple profiles with unique browser fingerprints based on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Taking it a notch higher, each profile is fully customizable, allowing you to adjust its IP, language, resolution, timezone, cookies, geolocation, fonts, proxy, DNS, Canvas, WebGL, WebGPU, IndexedDB, etc. That makes it difficult for websites or online services to associate a user's browsing activity with their true identity or previous online behavior.

What IP proxies are supported?

AdsPower works with all popular proxy protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, Socks5, SSH) and IPv4/IPv6 addresses. We don't offer built-in proxies, but seamlessly integrate with a wide range of providers like Bright Data, Oxylabs, and more.




Why does AdsPower stand out?

We prioritize user privacy, collecting minimal data and encrypting everything for ultimate security. Our optional encrypted cloud storage lets you share data securely and automate tasks across devices.
