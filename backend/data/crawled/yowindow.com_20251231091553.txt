ATTENTION YoWindow for Windows and Mac will not work in 2021 The desktop version of YoWindow was made with Flash technology by Adobe back in 2009. 
Unfortunately, since 1 Jan 2021 Flash is no longer supposed to work. YoWindow for Windows and Mac is not able to function without Flash. If you uninstall Flash from your computer, YoWindow will not be able to work. We are sorry. Unfortunately, the situation is beyond our control. Anyway, right now we are working on new YoWindow version that will not depend on Flash. 
We hope to release the new version in 2024. 
If you own YoWindow license key it will unlock the new version. 
For the time being you are welcome to run YoWindow on iOS or YoWindow on Android. 4.8 ★★★★★ 4.6 ★★★★★ 4.9 ★★★★★ Turn any picture into landscape Landscape Collection Plug your Weather Station (PWS) Subscribe to YoWindow newsletter! @YoWindow YoWindow on press and TV Contact us © 2022 - 2025 Weather View LLC.
