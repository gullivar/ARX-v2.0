Interface the bigger QSFP form factor with older SFP28, SFP+ equipment


In this example you will see 3 different ways how you could connect your 100G capable QSFP28 device with an older SFP+ device. The same advice generally applies to all QSFP/QSFP+/QSFP28/QSFP56 that need to be connected to SFP28, SFP+ and even regular SFP, but the exact conversion capabilities are determined by the specification of the interface modules that are used.
