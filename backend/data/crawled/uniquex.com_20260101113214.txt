Unique X's innovative  market leading solutions power ODEON cinemas across the UK and the rest of Europe, supporting our ambition for technology driven automation and superlative customer experiences. Unique X's solutions has allowed ODEON to centralise our sound and projection operations and reach a near perfect level of successful feature and pre-show exhibition." Mike Bradbury - Group Head of Sound & Projection ODEON SERVICES INCLUDED "In 2024, Cinemex was still managing its theatres with labour-intensive and manual processes at each location. Partnering with Unique X opened a new world of possibilities for us. With their support, we successfully transitioned nearly 3,000 screens to RosettaBridge TMS from our previous vendor in just six weeks. This implementation enabled full circuit management through RosettaNet and introduced Smart Trailing and Advertising Accord, allowing us to fully automate our pre-show operations." Javier Ezquerro - Innovation IT Director, Cinemex SERVICES INCLUDED READ CASE STUDY "For the last 15 years, Advertising Accord has played a significant role in facilitating the smooth operation of cinema advertising in the UK. From enhanced sales, inventory management, playlist creation, finance, and reconciliation, the system has helped make cinema advertising efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. A key factor in this success has been our partnership with Unique X, whose ongoing platform development has contributed to making the UK one of the most advanced and flexible cinema advertising markets in the world, which in turn has supported significant revenue growth for DCM."
