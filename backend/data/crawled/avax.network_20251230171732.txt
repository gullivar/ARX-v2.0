coming together to form one unified
ecosystem.

WHY
AVALANCHE

01

FAST. POWERFUL. SECURE.

The groundbreaking Avalanche consensus powers a network of fast, efficient, highly-optimized chains that finalize transactions almost instantly. Accompanied by a best-in-class developer experience and suite of tools, Avalanche is the platform of choice for builders and users ready for what’s next in Web3.

02

INFINITELY SCALABLE BY DESIGN

Avalanche is where Web3's big ideas scale with confidence. Whether it’s a single application, or launching a fully-customizable Layer 1 blockchain, Avalanche makes it easy to scale up — or across — in an interconnected ecosystem.

03

CUSTOMIZABLE LAYER 1S

Whatever your use-case, Avalanche makes launching your own L1 more economically feasible, simpler to customize, smoother to maintain and quicker to bring to market. The network is anchored by a lightning-fast and efficient primary chain and a universe of sovereign blockchains, all natively connected through Avalanche Interchain Messaging.

04

GLOBAL COMMUNITY

Avalanche is more than just a blockchain network. It's a global community of builders, creators, and collaborators, all together on a mission to drive the adoption of blockchain technology. There are no gatekeepers, just an open ecosystem where knowledge and resources are shared, creating a global movement ready to turn ideas into real-world impact.
