With gravatar or similar A good use-case would be using it as a fallback for Gravatar. Example: https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ EMAIL_MD5 ? d = https%3A%2F%2Fui-avatars.com%2Fapi%2F/Lasse+Rafn/128 Because of limitations in Gravatar, we must pass in the parameters as sub-directories, instead of query-parameters. You should also consider urlencoding the name, in case it contains special characters. It's a
		limitation by Gravatar, not UI Avatars. The order is as follows: name size background color length font-size rounded uppercase bold format Retina I recommend using 1.5x or 2x sizes for your avatars, but keeping the img tag the original size, to ensure crisp avatars on high DPI screens. Language/Script support I have added support for some unicode scripts/languages that are not supported by the typical fonts. Current support: Arabic Armenian Bengali Georgian Hebrew Chinese Japanese Mongolian Thai Tibetan Wordpress plugin It has Wordpress plugin!
