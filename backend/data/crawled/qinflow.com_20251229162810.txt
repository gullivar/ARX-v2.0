I would like to say we our very happy with our purchase of the Warrior Lite system. You have a great product. I have used several warmers in the prehospital world during my time as a flight nurse, and the Warrior Lite by far supersedes the quality of what I have used in the past.

We've been able to use the Warrior on a few occasions. So far, fantastic response!

We are having amazing success and save cases this past year [2020]. Just last week we infused a unit of WARMED LTOWB in 2 min [250ml/min]. The patient received 3 on-the-ground and 2 in flight and survived a non-survivable GSW [gunshot wound] to the chest!

I have never seen any portable blood and IV fluid warmer that approximates the performance of the Warrior... The warming range, warming speed, flow rates and battery capacity are outstanding... Well done!

We had a multiple gunshot wound patient on Saturday with a blood pressure in the 60s. Got whole blood via the Warrior with a hand off to Life Flight and their Warrior worked great - hand off was seamless.
