Ben Curtis To: Jason Charnes Subject: Re: Uploading logs Happy to help! And thanks for letting me know it (mostly) worked. I guess I have some debugging to do on that environment variable. :) One last thing... make sure you run this to get Vector to start after a reboot: sudo systemctl enable vector.service I put that in the gist after I sent the last email to you, so you may have done that already, but you may not have, and it doesn't hurt to do it twice. :) Oh, and about the log prefix you mentioned... look in config/environments/production.rb for config.log_tags and comment that out. That's probably what's adding that stuff to your logs. Jason Charnes To: Honeybadger Support Subject: Re: Uploading logs That did the trick!! This is so awesome. Again, thank you!
