I recently installed the Getscreen.me Google Chrome extension, and it has been a game-changer for my remote support tasks. The extension is incredibly easy to set up and use, allowing me to connect to clients' devices directly from my browser without any hassle. The connection is stable and the interface is user-friendly, making it simple to navigate and manage multiple sessions simultaneously. I appreciate how it seamlessly integrates with my existing workflows, saving me time and effort. Overall, I highly recommend the Getscreen.me Chrome extension for anyone needing reliable and efficient remote access!

I love getscreen.me for the quick possibility to connect to an installed agent via a web browser - the rendering of graphical UI is faster then for example a remote desktop solution of other brands.

I am beginning to use this more and more every day as I become used to just open the app or browser and connect to a screen. As I only have to install one agent to use it, its easy to integrate and it supports Windows and mac.there doesnt seem to be any way of accessing alpha or beta builds. however as I could contact support i think they would be easily able to help me fix this as well.

The Uiser interface and easiness of implementation is also is a great point. I love the easy to use features of the UI in case of file transfers - something which is super intuitive and useful as well as really easy to use. great product all in all!
