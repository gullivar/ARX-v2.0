The Venezuela Escalation Ignores a Long History of U.S. Hypocrisy on Drugs
BY ERIC ROSS

Every accusation is a confession. This is clearly true of the Trump administration’s insistence that Venezuela operates as a “narco-state,” exporting terrorism to the U.S. via fentanyl, now labeled as a “weapon of mass destruction.” The charge is not only false, given that virtually no fentanyl enters the country from Venezuela, but transparently political and pretextual.

America’s Loss of Science and Loss of Virtue
BY ROBERT HUNZIKER

The Trump administration has issued a death warrant for science. This kills one of America’s greatest most productive avenues to GDP growth. Simple-minded people are determining the future course of the country. After all, science is foundational to America’s economy. More

Antiracism in the Age of Trump
BY JOSHUA SPERBER

We are today living in an era of historically ferocious political regression, a massive conservative backlash whose grievances are often more imagined than real. In no case is this more dramatic than race. Notwithstanding the fact that Nick Fuentes is preaching white victimhood to millions, the Coast Guard has declassified nooses and swastikas as hate symbols, and the Supreme Court has eliminated voting rights protections and affirmative action, African Americans continue to be discriminated against. Indeed, for all of the problems with the New York Times’ 1619 Project, it did show the ways in which structural racism continues to shape the US from healthcare to the labor market to criminal justice to traffic. Nevertheless, today’s anti-woke backlash is so ubiquitous that even some liberals have accepted its premise that in the movement against racism the pendulum has swung too far.  More

Gaza as the Last Moral Frontier against Israel’s Policy of Annihilation
BY RAMZY BAROUD

Three dominant narratives contend for the future of Gaza and occupied Palestine, yet only one is being translated into consequential action: the Israeli narrative of domination and genocide. This singular, violent vision is the only one backed by the brute force of policy and fact. More
