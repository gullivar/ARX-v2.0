Our Higher Purpose
Another way we pursue greatness

WPX really loves dogs! That's why we work to hugely impact the lives of shelter, homeless, and disabled dogs (and some cats) in Eastern Europe. We founded "Every Dog Matters" nonprofit foundation through which we aim not only to fight but entirely eliminate the problem.
