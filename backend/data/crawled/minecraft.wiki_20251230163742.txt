About the game

Minecraft is a 3D sandbox adventure game developed by Mojang Studios, where players can interact with a fully customizable three-dimensional world made of blocks and entities. Its diverse gameplay options allow players to choose the way they play, creating infinite possibilities.

There are three actively maintained editions of Minecraft: Java Edition (Windows, macOS, Linux); Bedrock Edition (Windows, mobile, and consoles); and Minecraft Education (for educational settings). There is also a localized release of the game for mainland China, referred to as China Edition.

Featured article

A copper golem is a buildable passive mob that sorts items from copper chests into wooden chests based on the items already in the chest. Over time, if not waxed, a copper golem will oxidize, eventually becoming a copper golem statue shortly after reaching full oxidation. They can be built using a block of copper and a carved pumpkin, and are created alongside a copper chest, both of which will match the oxidation state of the block of copper used to create them.
