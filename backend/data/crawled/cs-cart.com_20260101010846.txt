Pritish A. eCom Specialist In terms of functionality, it is very feature-rich, and it can be rather overwhelming in terms of doing the initial setup, especially if you do not have a technical background, which like I said I do not.

Contractor There are detailed manuals and video instructions, not only for beginners, a large forum and active community, developers, marketplace, and a good help desk. Milan P.

They enable me to get a good night's rest knowing my server is working just how it should! Roland Manager FAQ What is marketplace software? Marketplace software is a platform for starting a multi-vendor website. This software can be on-premise or cloud. On-premise marketplace platforms usually have a lifetime license with one-time payment. Cloud platforms are subscription-based. How does marketplace software work? Marketplace software has a backend, a storefront, and a vendor panel. An admin manages the marketplace in the admin panel: manages sellers, helps them upload products, set up promotions, payment options, and logistics. Customers shop on the marketplace storefront by browsing the catalog and adding products to the cart from different sellers. Once the order is placed, a marketplace seller sees it in the vendor panel and starts to process it. What are some examples of e-commerce marketplaces? The most known eCommerce marketplace is Amazon. It's a marketplace with a long history. It's the biggest marketplace in the world. eBay is another example of an all-in-one marketplace. Etsy is a marketplace for handmade products. See more examples of online marketplaces in our Customers section . How do I start an eCommerce marketplace? You basically have two options: develop an eCommerce marketplace platform from scratch or build a marketplace on a ready-made platform. There are pros and cons of both options. For example, the development of an eCommerce marketplace from scratch can cost you a lot of money. But in this case, you can tailor it perfectly to your business processes. Building the business on a ready platform is way more affordable and quicker but you can face some limitations, which you will have to overcome with custom development. What hosting service should I use for my CS-Cart store? Scalesta is the hosting service recommended by CS-Cart. Their specialized solutions are tailored for CS-Cart marketplaces, ensuring optimal performance and security. Plus, CS-Cart clients can enjoy a complimentary trial month with servers pre-configured by Scalesta. Do I need a marketplace platform to sell online? You only need an eCommerce marketplace platform if you plan to cooperate with third-party sellers and sell a large number of products. If you don't want to work with sellers and want to sell only your own products, it is better to start a conventional online shop. How do I sell through multiple eCommerce platforms? There are two ways to sell through multiple channels. The first way is to start your own eCommerce marketplace or shop and export your products to other large marketplaces such as Amazon. This way, you will have the main sales channel (your marketplace) and auxiliary channels (Amazon, eBay, etc.). The second way is to start an online marketplace with multiple storefronts. You open many storefronts in different countries and for different products and audiences.
