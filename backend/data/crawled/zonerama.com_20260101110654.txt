How to Use Zonerama
 
Album sharing
Upload and share your photos

Share your albums, photos, or videos directly on social media. Or create links, give them expiration dates, and send them however you want—for example by email.

Privacy settings
Password-protect your albums

You can password-protect your albums and share your photos with only the people you want. You can also watermark your photos easily, protecting your intellectual property.
