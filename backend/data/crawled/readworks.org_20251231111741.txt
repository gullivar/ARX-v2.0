Heard from the ReadWorks Community
5th-graders learned that not everyone has access to clean water by studying the Flint Water Crisis (and my favorite activist @LittleMissFlint). We read “Mari Copeny Takes Action to Save Her City” from @ReadWorks.
Summer Wineteer, M.Ed
5TH GRADE TEACHER
ReadWorks has provided an essential resource for my students and teachers that allowed us access to high-quality, diverse texts and resources that we otherwise would not have had access to.
