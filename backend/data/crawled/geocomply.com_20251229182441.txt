Understand the risk of every online interaction

Fraudsters fake locations and tamper with devices. GeoComply spots and stops them with lightning-fast, advanced integrity checks. Now, you can trust your users are who and where they say they are, safeguarding your business from millions in potential fraud losses and non-compliance penalties.

On-property geofencing tailored for you

PinPoint combines proprietary beacon technology with our core geolocation compliance software to create custom virtual boundaries. Tell us what you need to geofence; PinPoint makes it happen.

Boost your chargeback win rate by up to 90%

When a customer claims they didn’t shop online or place a bet, our compelling evidence reports prove they did. In-depth evidence – a combination of device integrity and geolocation history – plus end-to-end chargeback management help you win disputes.

Identify location fraud with award-winning VPN and proxy detection

Geo-piracy and sanctions risks have one thing in common – they both involve IP address spoofing. GeoGuard is a continually updated IP database that detects and flags anonymizers such as VPNs, proxies, and Tor exit nodes. The result? Lower fraud and compliance risks.
