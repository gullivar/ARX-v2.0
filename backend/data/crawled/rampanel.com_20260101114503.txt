RAM DASHBOARDS PROVIDE ACTIONABLE DATA, STORIES FOR SALES PEOPLE AND KPI METRICS FOR MANAGEMENT
Campaign Effect

Read more

A Panorama chart summarises the campaign or the content measured in an easy to understand graphic output. The measured memory traces are divided in to 4 or 5 different categories. Red bars show values based on ad recall, yellow bars show brand recognition, blue bars show brand engagement, the green bar shows what action the measured piece provoked and finally when measuring content marketing, the purple bars show how the quality of the piece performs . It is possible to get questions on The Panaroma view broken down by more than 40 demographic target groups.

Key Performance Indicators

Read more

For each Campaign measured, an index, (Key Performance index, KPI) will be created to compare the ad’s effectiveness to RAM’s complete database of similar ads in the same channels. The KPI can also be compared to the customers own reference data. These indexes are a perfect starting point for sales reps to engage with the advertisers in order to prove worth and secure recurring business. Examples of the five best ads in the same indexed category are provided to visualise what can be improved in lower performing ads.

Return on Marketing Investment

Read more

Return of marketing investment (ROMI) is a sales tool created to be used by sales reps and advertisers to calculate and understand the real impact that advertising plays in increasing advertiser sales. The ROMI calculator makes it easy to analyse both the break-even point for the advertisers campaigns but also to get the full financial performance of the ad campaign based on the effectiveness of the ad.
