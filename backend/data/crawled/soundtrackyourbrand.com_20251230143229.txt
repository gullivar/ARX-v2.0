Get legal

Personal music services such as Spotify are not approved to use in any business environment. You need to use a suitable music provider and have the correct licenses in place to avoid legal concerns.
Soundtrack is a game changer: made to bring you music that's legal for your business, without compromising on quality. Simply add public performance licenses from your local collecting societies.

An absolutely wonderful platform giving you absolute control. Does what it’s supposed to do, takes the heavy lifting out of putting your music together but gives you the flexibility to be able to put your own personal stamp on your playlists. Absolutely blown away.
