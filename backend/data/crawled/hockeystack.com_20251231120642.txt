We’ll stay close to keep adoption seamless. Book a demo Frequently asked questions What kind of onboarding and support can we expect for successful GTM AI adoption? Our implementation is self serve, and onboarding is designed to be quick and streamline your path to value.  Our customers get initial GTM insights within 24 hours. Our dedicated customer success team provides high-quality support and resources to ensure smooth AI adoption and help you effectively integrate our AI agents into your existing GTM strategies. Why should I trust HockeyStack AI agents? AI agents are only as good as the data they’re trained on. Without access to accurate, well-organized, and contextual information about your business, they produce outputs that are often irrelevant or unreliable. ‍ HockeyStack connects directly to your GTM tech stack, ingesting both structured and unstructured data across marketing, sales, product, and customer success. We clean, organize, and categorize this data to ensure your AI agents are grounded in accurate, up-to-date information. ‍ You also have the ability to customize and edit the context your AI agents operate in, ensuring they understand your business as deeply as you and your team do. ‍ Over time, HockeyStack AI Agents continuously learn from your company’s real activities, strategies, and decisions, automatically refining their recommendations and actions. ‍ The result is trustworthy, business-aware outputs that drive meaningful results from day one, and only improve over time. Do I need technical knowledge to implement HockeyStack? While having a GTM or revenue operations resource can help streamline implementation, HockeyStack is built as a fully self-serve GTM AI platform and doesn’t require any coding. Our AI agents, Odin and Nova , make it easy to analyze touchpoint data and surface next best actions—no technical knowledge needed. What other GTM tools do you integrate with? HockeyStack integrates with leading CRM, ABM, Marketing Automation, Sales Outreach, and advertising platforms. Learn more about our integrations. What is cookieless tracking and how does it work?
