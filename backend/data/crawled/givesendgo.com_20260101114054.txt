Why Choose Us
We Love Freedom

Even if we do not agree with you, we will defend your right to fundraise for the causes and people you love.

We Love To Give Back

Each month, GiveSendGo designates some of our operational expenses to 'Give Back' to active campaigns on our site. We love being Givers!

We Love to Pray

We're the only crowdfunding site with a 'Pray' button, and our prayer team will personally call you to let you know that we are praying for you.

About GiveSendGo

In 2014, three siblings had an idea. What would it look like if we took the newly popular idea of crowdfunding and stretched it beyond just funding help for people's material needs but also providing hope for people's spiritual needs? Out of those discussions, GiveSendGo was born. After over a year of development and setbacks, GiveSendGo was launched with a beta version in early 2015.
