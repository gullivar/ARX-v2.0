Customer love Trusted By the Best Security Teams In The Fortune 1000 and G2000 Obsidian not only gives us centralized visibility but also provides insights into key areas that we simply don’t have without it. They became the obvious choice for us because of the depth in context and insights they provide across all critical areas of our SaaS ecosystem. We have a strong culture of security within Snowflake, and Obsidian helps us take that further. Unlike other vendors we have reviewed, Obsidian is thorough. It gives us visibility into key areas such as third-party integrations and posture settings that our other tools don’t cover. This allows us to make confident decisions about the 3rd party applications we should allow and deny. Obsidian didn’t just make us more secure. It also streamlined how we manage roles and access across our systems. While some third-party security companies offer posture management review services, Obsidian empowers our security team to self-serve and move with agility. Obsidian gives my team the best visibility, regardless of where the alert’s coming from. We’ve saved an absolute ton of people hours through automation and data pulled from Obsidian. Obsidian has revolutionized our incident response and are providing a lot of value. Find me something else that is this plug and play and is not going to nickel and dime you over a large period of time. A spear phishing email was sent to the inboxes of our sister company. It bypassed their email security completely undetected. But as soon as a user clicked on the link, we got an alert from Obsidian. Within minutes, the team was able to quarantine those emails and block the websites.
