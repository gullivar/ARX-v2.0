Welcome to Auctollo; we build SEO tools that help you optimize your website’s performance and improve your search engine rankings. We are proud to have contributed to the WordPress community for decades!

Our flagship product, XML Sitemap Generator, is a powerful sitemap generator that makes it easy to create and submit sitemaps to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. But that’s not all we have to offer. In addition to XML Sitemap Generator, we have a range of other SEO tools planned that will help you troubleshoot indexation issues, optimize your sitemap for maximum indexation, and gain valuable insights into your website’s performance.

Current Products

Our sitemap generator tool (XML Sitemap Generator), is designed to simplify creating and submitting sitemaps to search engines. With just a few clicks, you can generate a comprehensive sitemap that includes all your website’s pages, including dynamic and static pages, blog posts, categories, and tags. Our tool automatically updates your sitemap whenever you add, change or delete content, so you never have to worry about outdated or missing information. The generator can also follow business logic to set priorities based on the number of comments or other criteria.

Our tool supports all major search engines and provides detailed instructions on submitting your sitemap to each one. By submitting your sitemap, you can improve your website’s visibility and increase the likelihood of your pages being indexed and ranked in search results.
