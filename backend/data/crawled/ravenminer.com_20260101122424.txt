With this method, the pool pays miners for each valid block found. Miners get paid proportionally for their effort. PPS+ Mining Mode (optional) With PPS method, the pool pays miners for each submitted share. PPS+ mode adds in addition to regular PPS payouts a little more coins when a block is found. Transaction fees we receive with each block are shared between PPS and PPLNS miners making PPS+ even more profitable. Solo Mining Mode With this method, you can mine alone, without other pool users. This method is not recommended for small to medium miners due the long time to find a block and high dependency on luck. You can combine SOLO mode and autoexchange!
