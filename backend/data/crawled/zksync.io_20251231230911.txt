Our team works alongside enterprises to shape use cases, integrate infrastructure, and deploy production-ready solutions. From strategy and compliance alignment to launch and scale, we help ensure your blockchain initiative succeeds from day one. Talk to an expert At Memento, we're dedicated to transitioning traditional finance on-chain. Our work with Deutsche Bank on a ZK Chain based platform simplifies and accelerates asset tokenization and fund management reducing complexity and costs while ensuring compliance and privacy for the financial products. Nicole Lanteri CEO at Memento At Tradable, we empower institutional asset managers to transition on-chain. By leveraging ZKsync's robust security, interoperability, and customization, we recently tokenized nearly $2 billion of alternative assets, enabling financial firms to seamlessly adopt web3 technology and broaden their investor base. Alex Cordover CEO at Tradable Abstract leverages the ZK Stack to deliver fast, low-cost, and secure consumer experiences on Ethereum—fueling its mission to build the world’s largest onchain community. Michael Lee Co-Inventor & CEO of Abstract We needed infrastructure that combines innovation with reliability to support long-term ecosystem growth. The ZK Stack delivers this balance, giving us confidence to scale globally with cryptographic integrity and flexibility. We believe ZKsync provides the secure and future-ready foundation on which XPLA can continue to evolve. Alfred Yun CTO ZKP is the future of EVM. Moreover, the Elastic Network offers a highly supportive environment with unique interoperability that will position Elastic chains for economies of scale. This is the perfect setup for Creator chain, which aspires to serve creators and their followers en masse. Rudy Lee Founder of Creator Chain We chose to partner with ZKsync because they share our belief that crypto must feel simple, safe, and familiar to end users.
