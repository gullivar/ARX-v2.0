GRANICUS IN ACTION
Innovating with technology

The City of Olathe set out to create a digital transformation, but instead, they got a more transparent, informed, and united city. With the Government Experience Cloud at the center, City of Olathe modernized government operations from top to bottom.

"Olathe's success can also be measured by its ability to continue evolving and adding to its experience, knowing everything will work seamlessly together."
Scott Meyer, Digital Programs Manager
Success story 
GRANICUS IN ACTION
Transforming engagement

King County Elections knew they wanted to increase Washington’s voter turnout, they just didn’t know how. Partnering with the Granicus Experience Group, we worked to increase transparency in the vote-by-mail process, which led to higher turnout in elections. 

"This feels like an exercise in radical transparency [leading to] greater turn out, greater cure rates, and more voices being heard.”
Jaclyn Adams, Project Manager
Success story 
GRANICUS IN ACTION
Serving critical communities

In the first two years of working with Granicus Experience Group (GXG), Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD increased subscribers by 275% and increased annual pledge support 400% during PTSD Awareness Month. 

“If it hadn’t been for the GXG partnership there would have been no way for us to know the difference in types of communications our audience wanted and needed."
Peggy Willoughby, Director of Communications
Success story 
GRANICUS IN ACTION
Connecting everyone

Coos Bay wanted a new website, but what they got what an integrated communication platform and engaged users. Through active listening, clients and staff participated in making their digital presence everything they needed. 

“I walked in the door saying, ‘Give me a new website, email, and meetings platform.’ And we got that!... You helped us reinvent what government looks like in our community.”
Nichole Rutherford, Assistant City Manager
