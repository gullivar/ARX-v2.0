About Ministry

For more than 150 years, the Department of Posts (DoP) has been the backbone of the country's communication and has played a crucial role in the country's social economic development. It touches the lives of Indian citizens in many ways: delivering mails, accepting deposits under Small Savings Schemes, providing life insurance cover under Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) and providing retail services like bill collection, sale of forms, etc.
