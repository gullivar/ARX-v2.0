Yes — keeping your files and data safe is a top priority for us. We’ve built in several layers of protection so you can use PDF Guru with confidence. We follow GDPR rules, which means your data is handled responsibly and only used with your permission. Your files are encrypted during upload using secure SSL connections, so no one can see what you're working on.
