We provide a large library of professional design templates for layouts and registration pages to ensure a fast launch.

How long does it take to set up an event using vFairs? The time it takes to set up an event using vFairs depends on the complexity and scope, but the platform is designed for efficiency and self-service. For Simple Events (Self-Serve Features): You can set up event registration pages, landing pages, and basic event structures in minutes using the drag-and-drop builder. For Comprehensive/Complex Events: For larger, fully branded events (especially with custom 3D virtual environments and complex agendas), 
                                vFairs recommends a minimum of four weeks for full setup. This includes event planning, custom design approval, content upload, and rehearsals. In short, while technical setup is fast due to self-serve tools, large-scale events require a few weeks of preparation and content gathering. Can I customize registration forms and ticketing? Yes. You can use our drag-and-drop tools to build highly custom registration forms, create multiple ticket types and pricing tiers,
