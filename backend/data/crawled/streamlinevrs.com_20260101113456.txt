Learn More About Streamline One Our Software Suite The vacation rental industry has grown leaps and bounds over the past couple of decades. More than ever, travelers have shifted away from hotels and into the family environment behind a vacation home. With more competition than ever in the vacation rental market, it is clear that a top-quality software solution is needed to compete and thrive. For almost two decades, Streamline has worked tirelessly to simplify the vacation rental management process. Our quality suite of programs has made it easier than ever before to manage a large volume of properties by providing property managers with every function they may need. As you’ll see, this is truly the all-in-one vacation rental software suite you have been looking for! Lead Management: Creating a quote and responding to a quote request can become your first impression to a client and is thus one of the most important parts of any v acation rental management software . With Streamline, a quote can be automatically generated within seconds by our system, or your sales agents can generate a personalized quote in under a minute. That means no more manually responding to leads, no more manual price calculation, and no more copy and pasting! Websites: For us and many others in the industry, website design is a constant study on what works to attract the demographic you target, and “what works” constantly changes. However, with Streamline, you can be secure in the knowledge that we have taken the extra step to stay ahead of the curve. From desktop computers, to tablets, to mobile responsive websites. Each one has unique visitors. Streamline hosts some of the top conversion-friendly vacation rental websites in the industry. Trust Accounting : This is a critical component of your company. That’s why Streamline provides the technology and the functionality with an industry-leading trust accounting suite. With the right technology in place, trust accounting and staying in compliance is much easier. Distribution Channels: It’s very important to diversify your portfolio and consider every possible booking source! To help you achieve that end, we integrate with the most powerful distribution channels in the industry to help generate as many bookings as possible. Booking.com, Airbnb, VRBO, HomeToGo, Hopper, and the list goes on and on. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Automate, distribute and increase bookings. Partners: We surround ourselves with innovation and utilize those partners who dedicate their technology to specific areas. Automated locks, distribution channels, full home management, yield management, electronic signatures, powerful marketing software like NAVIS, integrated email newsletter capability, and more. These are just some of the partners that we utilize to improve your vacation rental management company. Streamline now features 100+ Preferred Partners in their ecosystem. CRM: Everyone advertises that they provide a CRM . With our mobile apps and our powerful automated document system, you are able to build stronger relationships. Profiling guests for targeted marketing is extremely critical. As a property manager, a small investment in your most loyal customers will go a long way. Remember, repeat business will change your “stress level”. Document System: We have created a document system that is driven by triggers. These triggers are any relationship to a reservation, owner activity, housekeeping actions, maintenance activity. Once the trigger takes place, the document is sent out, automating the process so you can spend less time manually dealing with certain tasks. These are custom documents that are created dynamically and created by YOU for YOU. Days before check-in, days after check-out, lead management status and hours a reservation has been on hold are just a few documents you can create with our powerful system. The right trigger will go a long way. P.O.S.: Streamline also offers an advanced point of sale system, which allows you to keep inventory. Many clients use this feature for running their small shops or sales at their vacation rental offices. You can take in inventory to enable you to do average costing, create triggers to notify you when specific items need to be replenished, and even integrate this feature with your maintenance area to manage that critical light bulb inventory! Reporting Suite: Our extensive list of reports allow you to understand how your company is performing. And, while you are able to create your own custom reports, our reports will provide you with the information you need to understand your performance. Our revenue forecasting report allows you to see into the future for company and individual units, while pacing reports enable you to compare today vs last year on this date. We help you understand where your business is coming from, and of any significant shifts! You may be doing a lot better than you think! Monthly Owner Statements : Enter any fees you want to charge your owners, define your date range, click generate and approve them. That’s it. No need to go into Quickbooks or any other third party software. For those of us who truly want to Streamline this process, set up ACH and you don’t even have to pick up the checks at the printer! It’s that simple. ACH will deposit money directly into their account. Vendor Payables: Streamline has a very powerful vendor payables system , which allows you to pay vendors and keep a historical list of payments for those vendors who think they were not paid! How convenient would it be to pay your owners and your vendors with a few clicks and the confidence that they were paid with ACH? Payment Types: We allow you to pay owners and vendors via checks and ACH. Print your check, align your delivery address and send your checks! These checks will be logged into the owner statements which will allow them to see what check was used to pay them. Bulk Mail: Our custom bulk mail system, replaces third party systems and allows you to create dynamic lists to target specific niches. Target marketing works! Revenue Management: Our industry and other industries have historically increased their revenues by yielding their rates. Yielding rates are a constant study and evaluation of pricing and occupancy in your area. Studying the supply and demand curves in your home locations allows you to maximize your revenue!

Robust Accounting When it comes to property management software , having robust accounting functionality is truly a must. That’s why, here at Streamline, we offer three different types of accounting to keep you in trust, all according to your need and expectation. All three are unique and cater to your specific needs, while helping to keep you in trust. TRUST ACCOUNTING One of the most critical components of a property management software system is the capability to provide trust accounting . When dealing with trust accounting , you have to look beyond the wording on websites. “We offer trust accounting ” , this is a claim almost everyone makes. And yet, every state can have unique definitions of what they consider to be trust accounting , some of which have almost no specific regulations. Though that does not imply that you should not run your system without the concept of trust accounting , it does mean that doing your research is a very important part of determining what your state’s trust accounting rules may be. After all, you do not want to be audited and have your business shut down for operating out of trust, and there are no. While software systems can attempt to keep your accounting in trust, if you choose to start using money that is in trust against the rules within your state, there is not a software system out there that can audit your activity based on the rules in your state. To give you one example, in Arizona, long-term rentals have a very unique policy. In the most common definition of trust accounting , you are allowed to pay bills on behalf of the owners using the trust account. The state of Arizona takes this a bit further for long-term rentals. You CANNOT pay a bill for an owner who does not have the funds in their account to pay for that bill. If you are caught doing this, you are considered to be operating outside of trust and you can be shut down. Just do your extra research and operate within the guidelines of your state. Everything will be fine. We also offer a variety of revenue recognition rules. While this does not necessarily fall into trust accounting , when it is time to be audited, you will most definitely need to explain when you recognize revenue. When we recognize revenue, the money is in trust to the OWNER. Be very careful. When it comes to revenue recognition, the money does not belong to the property management company ! Fully compatible With Other Accounting Software – If you have a high level of comfort with your accounting software , we understand completely. That’s why we provide compatibility with most accounting software , so you don’t have to make a change that you don’t want to! Commission Based Accounting – With commission based accounting, you can learn exactly what you’ve made at the end of the day , all with no hassle. With profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and everything else you need to make commission based accounting possible, this is one of the most powerful tools that Streamline has to offer. Here at Streamline, we understand that accounting is one of the most important parts of running a property management business . That’s why we offer the most robust and customizable suite of trust accounting functionalities in the business! For more information, call Streamline today; we can’t wait to hear from you soon. Integrated Partners To be the best, you need to learn from the best. Our clients drive the ingenuity and knowledge that allows us to remain ahead of the competition. Streamline specializes in property management software , but creating direct and seamless connections with other companies that provide quality solutions only makes our property management companies stronger. We’ve teamed up with a host of partners that can provide a tactical and strategic advantage for just about any property manager. BOOKING CHANNELS Today’s OTAs are the backbone that supports and helped create many of the property management companies that exist today. We’ve fully integrated with the best of the best and any bookings that are made through the “BOOK NOW” button are seamlessly included with our system. Being some of the most prominent brands in the vacation industry today, they attract travelers from all over the world and continue to bring visibility to the vacation rental industry and new travelers to the VR marketplace. CHANNEL MANAGERS Channel Managers improve your ability to diversify your listings across a wide variety of distribution channels that go beyond direct integrated options. Each one specializes in connecting to platforms that our partners might otherwise not be able to connect with. Channel Managers open the doors to distributing to more than 100 additional channels. DOOR LOCK AUTOMATION This is definitely the future of property management automation . Our partners have the latest smart technology removing the need for keys, while automating the generation of codes for a guest’s stays. Managing keys is a time consuming and inefficient process. Guests lose keys at inopportune times, requiring property managers to let them. Invest in automation and say goodbye to those days. With our Happy Stays guest app, guests have access to their lock codes all the time. Each of our partners have unique approaches when controlling codes for doors. Some algorithms exist within the door lock, some are Wi-Fi managed, while others are cellular management. It is important to do your research and decide that you can be confident with for many years to come. Purchasing locks is definitely an investment, but after that, you will be opening new doors! HOME AUTOMATION Looking for full control of your home? Control everything that is happening at the homes from a property management standpoint. This is the next generation in home automation. Automatically generate door codes, open doors directly from your mobile phone, preset AC levels for your guests, control lighting for your guests prior to arrival while also putting all of these controls in the guests’ hands. All with notifications for problems with Wi-Fi, thermostat, appliances and any type of changes in temperature (critical for winter locations). Remember, repeat guests and happy owners will make your company successful over the long haul. Saving $$$$ for owners is extremely exciting to owners! Lead Management & Customer Relations Management As property managers, our #1 concern tends to be generating revenue. Probably a very good focal point for continued success. The most important correlation to revenue becomes the owners and your guests. It truly comes down to optimizing the ability to make reservations and maintaining relationships with guests. It also ties into creating a relationship with your owners. What if you could automate all of this? Our lead management system and our customer relation management tools will help to achieve these goals and more. OUR LEAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Here at Streamline, we have the most advanced and creative conversion process. By looking into response times, maximizing quote generation, and putting checks and balance in place, we enable property managers to fill the demands of speed and inquiry conversions. When you put our call tracking system, online chat and SMS platforms in place, you have begun to control your lead sources and enable nearly every form of communication with a client. How many times have you told your sales agents to make sure they select the “Heard About Us” dropdown? How else are you going to know what generates money for you! But, with our phone tracking system, you do not need to rely on your agents anymore. No longer will you have to worry about the “Heard About Us” dropdown, and no longer will you have to puzzle out where your leads are coming from; you will know exactly where the call came from and that phone number determines the source of the call. There are many other features that come into play with our call management component on our lead management system but we encourage you to have a demo and see the full capabilities for yourself! How amazing would it be to receive a phone call and know paramount information concerning the caller? Information that you simply must know when running a property management company , such as if they are actually in your system? With Streamline, this functionality is just the tip of the iceberg. You’ll be able to record calls and tie them into the folio, tap into a call as the manager and listen for training purposes, and even get a transcription of the phone call and analyze calls for specific keywords! Yes, I know this sounds too good to be true; but, as we continue to add functionality, Streamline continues to separate itself from its competitors. Creativity, ingenuity and experience in the property management industry has allowed us to become innovators. These are just a few reasons why our Lead Management system is the best in the industry! CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT Marketing & knowing your target audience is critical to the success of your business. Knowing things such as who you are talking to on the phone and who you should be targeting, depending on the time of year are all extremely important to improving your rental conversion rates. Fortunately, with our CRM system , you will be able to define guest characteristics that are specific to those guests and no one else. This will help give you insight into a variety of guest characteristics that you can use to increase the chance you’ll add them as a customer. For instance, when a call comes into the system, you will actually know what that person likes based on previous experiences. No matter if they enjoy hiking, are bikers, or take pictures, you will know, and you can tailor your sale to those characteristics! With our CRM , you’ll also be able to send bulk mail to all of your hikers that made a reservation with you in 2014 because you have an upcoming hiking event. Remember, the goal of our CRM is to create the ultimate relationship between your guests and your marketing reach. Make sure that you maximize conversions when you are trying to increase sales. If you target the correct audience, at the right time, you will maximize your conversions and revenues. Here are some other aspects our CRM provides: When clients are not clicking into your quotes, it means there was no interaction to view the homes. This should trigger a phone call. Our system tracks whether your quote was delivered to the guest. With the beauty of chat technology, you can create triggers in our system to let you know that it is time to engage with the client. If they have been looking at the home for over a minute, you will be alerted and you can touch base with the prospective guest! Companies with the power to control all of these areas in lead management tend to be the most successful property management companies in their specific areas. Call today to learn more about our Lead Management and CRM system , and we will help you become one of these successful management companies!
