Story Behind the Scenes:
“We had a hard time getting any signal in our addition.” - Heidi
“We had our router on our main floor and experienced difficulty getting a good signal in our basement at the opposite end of our home due to the distance. When using the amplifi signal strengtheners we had a much stronger signal on our devices eliminating frustrations allowing for easier streaming and web searches.”
Heidi
“The home wi-fi that has been installed in my home has now given me confidence that I can do some of my work from home.”
