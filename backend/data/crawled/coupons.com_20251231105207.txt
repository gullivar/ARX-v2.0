Can't beat that! Sam Love Coupons.com Love Coupons.com! It’s such an easy way to save a little extra on stuff I already buy. The app is super simple to use — I just browse, click, and the savings show up when I shop. I’ve found a bunch of deals on groceries and household things I use all the time. The cash back works smoothly too, which is a nice bonus. Honestly, it’s one of those apps that actually does what it says — saves you money without making it complicated. Jordan Burch Overall Overall, easy to use and makes shopping and checkout convenient! Never miss a discount with the Coupons.com browser extension Add the Coupons.com extension to your browser and get cashback without lifting a finger extension_page_hero_action_ Frequently asked questions What is Coupons.com? Coupons.com is your go-to destination for all things savings. We provide shoppers with the best ways to save, including online and in-store coupons to thousands of your favorite stores. We also offer cashback so you can get rewarded every time you shop with us. Our goal is to help you make smarter shopping decisions and save the most money every time you check out! What kind of offers can I expect to find on Coupons.com? When you shop with us, there’s no shortage of ways to save! You can expect to find discounts like sitewide coupon codes, free shipping offers, seasonal sales, gift card rewards, and cashback. Our team is committed to verifying every deal so you save on all orders. Is everything free on Coupons.com? Yes! We can confirm that everything we offer on Coupons.com is completely free. To use our coupons, select the retailer you’d like to shop at and click on the offer that looks best to you. You can click on and use as many coupons from our site as you want. Cashback is also free, but you will need to sign up and log into your account. For grocery and in-store savings, you just need to provide your phone number. After that we'll text you the offer details, including a QR code that you can show to the cashier next time you're shopping in person. Do I need to have an account to receive cashback? Yes, you will need an account to start earning cashback with Coupons.com. Registering is easy! All you need to do is click on the “Sign Up” button on our site. Then, enter your email address and create a password. Once you’ve signed up, we’ll send you an email that includes a link where you can confirm your account. After you've logged in, you can visit Coupons.com to activate your cashback before you check out. Also make sure you accept the store's cookies before you start shopping since that will allow us to properly track your purchases and credit your cashback. Then, anytime you log back into your account, you'll be able to see how much cashback you've earned. From there, you can initiate a transfer to send your extra cash to your PayPal account. How do I start saving with cashback, online coupons, and in-store coupons? To start saving with cashback, coupons, and more, we recommend you visit Coupons.com and sign into your account. Then, you can go to your profile in the right corner. From there, you can check and redeem your cashback balance. You'll also be able to track your payments and transactions, as well as view your saved gift card purchases. To start saving with online coupons, we suggest you download our browser extension to easily test and apply all of our available coupons. Can I stack coupons? It depends on the retailer. In our experience, we have been able to stack a coupon with free shipping and sitewide sales. However, using more than one coupon isn’t typically allowed. Instead, we recommend doubling up on the savings by combining one of our coupons with our cashback offers! Most (but not all) offers can be stacked with cashback so this is a great way to get the most out of your purchase. Just be sure to check the terms and conditions we've provided on the cashback offer. How does cashback work? Cashback lets you put money back in your pocket by refunding you a portion of your online purchase. Our partnership team works hard to secure the very best cashback offers for you. They partner with all your favorite retailers who pay us a commission that we then share with you. It can be a percentage or dollar amount back. For example, if you spend $200 on a new pair of boots and the cashback rate is 4%, you will receive $8 back. If an offer is a dollar amount, you'll receive a fixed refund, regardless of the purchase price. How do I set up the Coupons.com browser extension? Visit Coupons.com and add the extension from the link in our menu. Next, a pop-up will appear asking for your confirmation. After that, our Coupons.com extension will appear in your tool-bar in the top right corner with any other extensions you have downloaded. To use the extension, click on the icon anytime you're checking out at your favorite stores.
