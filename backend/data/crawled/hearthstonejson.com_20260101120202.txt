An API for Hearthstone – HearthstoneJSON HearthstoneJSON JSON files for Hearthstone A HearthSim project • Discord • Join The API is available at api.hearthstonejson.com/v1/ The files are all in JSON format, encoded in UTF-8 and categorized by build,
then by locale. The /v1/latest/ endpoint redirects (302) to whichever build is the latest one. All files are automatically converted from the game files, made available in the hs-data repository . Card objects See full card documentation . Example card: { "id" : "EX1_116" , "dbfId" : 559 , "name" : "Leeroy Jenkins" , "text" : "<b>Charge</b>. <b>Battlecry:</b> Summon two 1/1 Whelps for your opponent." , "flavor" : "At least he has Angry Chicken." , "artist" : "Gabe from Penny Arcade" , "attack" : 6 , "cardClass" : "NEUTRAL" , "collectible" : true , "cost" : 5 , "elite" : true , "faction" : "ALLIANCE" , "health" : 2 , "mechanics" : [ "BATTLECRY" , "CHARGE" ], "rarity" : "LEGENDARY" , "set" : "EXPERT1" , "type" : "MINION" } Card art See full card art and render documentation Changelog 2018-06-27 The card art and render API is now officially available! Patch 7.1.0.17720: playerClass has been renamed cardClass . Both properties are still
available, but the former will be removed in an upcoming patch. The cardback API is no longer supported, as almost nobody was using it. Support for the dust property has been dropped as it is not reliable. New property: referencedTags . This works exactly like mechanics ,
except that it contains tags which are referenced rather than directly
set on the card (for example: Mad Scientist references SECRET ). TREASURE has been renamed to DISCOVER . New property: hideStats (boolean) Patch 7.0.0.15590: The game files have greatly changed for the Gadgetzan patch.
Some of the data may have changed in unexpected ways. New property: multiClassGroup . Currently, this can be GRIMY_GOONS , JADE_LOTUS or KABAL . New property: classes . This is a list of classes, which is only included
when the card is available for multiple classes. Note that the playerClass is usually NEUTRAL for multi-class cards. New property: collectionText . Some cards, most notably Jade Golem cards,
have multiple card texts: A generic one (for the collection) and a formatted
version, with {} placeholders. The collectionText property is the generic
version of the description. The textInPlay property is no longer supported as it is no longer used. Changes since legacy API Website: New website style and theme! API now has its own subdomain and is served with HTTPS API is now versioned (/v1/) Separate output for each build. /v1/latest/ will always give you the latest build. Locales are now generated into their own directory Zip support has been removed in favour of server compression Cards: CardSet separation has been removed as it was largely unused Tags are not localized anymore (mostly this just means uppercased) Created separate “collectible” set Added individual set and targetingArrowText properties Added some more mechanics (forgetful, treasure…) Added entourage property Added playRequirements property Added dust property Card backs: Added more properties from the DBF Support HearthstoneJSON is a HearthSim project and is
