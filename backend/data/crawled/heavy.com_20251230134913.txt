BIJAN ROBINSON: RECORD-FILLED EFFORT IN UPSET WIN
Robinson rushed 22 times for 195 yards and a touchdown and brought in five of eight targets for 34 yards and another score in the Falcons' 27-24 win over the Rams on Monday night. It was truly a night for the ages for Robinson, who provided some luster to a non-playoff season for the Falcons with a career-best effort in the penultimate game of the campaign. Not only was Robinson's rushing yardage total a new single-game career high, but the 93-yard touchdown run late in the first half that was integral in getting him there was also the longest run in franchise history. Robinson also extended his streak of recording at least five catches to three games while recording a receiving TD for the second consecutive contest. Additionally, his production on the ground leaves him just 12 yards short of eclipsing the 1,456 rushing yards he posted last season as the Week 18 regular-season finale against the Saints approaches on Sunday.

MALIK MUSTAPHA: TALLIES THREE TACKLES VS. CHICAGO
Mustapha registered three tackles (two solo) and one pass defense during San Francisco's 42-38 win over Chicago on Sunday. Mustapha played every single defensive snap during Sunday's win, but his three tackles were his lowest since Week 6 against the Buccaneers (two). The second-year safety is up to 71 combined tackles across 11 regular-season games, which is one stop shy from matching his total from his rookie campaign across 16 regular-season games. Mustapha should surpass that mark during the 49ers' Week 18 tilt against the Seahawks on Saturday, a game that will determine who captures the NFC West and enters the postseason as the No. 1 seed in the conference.

JI'AYIR BROWN: TALLIES FOUR STOPS IN WEEK 17 WIN
Brown registered four tackles (one solo) and one pass defense during the 49ers' 42-38 win over the Bears on Sunday. Brown played all 66 defensive snaps during Sunday's win but had just four stops to show for it. It was just the third time he's logged four tackles or less since taking over as the starting safety in Week 6 against the Buccaneers. The third-year pro is up to 68 tackles (39 solo), six pass defenses (two interceptions) and one forced fumble through 16 regular-season games.
