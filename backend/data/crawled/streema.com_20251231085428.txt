It's great to listen to all the time ... Best part is, I can pick radio stations from anywhere anytime ... The streaming is perfect ... No losing signal or freezing ... Bottom line ... Love it! LadyBlu100 I wanted to keep up with my football team while traveling. Found this app while searching the App Store. Did not disappoint! No annoying buffering. Very easy to use. Has also allowed me to explore other radio stations around the country. Nicely done!! Nannimal I downloaded Simple Radio so I could stream my favorite public radio station during my hour and a half bus commute. It works great, with no muss or fuss, remembering what I was listening to last time. Other apps seem to put promoting other stations ahead of letting me get to my favorite station quickly and easily. Jack_Wilder I have been using Simple Radio for several months after ditching one of the recommended apps. This app has worked flawlessly! It has been an amazing find and I highly recommend it (especially if you are getting tired of the buffering and downtime).
