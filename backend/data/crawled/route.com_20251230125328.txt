Shopper · Route Customer

I wasn’t sure about paying for shipping insurance but when only half of my order showed up, I logged in, and Route quickly resolved the issue in less than an hour. Shipping insurance definitely came in handy!

Thank you so much. I was mentally preparing to spend days, if not weeks, dealing with this issue-- and you got it done in less than 10 minutes. You’re amazing!

Shopper · Route Customer

The box that contained my products for my business was wet and crushed. I had some items that were ruined. I emailed and was assisted right away with an email that my products that were damaged will be replaced.
