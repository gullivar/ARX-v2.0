Discover what the coding community is saying about Bugfender

Tudor Watson

Frog Yellow

Bugfender is very easy to use and offers great support. It's ability to help find silent bugs is invaluable.

Volodymyt Shevchenko

AppQ

Bugfender allows me to have remote logs, and investigate really rare bugs and fix them.

Roberta Hendricks

Emma

Our code was developed by a third party, we had no insight as to how things worked in the field. After having major problems, we asked them to integrate Bugfender. It was quick to setup and we were instantly able to discover issues and troubleshoot ourselves. Without Bugfender, we'd have been pretty sunk.

Nabyl Bennouri

CARFIT

Bugfender has allowed us to catch issues that we could not find previously while test driving cars.

David Dunham

On many occasions Bugfender enabled me to look into a bug before the QA had even reported it.

I've been searching for an easy-to-use "Logs as a Service" tool for my Ionic app, and Bugfender has been a perfect find! It offers exactly what I needed, plus the bonus of a Cordova plugin alongside Android and iOS SDKs. The docs and UI/UX are straightforward and user-friendly. Huge thanks to the Bugfender team for the fantastic work!
