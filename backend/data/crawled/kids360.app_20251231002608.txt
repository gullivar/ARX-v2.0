Great app for parents! I set limits on YouTube and gaming, and my son is now spending more time on schoolwork. It’s been a big help, highly recommend it!

Finally found a solution to stop my kids from using their devices late at night. The app turns off games automatically, and no more bedtime arguments. A real lifesaver!
