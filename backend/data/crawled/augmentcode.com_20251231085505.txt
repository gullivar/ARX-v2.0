Install Augment to get started. Install now Contact sales Every engineer came back extremely excited about Augment Code. And that's a very rare thing if you ever worked with engineers for a group to be united in any way and excited about something like this. Dan Van Tran CTO Every engineer came back extremely excited about Augment Code. And that's a very rare thing if you ever worked with engineers for a group to be united in any way and excited about something like this. Dan Van Tran CTO Augment Code is truly like a force multiplier. It has added so much value. It is honestly my favorite tool that I've used. Griffin Rowell Head of Strategy and Technical Solutions at Napster We performed an evaluation of multiple tools in a series of three-week sprints, Augment Code was the clear winner of our evaluation. Rachel Larson Director of Engineering at Peek Forget Cursor, Roo, Cline, Windsurf.
Augment Code just blew my mind.
Give it 5 minutes - you’ll see what I mean. Rom Iluz Account Development Representative Augment is orders of magnitude better than cursor, and any other coding assistant I've ever tried (and I've nearly tried them all).


It's ability to quickly figure out what I'm talking about from zero context inside a very large code base is unmatched from anything I've used yet. planetdaz u/planetdaz After 14 days testing @augmentcode, I canceled my 
@cursor_ai  subscription and pay $30/month for Augment instead.

The $10 difference? WORTH IT. 🧵👇

#aicoding #codingwithai An Van @anvanvan Security and privacy are both vital. Part of the reason we chose Augment Code was because security was addressed even before I could ask questions. Suchitra Hari Director of Engineering, Developer Productivity I’ve used every vibe coding agent in the past year and @augmentcode is #1
codebase indexing/context engine and integrated taskmaster bring out the best in the model
macro project understanding + hyper-focused file edits
very good at solving complex bugs on its own zoot.sol @Solanameister I've tried every agentic IDE from Cursor to Windsurf and Augment Code is by far the best. 🙂 Hiram Clark @hiramclark @augmentcode one shotted the workflow JSON file required for my app's one of the agent backend.
I just imported it in @n8n_io and boom...😍
That was crazy fast!!!
Saved me hours of work literally. Sanket D. @sanketdongre369 I found Augment, and my life has been forever changed. I now have a companion that works in a way that compliments the seeming chaos of my mind. Lewis Popper u/LewisPopper Augment has been very helpful in trying to let me focus on solving the problems instead of writing the code that solves the problems. Nick Anderson Senior Engineer Every feature in Augment feels like it was built by people who actually ship software at scale. Jitender Yadar Frontend Developer Our developers admitted they would personally buy Augment licenses if we didn't provide it for them. Chris Johnson VP Technology Delivery The more I use @augmentcode for @rails development the more I'm convinced it's one of few agents that get's Rails. David Teren @davidteren We needed a tool that could help engineers work across different repos with different languages seamlessly. Joe Luo VP of Engineering apparently cursor goes into an infinite loop if you ask it to implement and run a go benchmark test. not the case with @augmentcode though. AugmentCode is way way way better 🤌🏼 stuckinforloop @stuckinforloop When testing Augment against GitHub Copilot, Augment was the clear winner. Luke Braud CTO Augment has replaced GitHub Copilot as our AI tool of choice because of the deep context Augment brings to every feature. Daryn Lam CTO Augment Code has both the best team and recipe for empowering programmers and their organizations to deliver more and better software. Eric Schmidt Founding Partner I honestly tell people when they join the team or who haven't been using Augment to use Augment because it will just actually surface meaningful suggestions to them. Erica Gucciardo Staff Software Engineer Nobody knows my codebase like #Augment Stephen Dedalus @USSDedalus Been a power user of cursor,windsurf and cline, love all of them. Augment Code is on a different league. It has a deeper understanding of codebase and it rarely makes mistakes. It's a tad slow  but can live with that considering accuracy and time saved in rework. Ajith Aravind @artofseeing23 Why does no one talk about Augment Code? Way better than Cursor and Windsurf. Elnur Nabivi @elnurnabivi There is absolutely no doubt that augment is now superior to windsurf and cursor in every way. @agichronicles @agichronicles Augment is just a class of its own, all those other extensions doesn't even come close! the reliability, the indexing. the memory, it knows your codebase really well.

Wish I could use it for all eternity minami26 u/minami26 I tried everything from cursor, cline, windsurf to visual studio copilot but nothing comes close to Augment Code. The way it reasons and articulates the steps it's going to take before generating the code is amazing! I feel very confident because of the way it structures the code and explains it to me... @augmentcodehas helped re-architect and get my code cleaned up due to the mess made by other editors. Pure magic 🪄🪄🪄 Preetham Reddy @preetham_reddyc Augment Code is solving a different problem than any other AI coding platform I have seen: how to bring together the scattered knowledge and expertise of a team to the fingertips of every engineer so they can stay in flow. Albert Huntington Vice President of Platform Execution Whether you are an engineer new to your company or new to a part of the codebase, you immediately get the full dividends of the context awareness Augment brings. That context makes everything easy and consistent, making it very easy to grow. John Hubberts Founding Engineer I'm not aware of much technical how @augmentcode works inside, but Augment Code solved many issues that I face in code, not even cursor or windsurf could do it. Surprisingly better at fixing code. Nish @nisxant Have you tried coding with Augment Code? That along with your Planner/Executor instructions is by far the best I've used. Beats Cursor, windsurf and Copilot. I literally don't even need to use them anymore. It is absolutely killing it and I don't know why nobody's talking about it Josh @rude_judas In just one month, we're impressed by Augment’s capabilities. Complex migrations, which usually take weeks, now take just days for our senior engineers. Zach Johnson Cofounder We are ending up with better-commented, more descriptive code... it's a beautiful synergy that works so well. Carter Schultz Robotics Architect Tried Cursor and Windsurf for long files, and they just choke... but then I came across Augment, a VS code extension.  the thing rips through a 3,000 line file like it's 10 lines long and makes changes *effortlessly*
I'm SO impressed! totally worth the $30/mo price tag Yazin @yazinsai You should try Augment. Once it learns your code base, it beats the pants off copilot, cursor, windsurf, and Devin. (Tried all of them) @jwatte @jwatte Augment Code is extremely fast. You see the next suggestion in less than 100 milliseconds. It almost feels instant to the human eye. Frank Sahin VP Product and Engineering @augmentcode is the most insane coding agent I've used so far Alex Weichart @AlexWeichart I've tried cursor windsurf and cline. Even roo cline. 

Been with AC for 4 months now and wouldn't switch to anything else Danny Veiga @dannyveigatx Augment code is way underrated! Beats cursor and windsurf easily! Omar Kahwaji @kahwajiiii In just one month, we're impressed by Augment’s capabilities. Complex migrations, which usually take weeks, now take just days for our senior engineers. Marcelo Wessler Co-founder Hands down the best agentic dev tool on the market. 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇 Shaun Foce @shauneff You can ask questions about unknown unknowns and get really insightful answers back. Merrick Christensen Principal Engineer Where Augment really shines is in context-aware tasks. Lukasz Boruszko Principal Architect Augment is solving real world engineering challenges with their contextual awareness of our code base. We are seeing a >40% increase in developer productivity across the board. Ty Schenk CEO Augment actually knows your code base. Jan Baryła Engineering Manager This is insane – it’s the biggest productivity improvement ever. Gene Berdichevsky Founder & CEO We are strong believers in Augment Code’s potential to not only eat the code assistant market, but redefine how software engineering is performed at scale! Shardul Shah Partner In our due diligence, we found Augment’s depth and breadth of AI talent to be greater than that of all the other startups in the space combined. Alex Clayton Partner Augment Code is the rare platform that lives up to, and surpasses, AI hype. Chintan Shah VP Engineering I was super blown away because it allows you to say, 'Hey, Augment, where is this feature implemented?' And it can surface the frontend code, the backend code, and also the SQL migration. Christophe Plat Software development engineer
