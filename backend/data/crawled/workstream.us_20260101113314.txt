Join over the 46 of the top 50 QSR brands using workstream Restaurants deserve better Most tools weren’t built for the chaos of running multi-unit restaurants. They fall apart with hourly schedules, changing labor laws, and high turnover. Six tools. Zero Sync. Hiring, onboarding, scheduling, and payroll don’t talk — so you have to re-enter info, juggle exports, and stitch spreadsheets together by hand. Multi-roles. Multi-EIN. Tracking ACA compliance, tip pooling, and meal breaks across  multiple locations is manual, messy, and full of legal landmines. High turnover. No time. Spending hours posting jobs, screening resumes, and fielding candidate questions — only to get ghosted on interview day.
