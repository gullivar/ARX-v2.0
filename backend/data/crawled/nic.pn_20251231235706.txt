Thanks… sending you to our lookup now. .PN Registry The country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Pitcairn Islands. Nominet maintains and operates the .PN registry on behalf of the Government of the Pitcairn Islands . We are in the process of updating the registry to enhance the security of the .pn top-level domain using DNS Security Extension (DNSSec) and to enable the introduction of a Registry-Registrar support model which will use an industry-standard Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) for a Shared Registry System (SRS) with modern Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) server and a competitive registrar market. We will announce further details as they become available.  Until those changes are in place the registry will continue to be managed and supported through our specialist support team which can be contacted at RegistryManagement@nominet.uk to manage domain updates, registrations or renewals.
