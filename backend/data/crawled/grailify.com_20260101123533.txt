    there will probably still be one or two soles to wear. But never mind! We're working on it! Grailify offers news for sneakerheads, fashion mongers, smart dressers and all those who
    often get a little feeling of happiness when they see new sneakers. As we not only know this feeling, but are all too happy to experience it ourselves, we have
    set up our sneaker release calender in 2016. Of course, we'll let you be part of it!
    Sneakerheads stick together. Persistently expanding the sneaker fan community with new
    sneaker news is therefore something like a family reunion for us. Never Miss a Sneaker Release, Restock or Sale Again At Grailify you will always find all the release dates of new sneakers with photos and the
    most important information: What characterises the new sneakers? In which colourways are
    they available? Where can you buy the new beauties in-store or online? Who offers sneaker
    vouchers or raffles? Of course, we'll also provide you with the relevant links and tell you what
    we think of the release. We also list comparable products for each new shoe at the bottom of the pages - always
    according to the motto: "one pair is better than the other!" So if you're currently looking for a
    new pair of sneakers: Take your time. At Grailify, you'll not only find sneaker news, but you
    can also be guided from one shoe to another. The Grailify Sneaker Search Engine with Over 50,000 Sneakers from Over 100 Online Shops Are you looking for a new sneaker from your favourite brand and it doesn't necessarily have

Grandmas' or grandpas' somewhat questioning looks
      can usually be quickly brightened up by using the word "sports shoes", while with dads and
      mums a word like "trainers" is more likely to steer the conversation in the right direction.
      Word-savvy contemporaries, on the other hand, also draw the right conclusions from
      syllables such as kicks, joggers, takkies or chucks. Our beloved shoes with rubber soles are
      not only versatile, but also pretty polyglot! To do justice to this, we have set up a News Blog that we have filled to the brim with sneaker
      news from Europe and all over the world. You'll find the latest news from the rumour mill as well as pictures of first look
      announcements and everything we've just picked up for you from the sneaker scene. Read more Rate us on ProvenExpert.com Follow us Get our app Brands • Models • Collaborations • Site Notice • About Us • Privacy Policy • Contact • Cookie Preferences
