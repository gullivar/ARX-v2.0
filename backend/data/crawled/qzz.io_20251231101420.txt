Portability by design Bring your own DNS, CDN, or hosting provider (e.g. Cloudflare, AWS, Hostry, FreeDNS) while keeping your DigitalPlat identity stable as you grow. Stewardship that protects the namespace for the long term DigitalPlat Domain is operated by the DigitalPlat Foundation, a global nonprofit fiscally sponsored by The Hack Foundation (EIN 81-2908499). We maintain reliable infrastructure, transparent policies, and humane abuse response so the namespace remains stable, interoperable, and worthy of trust. Open access, global reach Names are available worldwide with bring-your-own DNS flexibility. Trustworthy governance Policies on privacy, and acceptable use prioritize safety, accountability, and respect for internet freedom. Abuse response with care Our Trust & Safety Team works alongside AI safeguard models and automated abuse-auditing APIs from our security partners. Together, they review reports and detect misuse proactively, removing harmful domains while protecting legitimate expression and access. We have some fans.
