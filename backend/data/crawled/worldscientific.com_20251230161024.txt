NEW REVIEWS

Emergent Gauge Symmetries in Particle Physics and Cosmology
By (author): Steven D Bass (Kitzbühel Centre for Physics, Austria & Jagiellonian University, Poland)

"Steven Bass' book on emergent symmetries makes a compelling case for the new paradigm of emergence as the guiding principle for understanding elementary particle physics and its mysteries and open problems. There is a need to understand and find the patterns that characterize the Standard Model of particle physics and provide clues to solutions to unsolved problems in particle physics and cosmology, where gravity merges with particle physics. Condensed matter physics is a treasure trove of emergent phenomena that often helps to understand structures such as renormalizable quantum field theories and their underlying symmetries. Enjoy reading this comprehensive introduction and gain a new perspective on particle physics, cosmology, and what nature might reveal to us beyond."

Professor Fred Jegerlehner
DESY-Zeuthen and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin


 

The Reasoning of Traditional Chinese Medicine
By (author): Song Xuan Ke (Asanté Academy, UK)

"Throughout the book, Professor Ke describes key differences between western medicine and TCM and directly addresses specific questions that critics of TCM might raise. Readers benefit from the thoughtful and deep consideration the author has given these divergences over the years."[Read Full Review]

FEATURED SPECIAL ISSUES
	Special Issue on Thirty Years of Gauged Linear Sigma Models

Guest Editors: Mykola Dedushenko, Heeyeon Kim, Johanna Knapp, Ilarion Melnikov and Eric Sharpe

Since they were first introduced in his Phases paper in 1993, Witten’s gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) have proven to be extraordinary tools, both by providing key insights into numerous aspects of string theory and supersymmetric field theory and by bridging to various fields in mathematics such as enumerative and algebraic geometry and category theory.

	Special Issue on 2D Materials

Guest Editor: P. Chakraborty

The Special Issue “2D Materials: Perspectives” with its multi-pronged dimensions has stepped in the world of 2D materials, focusing on the latest peer-reviewed research articles on various 2D materials from their conceptual understandings to synthesis, characterizations, properties and applications in diverse areas.

	Special Issue on Climate Change Impacts on Financial Markets

Guest Editors: Xiaohang Ren and Giray Gozgor

This special issue examines how climate change impacts financial markets. It is well understood that changes in the climate will impact different sectors of the economy. Banks which provide loans to companies in each sector are therefore vulnerable. However, measuring this effect on loan portfolios is a challenging issue because each enterprise has activities in very different places. Climate change may also affect how financial markets value different assets including stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities.
