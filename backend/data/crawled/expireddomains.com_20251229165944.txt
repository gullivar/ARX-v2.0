Good for flipping or just grabbing brand names
Been using ExpiredDomains for about a month and I’ve already picked up a few solid names — one of them’s already flipped. The name value and SEO price estimates are really handy. I wish the design was a bit cleaner but functionally, it’s spot on.

Honestly didn’t expect it to be this good
Saw this recommended on a forum and didn’t expect much, but wow. The amount of data it shows is crazy for a free tool. I use it mostly to look for brandable names and cross-check SEO value. Already registered a couple. Definitely bookmarking this.

Great for finding niche domains
I run a few small affiliate sites and I’m always looking for expired domains with decent backlink profiles. ExpiredDomains saves me a ton of time. Filters are a bit overwhelming at first but once you figure it out, it’s so much faster than doing it manually. Found 3 great ones last week.

Frequently Asked Questions
Your queries answered
How to find expired domains with backlinks?
On Expireddomains.com, you can search for expired domain names with powerful backlinks. Our filters let you check records like backlink count, domain authority, traffic, and hosting history. For accuracy, we recommend also looking at the Wayback Machine to review old pages and confirm the site wasn’t used for spam before you register it.
How to find expired domains?
Use our daily updated lists of deleted and pending delete domains. You can filter by TLDs and gTLDs (like .com, .org, .net), domain length, or traffic. Many users like to start with free filters before upgrading to premium features. The process is simple: search, review the data, and if you like what you see, continue to checkout and register.
How to buy expired domains?
Once you’ve found a domain on Expireddomains.com, you can place a bid or pay the purchase price through our integrated registrar partners. You’ll need a valid account to complete registration. Most domains can be claimed immediately after they’re released, while others may go into auction before sale.
Where to buy expired domains?
Expireddomains.com is your one-stop service for finding, vetting, and purchasing expired domains. We work with multiple registrar partners so you don’t have to track each registrar separately. All you need is one secure account to search, bid, and register.
How to find expired domains with traffic?
Look for expired domains that still get visitors from search engines like Google. Our platform shows estimated traffic, backlinks, and keywords for each page. An example: you might find a dropped domain still ranking for SEO terms that can drive traffic immediately to your new site.
How to find expired domains with domain authority?
Use filters on Expireddomains.com to find expired domain names with high domain authority. Always check backlink quality to avoid spam or blocked domains. If a domain was renewed multiple times by the same owner, that often signals higher trust.
How to get expired domains?
You can backorder or bid on them directly through Expireddomains.com. Domains go through different stages — grace period, redemption, pending delete — before being released. If you’re waiting for a high-value name, you can set alerts so you don’t miss the chance to grab it.
How to make money with expired domains?
Many of our users build niche sites with hosting and content, redirect domains for SEO, or resell them at a higher value. As an example, buying expired domains with clean backlink records and transferring them into a new project can create quick marketing wins.
How to use expired domains for SEO?
You can redirect an expired domain to your main website, rebuild it with new content, or set it up as a supporting site. Expireddomains.com makes the research easy by giving you accurate backlink and traffic metrics, so you don’t waste budget on poor-quality domains.
How to find the best expired domains?
The best domains combine clean history, good backlinks, and a trusted domain extension (like .com, .org, or .net). Use Expireddomains.com filters to sort by metrics, registrar, and traffic. Always review the Wayback Machine for examples of past use to ensure quality.
How to find high PR expired domains?
PageRank is no longer public, but you can still find strong expired domains by checking authority metrics, backlink profiles, and content history. Expireddomains.com shows accurate records so you can vet domains properly before purchase.
How long does Expireddomains.com hold expired domains?
Most registrars, including GoDaddy, hold expired domains for around 30 days before they move into auctions or pending delete status. Expireddomains.com aggregates these domains in real time so you can track them without needing to monitor each registrar separately.
How to use expired domains?
You can develop a new site, redirect the domain to boost SEO, or hold it as a digital asset for future sale. Always check hosting records, transfer history, and spam status before investing.
When do expired domains become available?
Most domains become available 30–75 days after expiration, depending on the registrar. After the grace period and pending delete phase, the name is released and open for registration. Expireddomains.com shows the exact waiting times so you know when to act.
