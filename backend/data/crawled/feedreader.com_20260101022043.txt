Our team has recently renovated the Feedreader website’s UI in order to streamline and adapt it for mobile devices. We hope you will love our new elegant and modern look!

Get ready for the news observer by Feedreader!

Wednesday, September 28th, 2016

Just imagine a service, which on the one hand lets you preview any site’s RSS feed without even subscribing to it in Feedreader Online, and on the other hand helps you broaden your horizons by suggesting some alternative news sources.
Such a “quick view” service would allow you not only to check the availability or activity of a certain website’s RSS feed (to make sure it’s not broken or outdated) before adding it, but also to find and observe more feeds/news related to similar subjects. Feedreader team is on its way to launching such an instant feed observer in early 2017, so stay tuned!

We are glad to present Deets Feedreader!

Feedreader has proudly expanded its platform with a new service - Deets Feedreader!
