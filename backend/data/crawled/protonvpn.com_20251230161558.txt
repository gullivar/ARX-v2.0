Notes
Your key to unlocking the internet

When you use a VPN (virtual private network), your traffic is routed through a secure server that hides your real IP address and encrypts the data your device sends and receives.

This makes it harder for websites, advertisers, and even your internet service provider (ISP) to track where you are and what you do online.

Amazing VPN: privacy focused, lots of servers to choose, and some extra safeguards such as ad tracking prevention. The best out there 👌
