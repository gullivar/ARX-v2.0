Over 30 years of success for elite practices In the 1990s, we introduced our first nationwide marketing campaigns for the Elective Healthcare and Legal Industries. We began advertising on major search engines such as AOL, Alta Vista, Excite, Goto, Hotbot, Infoseek, Lycos, Looksmart, Webcrawler, and Netscape. At that time, the World Wide Web did not work well for local businesses. Our exclusive directories were designed to funnel global search traffic to our local service providers. Today, we continue to develop the most innovative solutions for the most elite practices in the world.
