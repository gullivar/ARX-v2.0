How many servings are in one meal? As a general rule of thumb, one CookUnity meal is intended to serve one person. If you're ordering for multiple people, our larger meal plans work well (8, 12, 16 meals/week). We encourage you to try different options and share "family style." How long do the meals last? Since we don't use artificial or chemical preservatives, the meals have a refrigerated shelf life of about 3-7 days. Every meal has a "use by" date on the label. Are meals frozen? Great question! At this time, our Chefs advise against freezing meals as this may compromise the taste and overall freshness of the dish. Furthermore, our recyclable trays are not fit for freezing. Since we don't use artificial or chemical preservatives, the meals have a refrigerated shelf life of about 3-7 days. Didn't find what you were looking for?
