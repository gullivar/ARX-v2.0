Featured Article: Kabir Kabir with a disciple Kabīr (1398-1448) or (1440—1518) was an Indian mystic whose teachings stressed two primary themes: the possibility of spiritual union with the Divine and the utter contingency of all religious and ideological distinctions. Though many details of his life remain shrouded in mystery, certain biographical elements (such as his low caste birth and his occupation as a weaver) are common to all versions of his biography. The lyrical beauty of Kabir's poetic outpourings of love for the Divine make him a figure of inter-religious understanding and harmony.
