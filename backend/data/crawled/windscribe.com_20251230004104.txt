Why Windscribe F*cks

We’re more than just a VPN.

We Don’t Pay to Play, We Build

We’re self-funded, bootstrapped, and don’t pay for ads or reviews. We answer to no-one, except you. Powered by principles, not pockets.

So Transparent, We’re Naked

Windscribe is open source, letting you see exactly what you’re signing up for. Our transparency reports, audits, and court wins prove it.

We Can’t Share What We Don’t Have

Our RAM disk infrastructure stores no identifying data anywhere. Keep your online activity private from everyone, including us!

Pay The Price That Was Promised

Honest, no B.S. billing! The price you signed up for is the price you pay. Forever. Predictable, but in a good way.

Buzzword Overload

AES256, “Super Duper Encryption,” “No Logs,” “Military Grade” (but not like that cheap gov stuff made by the lowest bidder). You get the point. We’re not just here to play—Windscribe f*cks.

Much love from me and my family. I think the developers are dedicated to a cause rather than cashing in on other people's misery. Outstanding performance and functionality, very low minimum price.

Frequently Asked Questions
How Do I Choose the Best VPN for My Needs?

No two people are the same; some VPN users may prioritize security features, while others might just be looking for the cheapest price. Here's a handy reference list of how to choose the best VPN:

Privacy & Logging Policy: Ensure the VPN does not log your browsing activity. Windscribe has a strict no-logs policy.

Speed & Server Locations: Global servers mean more options to get an IP address of your choice and better speeds. Windscribe offers a wide range of locations with optimized performance.

Security Features: Look for AES-256 encryption, ad/tracker blocking, and a firewall. Windscribe includes all these and more, like Double Hop and Split Tunneling.

Device Compatibility: Ensure the VPN works on your devices (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, routers). Windscribe supports all major platforms.

Bypass Censorship: If you're in a country with strict internet controls, choose a VPN with stealth features. Windscribe’s anti-censorship feature helps bypass the toughest restrictions.

Pricing & Flexibility: Some VPNs force expensive yearly plans. Windscribe’s Build-a-Plan option lets you customize your subscription for as little as $3/month.

If you need a VPN that prioritizes privacy, flexibility, and strong features without breaking the bank, Windscribe is a top choice.
