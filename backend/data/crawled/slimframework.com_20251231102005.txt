        by running this bash command: $ composer create-project slim/slim-skeleton [my-app-name] Replace [my-app-name] with the desired directory name for your new application. You can then run it with PHP's built-in webserver: $ cd [my-app-name]; php -S localhost:8080 -t public Features HTTP Router Slim provides a fast and powerful router that maps
                    route callbacks to specific HTTP request methods and
                    URIs. It supports parameters and pattern matching. Middleware Build your application with concentric middleware to tweak
                    the HTTP request and response objects around your Slim app. PSR-7 Support Slim supports any PSR-7 HTTP message implementation
                    so you may inspect and manipulate HTTP message method,
                    status, URI, headers, cookies, and body. Dependency Injection Slim supports dependency injection so you
                    have complete control of your external tools.
                    Use any PSR-11 ContainerInterface implementation.
