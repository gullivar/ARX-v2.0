M365 Premier Support Ambassador I love getscreen.me for the quick possibility to connect to an installed agent via a web browser - the rendering of graphical UI is faster then for example a remote desktop solution of other brands. I am beginning to use this more and more every day as I become used to just open the app or browser and connect to a screen. As I only have to install one agent to use it, its easy to integrate and it supports Windows and mac.there doesnt seem to be any way of accessing alpha or beta builds. however as I could contact support i think they would be easily able to help me fix this as well. The Uiser interface and easiness of implementation is also is a great point. I love the easy to use features of the UI in case of file transfers - something which is super intuitive and useful as well as really easy to use. great product all in all! Jeniffer L.
