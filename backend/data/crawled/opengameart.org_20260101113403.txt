By MedicineStorm on 23 July 2025 - 4:30pm We're experimenting with cross-promotion with our various sister marketplaces, including: itch.io | Sketchfab | Freesound.org | Godot asset store BETA The following OGA artists host content on some of these other platforms. Check them out! 2DPIXX on Godot store! Tsorthan Grove on Godot store! Screaming Brain Studios on Itch.io! IDoTheDrawing on Itch.io! If you would like to cross-promote your content, just follow these steps: Have some assets hosted here on OGA. Submit some of your assets to one of the platforms listed above. The assets don't need to be the same as your stuff on OGA, but they must be shared under one of the free licenses accepted on OGA (or be compatible with such licenses): CC0, OGA-BY, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, WTFPL, Public Domain, et cetera. This doesn't mean all of your content on those platforms must be under a free and open license, but the ones featuring a banner (below) must be. Display one of the banner images below and link back to Opengameart.org . When submitting assets to one of the above platforms, add a link to OGA's main page (https://opengameart.org), your OGA profile page, or one of your OGA submission pages. Display one of the banner images below as one of the media previews or in the asset page's description. Let us know! Post a comment below linking to your asset on the other platform(s). We'll add your information above and promote you here! NOTE: Due to the Terms-of-Use on these other platforms, you should only share assets where you have explicit permission from all contributing artists. If you plan to share assets derived from prior free works, you should obtain permission from the authors of all works that your asset was derived from before sharing it on the above platforms. If you are the sole author of your assets, no problem! Just give yourself permission to share your work! :D NOTE: OGA has no official affiliation or promotion with these platforms. Although we wouldn't mind that, this is just a friendly attempt to give well-deserved attention to some of our favorite artists and platforms. 7 comments MedicineStorm's blog Log in or register to post comments OpenGameArt.org Spring Game Jam 2025 - Symbiosis By RUOK on 7 June 2025 - 1:01pm Jam starts on: July 21st 2025 at 11:00 AM [GMT] Submissions due by: August 21st 2025 at 11:00 AM [GMT] Theme: " Symbiosis " Visit the Official Game Jam itch page: https://itch.io/jam/opengameartorg-summer-jam-2025 Chat with us on the Game Jam Discord Channel: https://discord.com/channels/694961698272051281/1381001128438927480 0 comments RUOK's blog OpenGameArt.org's Fall Game Jam 2024 "Festival" By MedicineStorm on 14 October 2024 - 12:00am Jam starts on: October 14th 2024 at 12:21 PM [GMT] Submissions due by: November 14th 2024 at 1:21 PM [GMT] Visit the Official Game Jam itch page: https://itch.io/jam/opengameartorgs-fall-game-jam-2024 Chat with us on the Game Jam Discord Channel: https://discord.com/channels/694961698272051281/1295098293428162560 0 comments MedicineStorm's blog OpenGameArt.org Game Jam - March 2024 By food_please on 20 February 2024 - 4:19pm Jam starts on: February 29th, 2024 at 8 :00 AM [GMT] Submissions due by: April 2nd, 2024 at 8:00 AM [GMT] Visit the Official Game Jam itch page: https://itch.io/jam/ogajam-2403 Chat with us on the Game Jam Discord Channel: https://discord.com/channels/694961698272051281/1209507505047212082 or the Game Jam's forum page: https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/opengameart-game-jam-march-2024 0 comments food_please's blog Open Game Art’s Game Jam Summer 2023 By withthelove on 9 June 2023 - 8:54am Come one, come all!
