To get started, just create a free Claspo account. You can immediately begin building pop-ups to target visitors, collect leads, and explore all features without paying anything upfront. Once you’re in, choose a template from our library of more than a thousand ready-made designs — this saves a lot of time and design effort. After picking the template, you’re free to change the styling and the message until it feels right, and choose the situation where the pop-up should show for the visitor. To have it appear on your website, you just place a short script in your pages. That’s all the setup you need. Why choose Claspo popup builder software? Our drag-and-drop popup builder makes it easy to build pop-ups that actually convert — without needing a designer or a bunch of tools. There’s a big template library — over a thousand to pick from — so you’re not building everything from the ground up. You choose one, make a few changes to the layout or wording, and it’s ready to go. The editor’s drag-and-drop, pretty easy to use. But if you like to get into the details, there’s room to do that too. As for who sees what — that’s up to you. You can set it to show messages based on where someone’s visiting from, what they’re doing on the site, or even which page they’re on. Add triggers like scroll, time on page, exit intent — whatever fits your flow. There’s also A/B testing if you want to compare ideas, plus real-time analytics so you can track what’s working and what’s not. And if you want to drive engagement, the popup builder tool has gamified widgets too — spin-to-win, scratch cards, that sort of thing — which tend to catch more attention than regular forms. One of the best parts? Every feature is available on every plan — even the free one. No hidden paywalls, no watered-down versions. You get the full toolkit of popup builder tools right from the start. How popup builder works? A popup builder isn’t tough to figure out. You pick a template that matches what you’re trying to do, like adding more subscribers or trying to keep someone from leaving their cart. Then you can tweak how it looks and what it says so it doesn’t stick out on your site. After that, you choose when it should show up. Maybe only on a couple of pages, maybe for people from certain places, or maybe when they scroll or look like they’re about to leave. Once the popup’s live, you can run an A/B test by creating another take on it and see which one your audience seems to prefer. The numbers update while people use your site. If you’re gathering emails, you’ll see those contacts listed in the leads section with the details you collected. What is required to use Claspo Popup Widgets? All you really need is access to your site. You don’t have to bring in a developer or chase down a designer for help. To show widgets, you add a tiny piece of code to your pages — and that’s pretty much the whole setup. It’s very light, so your pages won’t start crawling. Our popup builder software connects with most popular platforms out there: WordPress, Shopify, and a bunch of other CMS tools. You can also set everything up through Google Tag Manager if that’s how you manage scripts. Once the snippet is added, you can build widgets in the visual editor by dragging things into place. Everything happens there — no coding needed just to publish something. What type of popups can I create? Claspo has several layouts to choose from. Popup widget shows up in the middle of the screen — can’t miss and great for urgent messages. Floating boxes are more subtle, sit in the corner without interrupting the experience. Floating bars sit at the top or bottom — perfect for promos, shipping info or quick updates. Built-in widgets sit inside the page layout and blend in with the content. Teasers start as small buttons and expand when clicked — clean and unobtrusive. Content-blocking widgets cover the page until visitors take action — great for age checks or consent. All are fully customizable and you decide who sees what, when and where. Are there pre-designed popup templates to customize from? Yes — our custom popup builder has a full library of pre-designed templates you can start with. There are over 1000 of them, covering different goals, layouts, and occasions — from email signups and promo codes to seasonal offers and cart recovery. You can change whatever you need — the colors, the wording, layout, images, all of it. Nothing’s locked in. The entire template library is available on every plan, including the free one. No locked designs, no limits. What platforms does the Claspo popup tool integrate with? Claspo plays nicely with the platforms most people already use. WordPress, Shopify, other CMS tools — no problem. You can also hook it up using Google Tag Manager if that’s your thing. For email and CRM, the popup software connects directly with tools like HubSpot, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Pipedrive, ActiveCampaign, GetResponse, MailerLite, and Salesforce. So getting your leads where they need to go is pretty smooth. And if the one you need isn’t there yet? Just let us know. You can send a quick request, and we’ll look into adding it. Can I display several popups on the same page? Are there overlap protection? Yes, you can show more than one pop-up on the same page — but without overwhelming your visitors. The website popup builder handles that for you. Even if you set up a few widgets with the same rules by accident, they won’t all pop up at once or cover each other. The no-code popup builder sorts it out in the background, so your visitors see things one at a time — not a mess of pop-ups. The website popup software makes sure they appear one at a time. There’s also a Silence interval by default — usually around 3 minutes between widgets — so people aren’t hit with messages back to back. You can adjust that timing if you need to — depends on how people usually move through your site. The idea’s just to keep things feeling natural. Can I manage multiple client projects from a single dashboard? If you work with clients as an agency, marketer, or freelancer, there’s a solid option for you. With the Advanced plan, you can handle widgets for multiple sites and invite up to 3 people to work with you — perfect for client projects. With the Pro plan, you get unlimited websites and up to 10 team member seats. What kind of support is available for agencies using Claspo? If you’re working as an agency, you won’t be left figuring things out on your own. You get a dedicated manager who stays in touch and handles your requests directly — so no bouncing between departments or waiting forever for answers. Just one person who knows your setup and helps you keep things running smoothly. Are widgets mobile-optimized? Yes, widgets show up fine on mobile. You can switch to mobile view while editing if you want to check how things look. If something feels off, like too much text or stuff that doesn’t fit well, you can hide bits or tweak things just for phones. It mostly handles layout on its own though, so you’re not stuck adjusting everything from scratch. How does Claspo help with targeting and triggers? You can control exactly who sees your popup widget for websites and when it appears. If someone scrolls far enough, spends time on a certain page, visits a few pages in a row, or goes idle — you can set a widget to react to that. Same with exit intent. It’s all based on what the visitor’s doing, right then and there. You can also choose who sees what: new vs returning visitors, people from specific locations, mobile vs desktop, folks coming from certain ads or emails. If you want to go deeper, you can even target using cookies, UTM links, or JavaScript values — like showing something only to logged-in users or people with a full cart. It’s all about timing the message so it actually makes sense — not just throwing popups at everyone. Does Claspo offer real-time analytics? Yes, the popup tool gives you access to real-time analytics. You can quickly see how your widget is performing — and if it’s not working as expected, you’ll spot it right away. That means you can react fast: adjust the triggers, change up the targeting, tweak the copy — whatever needs fixing, without waiting or guessing. Everything updates as it happens. What pricing plans does Claspo Popup Builder offer? Claspo has a range of plans to fit different business sizes and traffic levels — from solo websites to large teams. The Free plan is a great place to start. You get access to all features, support for one website, up to 3 widgets, and 1 team member. The ‘Powered by Claspo’ badge stays on, but otherwise, nothing’s locked. As for Basic, it’s meant for small sites. You get one website, space for up to five widgets, and one user. It’s simple, and the branding’s off, so your setup looks clean right away. If you’re growing and need a bit more flexibility, the Advanced plan might make sense. You can connect up to five websites, use as many widgets as you like, and bring in a few more people — up to three team members total. Pro gives you everything unlocked — unlimited widgets and websites, up to 10 team members, and priority support. And for businesses with over 500K monthly pageviews or custom needs, there’s the Prime plan — tailored to your setup. You’ll need to reach out to the team for pricing and details. Can I get a refund if needed? If you change your mind, you can request a refund within 30 days on a monthly subscription, or within 100 days on a yearly one. Just reach out to us — we won’t hassle you about it.
