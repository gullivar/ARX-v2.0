Forbes Travel Guide Star Rated Hotels, Restaurants & Spas X VIEW ALL RESULTS VIEW ALL RESULTS We are the only independent, global rating system for luxury hotels, restaurants, spas and ocean cruise ships. Here are five things to know about us: 1. We verify luxury. Our highly trained inspectors visit every property we rate, evaluating based on up to 900 objective criteria. Our hotel stays span a minimum of two nights. 2. We pay our own way.No one can buy a rating; all ratings are earned through our objective inspection process. 3. Our global team of inspectors are anonymous at all times, so they have the same experience as a typical guest. 4. While we inspect both service and facility, our Star Rating system emphasizes service because your experience at a hotel, restaurant or spa goes beyond looks — how it makes you feel is what you will remember most. 5. We started in1958 as Mobil Travel Guide, and we created the original Five-Star rating system for hospitality. For press inquiries, please click here . Five-Star These properties deliver an
outstanding experience and consistently offer a highly customized level of
service. Four-Star These are exceptional properties, offering high levels of service and quality of facility to match.
