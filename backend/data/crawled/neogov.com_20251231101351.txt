Top Questions We Get Asked What are the benefits of using a comprehensive, integrated HR suite vs. multiple products? By housing these applications under one umbrella, NEOGOV simplifies data sharing, user provisioning, and consistency across the employee lifecycle. NEOGOV offers solutions that cover multiple HR functions, including applicant tracking ( Insight ), candidate relationship management ( Attract ), onboarding ( Onboard ), performance management ( Perform ), learning management ( Learn ), custom forms ( eForms ), Human Resources Information System ( HRIS ), background investigations ( Vetted ), and compliance management ( Policy ). What are the advantages of using an HR platform built for the public sector vs. a standard HR system? NEOGOV is purpose-built for government agencies, municipalities, and the broader public sector. As a result, features like transparency, records retention (TRR) compliance, organizational hierarchies, and budgetary constraints are considered from the outset. The platform’s forms, workflows, and reporting capabilities align with public-sector regulations (e.g., EEO, veterans’ preference) and accreditation standards. What capabilities does NEOGOV have to support compliance and security ? NEOGOV addresses public-sector compliance needs, including credentialing, audit trails, and secure e-signature workflows. Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, supporting security requirements such as HIPAA (where applicable), CJIS (for law enforcement), and other regulatory frameworks. NEOGOV also holds certifications and attestations across multiple industry standards, including SOC 2 Type II, NIST 800-53 Moderate, and PCI-DSS self-certification. We are StateRAMP and TxRAMP authorized and listed in the StateRAMP Marketplace, demonstrating our commitment to data protection and public sector compliance. My agency has a lot of unique needs . Will NEOGOV work for us? Government HR processes are often highly specialized. NEOGOV solutions are designed to be highly configurable, allowing administrators to tailor workflows (e.g., approvals, notifications), forms, and user roles to match your agency’s structure and policies. This configurability makes it easy for large agencies with diverse departments to adopt the system without sacrificing flexibility. How do we know that implementation will work for us with the resources and time we have? Whether you're part of a small municipality or a large state agency, NEOGOV’s SaaS (Software as a Service) model reduces the need for on-premise infrastructure and IT resources. The platform scales easily and delivers updates and new features automatically. NEOGOV also offers tailored onboarding services, training, and customer support, with a deep understanding of public-sector procurement and change management. Many customers highlight our specialized support teams as key to successful adoption. What will the user experience be like for my employees? Is it easy to use? Unlike many legacy government systems, NEOGOV is designed with a modern, user-friendly interface. This allows employees, managers, and HR administrators to learn the platform quickly with minimal training. Self-service portals enable employees to complete routine tasks—like updating personal information or completing benefits forms — without relying on HR.
