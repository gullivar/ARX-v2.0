📢 Attention: The UDISE+ data entry period has been extended beyond 30th September 2025 and will remain open till 31st December 2025.

The Unified District Information System for Education Plus is an educational management information system under the Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Education under the Government of India. UDISE+ functions as a central platform that enables respective schools to efficiently record and submit data related to its profile (infrastructure & facilities), individual students and teachers’ details. This is done in real-time mode by all recognised schools that provide formal, and special education in any of the school categories (that is, from pre-primary to higher secondary levels) throughout the country each academic year. The recorded data is validated by the MIS and other designated officials at the block, district and state levels; and monitored at four levels, including the national.

This makes UDISE+ one of the largest management information systems for credible information collection mechanisms and serves as the official statistics of the Ministry of Education.
