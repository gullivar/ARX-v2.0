Analyze 2. Rebuild 3. Deliver Led by AI and neuroscience experts, SpeedSize understands how the brain perceives visual information. SpeedSize automatically analyzes ~100 elements per image or video frame to determine what the brain can and cannot perceive. Each pixel is treated uniquely in the context of the whole, and given the best optimization method. SpeedSize breaks the image apart and removes the unnecessary pixels the human eye just doesn't see. 
                Each AI-optimized image is rebuilt as an indistinguishable variation, preserving the original high quality but up to 99% smaller in file size. Deliver each media file from SpeedSize’s edge CDN or yours.
