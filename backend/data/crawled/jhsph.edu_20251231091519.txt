Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH)

The Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) is a professional degree alternative to the Master of Public Health (MPH) degree for students who want more focused skills in a specific field of public health or who lack two years of health-related work experience to begin or advance a career as a public health professional. MSPH programs generally require one academic year of coursework, followed by a field placement. The field placement duration and location vary by department/concentration.

A healthy childhood is essential for lifelong well-being, but urgent problems, like chronic absenteeism, the impact of digital devices on mental health, and exposures to environmental toxins, are threatening U.S. kids’ ability to thrive and flourish into adulthood.
