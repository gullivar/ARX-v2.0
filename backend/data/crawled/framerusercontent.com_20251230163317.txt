This release is led by the new Create Collection API, which lets plugins create CMS collections, immediately focus them, and continue workflows like importing data without requiring any other manual collection setup. The rest of the update focuses on user experience improvements and reliability across plugins and CMS syncing. It also adds new layout and navigation capabilities, including overflow and text truncation support, plus the improved zoomIntoView behavior. We hope these updates help you to build even more powerful plugins. For more details, click here.
