An addendum to Rule 3 regarding fan-translated works of things such as Web Novels has been made. Please see here for details.
We've issued a clarification on our policy on AI-generated work.
Our mod selection process has completed. Please welcome our new moderators.
The rules regarding NSFW links have been updated. See here for details.
Due to issues with external spam filters, QQ is currently unable to send any mail to Microsoft E-mail addresses. This includes any account at live.com, hotmail.com or msn.com. Signing up to the forum with one of these addresses will result in your verification E-mail never arriving. For best results, please use a different E-mail provider for your QQ address.
For prospective new members, a word of warning: don't use common names like Dennis, Simon, or Kenny if you decide to create an account. Spammers have used them all before you and gotten those names flagged in the anti-spam databases. Your account registration will be rejected because of it.
Since it has happened MULTIPLE times now, I want to be very clear about this. You do not get to abandon an account and create a new one. You do not get to pass an account to someone else and create a new one. If you do so anyway, you will be banned for creating sockpuppets.
Due to the actions of particularly persistent spammers and trolls, we will be banning disposable email addresses from today onward.

Reminds me of some excerpts from one of my favorite author on Fiction Live:

"This chain of causality binds all things. [...]"
Didn't want to ask in the thread, so, could I have a link to that fic? Or at least a name? Please and thank you!

Hey Troy first time writing an author on QQ but I really love Prince of Nothing and must know if it's a dead fic or on 'indefinate hiatus'. It's probably one of the best original stories I've read in a while. Anyway, thank you for giving us such a great story to read
