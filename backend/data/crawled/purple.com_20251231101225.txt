The first night we slept on it...all we could say was how amazing we felt! We both woke refreshed and to my excitement I had no backaches!!

It relieves every pressure point. It aligned my spine. It supports you, keeps you cool and alleviates pressure points without that sunken-in feeling.

I love this mattress! My chiropractor recommended it. I sleep well & wake without body pain. I also don't feel my spouse move which is a plus.
