Please contact us for further assistance. typeracer – the global typing competition Increase your typing speed while racing against others The award-winning online typing competition, TypeRacer, is the best free typing
  game in the world.
  It is the first-ever multiplayer typing game, which lets you race against real people typing quotes from books,
  movies, and songs. Your typing speed will improve by at least 10 WPM if you play this free game at least once a week. TypeRacer is much
  more fun than just a free typing test.
  It's better to practice typing on typeracer.com than any free typing program
  or typing tutor. The consensus is clear: among computer typing games, TypeRacer is king! Don't wait to get started: the road to becoming a touch typing master is long, but at least TypeRacer makes it fun and
  easy. To be clear, TypeRacer is not an easy typing game, but it will actually make you a better typist than those easy
  typing games for kids. It makes you type the same sort of text you would see at typing jobs. Don't know how to type yet? Then learn to type! Just grab a free typing tutor or read a free typing tutorial. There
  are many free typing lessons on the web. You can also just download Mavis Beacon if you prefer. Once you've mastered your basic typing skills, use TypeRacer for your first real timed typing test. Then just keep
  practicing - you will improve your typing speed fast! Already know how to type? Then just have fun! TypeRacer is one of the best free online games, so why play any other
  addicting games which don't improve your typing speed in the process? You can quit those other computer games, flash
  games, facebook games, and kids games, and get focused on TypeRacer: the game that is actually good for you! You must have Javascript enabled in your browser in order to play
