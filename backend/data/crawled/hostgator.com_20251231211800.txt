Got questions?
Well, we’ve got answers.
What is web hosting and do I need it?

Every website takes up space on a physical server somewhere. Web hosting stores those files and makes your site’s content accessible to people online.

Learn more about what web hosting is, why you need it, and what options may be right for you.

What type of web hosting do I need?

It all depends on the needs of your site. For beginners and smaller sites, shared hosting is probably just right. For those who need more control, VPS or dedicated hosting is likely a better option.

Learn about the different hosting options available, and see which one is a good fit.

What’s the difference between web hosting and a website builder?

While web hosting is providing and maintaining servers, a website builder is a software tool that makes creating your website easy and effective.

Get more info on the differences, and see if you need a builder to create your site.

What is WordPress?

As the most popular tool to create websites, it’s a content management system (CMS) that develops various types of websites.

See the benefits of building with WordPress and decide for yourself if it’s the right call for you.

How can I transfer my domain to HostGator?

We’ve set up a complete guide on how to transfer your domain, including what you need to do beforehand, how to get it started, how to check its status, and any troubleshooting notes.
