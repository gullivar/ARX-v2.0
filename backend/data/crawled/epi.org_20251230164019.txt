Unequal Power
Shattering the myth of equal power in the workplace. Unequal power

We envision an economy that is just and strong, sustainable, and equitable--where every job is good, every worker can join a union, and every family and community can thrive.

EPI is a leader in the movement for economic justice. We use the tools of economics to win policy change that advances power for workers, economic security for families, and racial and gender equity in our nation.

EPI's rigorous research and transformative ideas fortify worker organizing, build a shared understanding of how power and policy shape economic outcomes, and drive progressive policy change at every level of government.
