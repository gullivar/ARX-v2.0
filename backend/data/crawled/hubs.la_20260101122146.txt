Unfortunately, automated scanning is not perfect and will occasionally flag content or activity that is perfectly fine. When that occurs, we rely on our human content moderation specialists for a second review and approval. In addition to our automated detection efforts, we review reports from employees, partners, customers, and third parties regarding unsolicited or abusive content, as well as customer content that promotes, encourages, or facilitates illegal activity, hate speech, violence, or discrimination. These reviews are done by humans and are further described in our Content Moderation @ HubSpot statement .

For a list of restricted industries at HubSpot, please refer to Section 7 of HubSpot's Acceptable Use Policy . What is the DMCA? The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States law that provides a framework for addressing copyright infringement on the internet. It establishes procedures for copyright owners to request the removal of infringing content and outlines the responsibilities and protections for online service providers such as HubSpot. What is a DMCA takedown request? A DMCA takedown request is a formal notice sent by a copyright owner (or their authorized agent) to HubSpot, alleging that specific content hosted or linked by HubSpot infringes their copyright. The request asks HubSpot to remove or disable access to the infringing material. What information must be included in a DMCA takedown request or counter-notice? For a complete list of information needed for DMCA notices and/or counter-notices, please refer to the Claims of Copyright Infringement section of HubSpot's Website Terms of Use. What does HubSpot do upon receiving a DMCA takedown request? Upon receiving a valid DMCA takedown request, HubSpot promptly removes or disables access to the allegedly infringing material, notifies the user who posted the material that it has been removed or disabled, and maintains records of the takedown request and actions taken. What is a DMCA counter-notice? A DMCA counter-notice is a formal response submitted by the user whose content was removed, asserting that the material was removed in error or misidentification. The counter-notice requests the restoration of the content. What does HubSpot do upon receiving a counter-notice? Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, HubSpot notifies the original complainant of the counter-notice and restores the removed material within 10-14 business days unless the complainant files a lawsuit seeking a court order to keep the material down. Is HubSpot required to monitor user content? No, the DMCA does not require HubSpot to proactively monitor or seek out infringing content. However, it must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to infringing material upon receiving a valid takedown notice. Disclaimer: this FAQ is intended to provide general information about DMCA procedures and obligations. For specific legal advice, consult a qualified attorney.
