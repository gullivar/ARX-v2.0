We're helping to make global payment data secure
Certified: ISO/IEC 27001:2022
Our powerful app protection products make your app or SDK safe to use in a world full of fast-shifting cyber threats.
Interconnected layers of protection interact closely with both the app and the operating system. Together they form a solid shield against damaging attacks.
Code and resource hardening

The act of obfuscating, encrypting, virtualizing, and isolating your app’s code and resources.

Secure runtime environment

RASP checks to make sure your app isn’t exposed to harmful threats in its environment.

Secure network communications

SSL pinning and certificate transparency to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Application integrity

Dynamic cryptographic key calculations at runtime stop your app from working if it has been tampered with.

Our layers of app security provide unbeatable protection against a variety of threats.
Static attacks

Bad actors will try to decompile your app to examine its code, reverse engineer its logic, discover vulnerabilities to exploit, and design malware to target it. Our products use encryption, obfuscation, and virtualization to make the decompiled code impossible to understand.

Dynamic attacks

These days, most reverse engineering attempts are dynamic and take place during runtime execution. Our products use Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) which spots dynamic instrumentation tools like Frida and dangerous mobile malware. Then it stops them from working.

Network-based attacks

If the communication channel between your app and the server isn’t protected, it can be targeted. And sensitive data and assets can then be stolen. Our products secure this channel, keeping your app safe from man-in-the-middle attacks and preventing data being funnelled to a bogus server.

The state of mobile app security report

In recent years our mobile phone usage has evolved dramatically. We’re asking more and more of everyday mobile apps, but are they as secure as we need them to be?

A guide to mobile application protection

Attacks against mobile apps are getting more dangerous. To defend against them you need to know how and why attackers target them and what you can do to stop them succeeding.
