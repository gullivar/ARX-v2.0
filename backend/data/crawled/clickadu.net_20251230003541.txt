Banner ads

Banner ad is a traditional (and the most Google-friendly) display ad format which looks like a commercial image or an animation appearing on a web page. Available in two sizes: 300х250, 300х100 and 728x90. Choose it to promote your product/offer to get misclick protection, multicreative tool and wide selection of GEOs. And enjoy high CPM rates and 100% fillrate when monetizing your website.

Our partners' feedback

Really responsible and pleasant partners! We like working with the Clickadu team because you can feel their professionalism – the guys are friendly and competent. Timely feedback and prompt launch of new tests, thanks to which we have reached really profitable heights together. We are working win-win and plan to continue!

Anastasia Getsovich (Zeydoo)

As you know we have been working together for more than 2 or 3 years now and it was always amazing working with the Сlickadu team. We worked on many categories and Geos not limited to India like games, e-comm, Apps, and many more and I am confident to say that we did great these days and hope we will achieve new heights in future.

Appmontize Media

Clickadu has been one of our trusted Network partners for years now. The team is highly professional and responsive, and the quality of traffic has always met our requirements.

Daraz Team

Clickadu is collaborative and highly experienced. Thanks to their active support and optimization, we consistently receive an impressive app traffic amount to help us achieve our goals.

Shopee TH team

Clickadu is an interesting ad network because they have 6 different ad formats you can try. For example, if you want to test out banners, they had 300x250 and 300x100 banner slots. Affiliates should be testing these! I like Clickadu and you should too

Luke Kling (affLift Forum)

We have been business partners for years and Clickadu is one of our favorite traffic platforms. They not only provide a high amount of traffic at fair rates, but the customer support is also professional and responsive all the time.

Mobvista team

Clickadu is definitely one of the most-recommended traffic networks by affiliates that have run affiliate campaigns there! Many ad formats + many targeting options + sizeable inventory = worth a test if you haven't!
