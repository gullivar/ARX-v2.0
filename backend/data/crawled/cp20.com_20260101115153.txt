Campaigner® Email Marketing Software Something went wrong. Perhaps we can help. Campaigner® is an email service provider, and email sent from comes from our subscribers. So we’re guessing a Campaigner subscriber sent you a message with this link in it. Sorry for any trouble this caused you. Sometimes this issue is caused by the email client that you're using or other software you have installed such as antivirus software. You could try clicking on the link again or opening the email on another device and clicking on it there. Otherwise, please contact support@campaigner.com anytime. If you clicked on this link because you wanted to unsubscribe from the email, or if you would like to report it as unsolicited, please forward the original message to us at postmaster@campaigner.com , and we will handle it right away. (Please forward the entire message, including the headers, and add a short note explaining the problem.) Campaigner is a founder and member of the Email Sender & Provider Coalition — an organization designed to combat the proliferation of spam. So we take extremely seriously the sending practices of our subscribers — and we demand that they practice permission-based email marketing. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience. —The Campaigner Team © 2025 Ziff Davis. All rights reserved. Campaigner ® is a trademark of Ziff Davis and its affiliates.
