I can’t do this algorithmic timeline garbage anymore.

Give me information goddammit https://t.co/WEwKkbwHva Joel @Jovies007 I don’t know how I managed to live without an RSS Reader until this week. Inoreader helped me stay up to date with all the news and articles I needed without having to open the browser and dealing with the design choices of every website that I visit. Laura Gibbs @OnlineCrsLady single most important tool in my toolbox is @Inoreader ... best premium feature for me is rules that automatically apply tags to incoming blog posts from students; it helps me display different streams of student work, as here in Canvas:

YAY INOREADER! :-) https://t.co/U6mwYOUXCR Matt Cholick @cholick Just recently discovered my RSS reader (Inoreader) can receive email newsletters and mix them in with the rest of my feeds. So useful. It's time to go on an unsubscribe spree; the inbox was never where I wanted these things. Mark Vanderbeeken @vanderbeeken If you don’t want to rely on algorithm defined news timelines, consider good old-fashioned rss feeds. 
@inoreader is definitely the best reader out there at the moment. 
I definitely recommend this freemium product from Innologica, a small innovative company in Bulgaria. Michael Young @myoung @kimjimenez @digg I switched to Inoreader after we shut digg reader (sorry!). Colin Madland 🇺🇦🇮🇷 @colinmadland @amichetti @jbj I didn’t use google reader, but quite enjoy @Inoreader and pay for the upgrade. I’m happy to pay a few bucks for tools that don’t suck. @ [email protected] @GvnCampbell If you are an RSS feed power user @Inoreader’s web feeds feature is invaluable for those sites that don’t have an RSS feed. Jeff Strommen 💪🏼 Think Wellness @JStrommen @warwickabrown @Inoreader Inoreader is THE best reader. You’re in control of the content. Can’t say enough about how @inoreader keeps me up to speed on topics and trends from sources I choose. I get no kickbacks for recommending the 🏆Pro sub. It’s better than Feedly and can curate Flipboard mags. Build your own newsfeed Ready to give it a go? Start a 14-day trial, no credit card required.
