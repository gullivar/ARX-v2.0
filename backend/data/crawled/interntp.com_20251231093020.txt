CNAME Cross-User Banned
What happened?

You've requested a page on a website that is part of the Cloudflare network. The host is configured as a CNAME across accounts on Cloudflare, which is not allowed by Cloudflare's security policy.

Please see https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-1xxx-errors/error-1014/ for more details.

What can I do?

If this is an R2 custom domain, it may still be initializing. If you have attempted to manually point a CNAME DNS record to your R2 bucket, you must do it using a custom domain. Refer to R2's documentation for details.
