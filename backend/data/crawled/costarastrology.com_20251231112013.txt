WHAT IS THIS

Access to astrology this accurate has historically been restricted to those with access to personal astrologers—now these predictions can be anyone's.

Our powerful natural-language engine uses NASA data, coupled with the methods of professional astrologers, to algorithmically generate insights about who you are and how you relate to others.

Astrology puts our temporary bodies in context with our universe's vastness, allowing irrationality to invade our techno-rationalist ways of living.

Understand your birth chart

Unlike the broad and vague magazine horoscopes that only use your sun sign, we use a complete picture of the sky when and where you were born to generate your full birth chart.
