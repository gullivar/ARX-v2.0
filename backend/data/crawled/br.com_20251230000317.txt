Why choose .BR.COM?
UNMATCHED AVAILABILITY – A TRUE LANDRUSH OPPORTUNITY

While there are over 5 million .com.br domains registered, fewer than 5,000 .BR.COM domains exist, making .BR.COM an exciting new space with premium names still available. This is a rare opportunity to secure powerful, brandable names in an unrestricted namespace.

GLOBAL TRUST, LOCAL IMPACT

Leverage the credibility of .COM with the local relevance of Brazil. Whether you’re a Brazilian company expanding internationally or a global brand entering Brazil, .BR.COM builds trust with customers and search engines alike.

SEO & MARKET VISIBILITY

Our intent with .BR.COM is to be search engine-friendly by providing an unrestricted .COM variant specifically targeted towards Brazil. .BR.COM offers a localized yet globally accessible domain choice without the centralized red tape of other regional options.

UNRESTRICTED & DECENTRALIZED

The internet should be free and open. Unlike .com.br domains, which are regulated by local authorities, .BR.COM is managed independently, allowing businesses and individuals to establish their presence without unnecessary red tape.

GLOBAL RELAUNCH WITH LEADING REGISTRARS

Although .BR.COM has been established for over a decade, its global relaunch through GoDaddy and Namecheap is set to propel it to new heights, making it easier than ever to secure your domain and reach a worldwide audience.

.BR.COM – The unrestricted digital frontier

The internet was built on the idea of open, decentralized access—where anyone, anywhere, could claim their space online. .BR.COM is the unrestricted domain for Brazil, offering businesses, entrepreneurs, and global brands a powerful digital identity without limitations. Whether you're a startup, an established company, or an investor looking for a premium web presence, .BR.COM gives you the freedom to connect with Brazil while maintaining international reach.

Unlike country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) like .com.br, which require local presence and regulatory approval, .BR.COM is open to everyone. This is the domain extension that embodies the original vision of internet pioneer Jon Postel—a truly global, decentralized namespace where businesses and individuals can establish their presence without artificial restrictions.

.BR.COM operates independently and has no affiliation with the Brazilian government, .BR or .COM. We are an autonomous entity providing an unrestricted and globally accessible domain space.

.BR.COM vs. Other Brazilian Domain Options

With .BR.COM, you don’t have to choose between global reach and Brazilian relevance—you get both.

*The assessment of availability takes into account both (1) the number of unavailable names and (2) applicable registration restrictions.

Today, .BR.COM brings that vision to life for the Brazilian market by offering a powerful alternative to restricted domain spaces. It’s time to break free from outdated limitations and embrace a domain that gives you the freedom to grow.
