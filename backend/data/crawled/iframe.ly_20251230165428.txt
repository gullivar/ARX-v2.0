Interactives

All onboard

We love and care for all publishers, big and small, most popular and the longer tail alike. You get it maintenance-free, leaving you what you do best — your app and content.

Data

Same API

Instead of thousands of publisher APIs, Iframely gives you a single endpoint to connect to and get all the data, today and tomorrow.

Delivery

Everywhere you code

React, AMP or your regular CMS or JavaScript front-end. We fix publisher’s issues and make sure the media works where you need it most — on all your users’ devices.

<amp-iframely height="140"
  data-url="https://iframely.com"

  resizable>
</amp-iframely>
useEffect(() => {
  window.iframely && iframely.load();
});
return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={getIframelyHtml()} />;
