What Is The Grammy Organization?

We are a movement powered by 30,000 active songwriters, performers, producers, and industry professionals who serve the music community by lifting their voices on a global stage, protecting their rights, creating opportunities for advancement, and providing direct assistance when it is needed most. And through the Grammy Award, we honor the very best of what music gives us each year.
