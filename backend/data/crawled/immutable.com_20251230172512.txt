Most games fail at launch

95% of funded games never reach $1m in revenue

More games than ever are competing for players

Player growth has stalled while new game releases are at record highs

Wishlists are cold and uncontactable 

Games invest huge dollars in pre-launch wishlists that don’t convert

Players are anonymous and impossible to value

No ability to segment, target, or retain your players pre-launch

Immutable transforms anonymous users into high value players
