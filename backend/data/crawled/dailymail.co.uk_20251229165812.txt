The great retreat: Up to a million Romanians came to the UK to work as cleaners and builders... now nearly 40,000 are leaving each year to escape crime, the crumbling NHS and cost of living
Looking out on yet another miserable rainy day and realising that the cost of livinghad soared yet again, Alexandra Stamate knew that her family's future did not lie in the UK. With every month proving a struggle to make ends meet in Bristol, she and her Uber driver husband decided that they had to leave with their three children. The couple, who emigrated to Britain in search of a better life, ended up joining a growing exodus of their fellow Romanians who have returned to their homeland in recent years.

'I don't want people who hate our country coming here': Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's fury as Keir Starmer welcomes freed anti-Semitic Egyptian dissident who called for the killing of British police
Writing in the Daily Mail, the Tory leader says Alaa Abd El-Fattah - whose arrival in the UK was celebrated by Keir Starmer- should be stripped of his dual British nationality and booted out. It follows the emergence of vile social media posts in which El-Fattah advocated the murder of Jews and boasted of his hatred for white people, saying: 'I seriously, seriously, seriously hate white people, especially those of English or Dutchor German descent.'

A toxic family drama, the Scottish Widows bride, and how Posh turned Holly Ramsay and Adam Peaty's wedding into her own catwalk
VICTORIA MOSS: The white, hooded cloak that swamped Holly Ramsay must have felt like a fabulous idea for a winter wedding, yet it looked more Scottish Widows than luxury cover up. With so much anticipation around this winter wedding, I'm surely not the only one to have been disappointed not to see the actual dress. And I did wonder if her 'something blue' might be just the mood towards her new (but uninvited) in-laws?

Brigitte Bardot was the woman so alluring the term 'sex kitten' was coined just for her... but who turned her back on men, movies and motherhood to become a firebrand animal rights activist
BRIAN VINER: Bardot. There aren't many surnames entirely synonymous with sexual allure, but in the 1950s there were two. The other was Monroe, another powerfully evocative six-letter name, but I would argue Brigitte Bardot had a global impact, on men and women alike, that was unmatched even by Marilyn Monroe and all the fanfare of Hollywood. The 1956 French-language film And God Created Woman made her not merely a star but an international sensation. And her appeal transcended the generation gap, too. In 1967 she was invited to meet the French president Charles de Gaulle at the Elysée Palace, where women were banned from wearing trousers as evening wear.

It was billed as a modern take on Billie Jean King's 1973 Battle of the Sexes victory against Bobby Riggs at the Houston Astrodome. But the match between Belarus's Aryna Sabalenka and Australia's Nick Kyrgios failed to live up to the hype - as the women's world number one lost out to the men's 671st ranked player on Sunday. The event at the 17,000-seater Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai was in stark contrast to Ms King's famous win which changed the course of women's tennis.

The extraordinary story of Hercules, the 65-stone grizzly raised 'like a son' by a Scottish wrestler who fed him fry-ups and Babycham in the local pub
There are endless stories from the 1970s and 80s that shock and amaze us today. Because, as we all know, things were a bit different back then. But, surely, the menage-a-trois (of sorts) between Maggie and Andy Robin, a couple from Clackmannanshire, Scotland, and Hercules, the 9ft, 65st grizzly bear who lived with them for 25 years, ate fry-ups for breakfast at the kitchen table, lounged in front of the fire, and drank buckets of beer with punters in the pub they ran, takes the biscuit. 'It was a love story between the three of us, a definite love story,' says Maggie, now 76. No one's lived like that with a bear before. He was our wee boy.'

The UK's most mysterious missing person cases: From the boy, 3, who vanished while playing in garden, to the two men who disappeared five years apart after boarding a ferry in Portsmouth
A staggering 160,000 people are reported missing every year in the UK - equating to one person every 90 seconds. Of these, over 88,000 are adults and nearly 72,000 are children - although this is likely to be a significant underestimate of actual figures. And while missing persons often make it home safe, a minority never do, creating anguish for grieving families as they are left with so many unanswered questions and very little closure.
