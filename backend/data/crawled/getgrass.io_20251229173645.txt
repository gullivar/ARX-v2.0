Grass Works In The Background Of Your Life While You Earn Rewards
 .
Why It Matters
You pay for internet every month. But most of it goes unused,
doing nothing for you. Grass puts the unused part of your
connection to work, and turns it into rewards. It's a resource
you've always had. Now it works for you.
How It Works
LEARN MORE
In just three clicks, you can install the app and automatically earn by sharing
the unused part of your internet connection with verified institutions.
Your participation is tracked through Grass Points, which help determine how
many Grass Token rewards you receive over time. Grass cannot see your
personal data or online activity — only the unused part of your connection
is ever shared.
Why People Trust It
Privacy
Security
Control
You are in control. Grass is made for you to share your unused
bandwidth, nothing more. With Grass, no one, not even us, can
access your private information or view your personal online
activity. Regularly audited and constantly monitored, Grass is
recognized as safe to use by all of the leading antivirus providers.

Grass is built with your privacy in mind and designed
to stay out of your way.
