Linux Vendor Firmware Service

The Linux Vendor Firmware Service is a secure portal which allows hardware vendors to upload firmware updates.

This site is used by all major Linux distributions to provide metadata for clients such as fwupdmgr and GNOME Software.

There is no charge to vendors for the hosting or distribution of content. Consulting companies can offer advice and help you get on the LVFS.

Hardware Vendors

Hardware vendors upload redistributable firmware to the LVFS site packaged up in an industry-standard .cab archive along with a Linux-specific metadata file.
