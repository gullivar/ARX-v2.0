FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
WHO IS THAT ANIMAL ON YOUR SITE? AND WHAT IS IT?

Ah, the age-old question that’s split our team Slack for years. Dolphin? Whale? Narwhal in disguise? We’ll let you decide. Either way—that’s Captain Cues, and he represents three things at the heart of Appcues:
‍
• Our culture – authentic, positive, and unapologetically weird.
‍• Our expertise – helping businesses deliver experiences that actually drive growth.
‍• Our commitment to your success – steering you toward wins with Appcues.

The debate will rage on, but Captain Cues is far too busy making waves to care.

WHAT KINDS OF MOMENTS CAN APPCUES HELP WITH?

Every moment that matters—onboarding milestones, key feature launches, expansion triggers, and re-engagement opportunities. Appcues helps you design experiences around these points so customers keep moving toward success.

WHAT WILL MY TEAM ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO ONCE WE HAVE APPCUES?

Build and launch in-app, email, and push experiences from one platform—whether it’s an onboarding checklist, a feature announcement, or a renewal prompt. Target them to the users and moments that matter, and adjust as you learn what works.

WE’VE TRIED TOOLS LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THEY DIDN’T WORK. HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT?

Most tools focus on surface-level nudges or a single channel. Appcues is built for the high-impact parts of the journey—activation, adoption, and expansion—and for teams who want a clearer connection between engagement and business outcomes.

HOW WILL I SEE IF IT’S HELPING RETENTION OR EXPANSION?

Appcues shows you how each experience performs—like completion rates or click-throughs—and how those interactions relate to core product events. You can see whether a message drives the behaviors you care about, and push that data to tools like Amplitude or Salesforce for deeper analysis.

DOES THIS REPLACE MY CSMS OR MARKETERS?

No—it makes them more effective. Digital experiences handle predictable, repeatable parts of the journey so your team can focus on moments that need a human touch.

WILL IT WORK WITH OUR CURRENT TOOLS AND DATA?

Yes. Appcues connects to Salesforce, HubSpot, Segment, Amplitude, and more, so you can use the data you already have to target experiences and keep reporting unified.

DO WE NEED TO OVERHAUL OUR PROCESSES BEFORE STARTING?

Not at all. Many teams start with a single high-impact opportunity—like rescuing stalled onboarding—and expand from there, refining both the process and the experiences along the way.

Enterprise-ready from day one

Security, scale, and support you can count on.
