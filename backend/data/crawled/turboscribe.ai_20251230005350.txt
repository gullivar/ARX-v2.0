I rarely leave testimonials, but this app 100% deserved one in my books. TurboScribe has been such a game-changer for me. I used to pick and choose what to transcribe due to time it took to upload BUT mostly due to cost. I'm transcribing all sorts of business interactions—meetings, calls, videos, you name it.

Since switching to TurboScribe - I transcribe everything without thinking. Large numbers of small files or several HUGE files it handles it. It saved me money, enabled me to offer more services and a TON of time. My once a year review is done, but I feel Turboscribe deserves is hands down.

I formerly had students transcribe audios (8 hrs. work for 1 hr. audio). Your program is literally saving me thousands of hours. The accuracy is actually better than when I had human help doing it. Yours is an incredibly useful piece of software.

Of all the services we tested, TurboScribe offers the best results. Its most meticulous AI model generated a clear and accurate text... Equally reliable, the free version allows up to three transcriptions per day of thirty minutes each.

I used this for one of my university assessments today and it's absolutely killer. Hope your business grows because it's excellent. We even had three different accents in our group and your service straight up nailed it.

Yesterday I stumbled upon ingenious tool: https://turboscribe.ai

Subtitles for videos in over 130 languages in super quality. So all my future videos will have at least English subtitles. And also some older videos.

For example, my #ChatGPT course is getting an upgrade where I'm adding English subtitles to all videos.

I've been searching for what seems like centuries, for a piece of transcription software that delivers with accuracy! TurboScribe IS THAT SOFTWARE.

Not only does it transcribe with amazing accuracy, it also filters out a ton of the unnecessary noise associated with pauses in audio. On top of that, it performs to perfection with the built in ChatGPT prompts (this was another area I was previously struggling with).

I used to farm out transcripts to be completed manually since I was unable to find an AI solution that met my needs. Less than 1 month into my subscription and I've done away with farming out transcriptions completely; it's much more cost effective and efficient to do them in house with TurboScribe. Keep up the great work!

Easily the best AI transcription service I've used. Intuitive, quick, and super helpful features for anyone with a high volume workload.

Which audio / video formats do you support?

TurboScribe supports the vast majority of common audio and video formats, including MP3, M4A, MP4, MOV, AAC, WAV, OGG, OPUS, MPEG, WMA, WMV, AVI, FLAC, AIFF, ALAC, 3GP, MKV, WEBM, VOB, RMVB, MTS, TS, QuickTime, and DivX.

Can I export my transcript?

You can also export multiple files at the same time with Bulk Actions.

Which languages do you support?

TurboScribe converts speech to text in over 98 languages using the highest accuracy AI transcription technology.

Languages like English are the most accurate, typically with human levels of performance and strong recognition of specialized, domain-specific vocabulary. Voice to text accuracy varies by language. You'll get the best results in the following languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Polish, Turkish, Hebrew, Greek, Czech, Vietnamese, and Korean. You are encouraged to use the free tier to experiment.

What about accents, background noise, and poor audio quality?

While clean and clear audio produces the best results, TurboScribe generally does well with accents, background noise, and lower audio quality.

If you're transcribing files with very poor audio quality, TurboScribe has a built-in audio restoration tool. It can be enabled via the "Restore Audio" option (under "More Settings") when uploading a file. This uses AI to remove background noise and enhance human speech. Audio restoration takes an extra 2-3 minutes per hour of audio/video.

How do I label speakers in my transcript?

Speaker recognition can be enabled via the "Speaker Recognition" checkbox (under "More Settings") when uploading files. It will take an extra minute or two (per hour of audio) to create a transcript labeled with speakers.

Can I translate transcripts and subtitles to other languages?

Yes! You can translate transcripts or subtitles to more than 130 languages. Click the "Translate" button when viewing any transcript to open the Translation Tool. Then select your desired language and file format to download a translated transcript or subtitles.

You can also transcribe audio or video files (in any language) directly to English by selecting "Transcribe to English" under "More Settings" when uploading files.

How much can I transcribe?

We don't have caps on overall usage and our systems are designed to enable you to transcribe at least 720 hours of audio or video per month.

That means you could use TurboScribe to transcribe your entire life (24 hours per day x 30 days per month = 720 hours, or 43,200 minutes)! As one customer said, "I transcribe everything without thinking."

If you're transcribing very high volumes (more than 720 hours per month, or top 0.1% of usage), we wrote up a helpful guide to help you get the most out of TurboScribe.

How do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription at any time by clicking "Account Settings" and then "Manage Subscription". You'll have full access to TurboScribe through the end of the current billing period.

Who is behind TurboScribe?
