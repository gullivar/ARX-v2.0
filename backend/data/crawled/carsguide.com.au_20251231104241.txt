And a 2.2L 2.2-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine – with an eight-speed automatic transmission and idle stop-start technology – is now the brand's entry-level offering in its 4WD wagon line-up. This new MU-X has the same 3.5 tonne towing capacity as its 3.0-litre stablemate and it offers better claimed fuel consumption than the 3.0L.
