The Cutting Room Floor is a site dedicated to unearthing and researching unused and cut content from video games. From debug menus, to unused music, graphics, enemies, or levels, many games have content never meant to be seen by anybody but the developers — or even meant for everybody, but cut due to time/budget constraints. Feel free to browse our collection of games and start reading. Up for research? Try looking at some stubs and see if you can help us out. Just have some faint memory of some unused menu/level you saw years ago but can't remember how to access it? Feel free to start a page with what you saw and we'll take a look.

Featured Article Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Developer: Nintendo , Intelligent Systems Publisher: Nintendo Released: 2004, GameCube Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the sequel to the original Paper Mario game, which was released for the GameCube. As big as the success was with the previous game, the follow-up is considered to be the best of the spin-off franchise by fans, due to it expanding on what was settled in the original such as bigger maps, improved graphics and details and a brand new post-game quest. The game has appeared to have undergone a wealth of balance changes and scrapped enemies, along with some unused characters and items that never appear in the final game! There's also a bunch of overlooked and unseen oddities, considering the amount of detail this game had received during development. Read more... All Featured Blurbs All Featured Articles Suggestions?

Check it out! Suggestions? Featured File Super Mario Kart is a wacky SNES racing game featuring Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and many other characters from the Mario universe. This classic was the beginning of the Mario Kart series that started more or less the whole trend of "Mascot Racers". In the Japanese version, Bowser's and Princess Peach's victory animations depict them drinking champagne. Nintendo of America's policies at the time did not allow depictions of drinking in games, so the animations had to be changed accordingly. These changes were kept for the European release. Bowser's victory pose originally showed him chugging the champagne. He just poses happily with it in the international versions. In the Japanese version, Princess Peach daintily sips her champagne, although the shading on her face says she might already be drunk. In the international versions, she tosses it in the air.
