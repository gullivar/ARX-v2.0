Understanding a Corporate Filings LLC Charge You may see our name on your credit card or bank statement if you: Formed a business with the Secretary of State Purchased a registered agent service Filed a state report or business renewal Ordered a business address, mail forwarding, or similar service Even if the business name you ordered from doesn’t appear on your statement, this charge is valid and was securely processed through us. Why You Shouldn’t Dispute the Charge Disputing a valid charge can create a long hold on the money, sometimes for months, while your bank, card company, and our team review the transaction.

We’ll quickly verify the charge and connect you with the company that provided your service. Contact Us If you’re unsure about a charge, our U.S.-based support team is ready to help.
