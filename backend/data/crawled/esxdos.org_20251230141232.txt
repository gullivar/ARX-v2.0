DivIDE: Supports HDD/CDROM/ZIP/LS120 devices
DivMMC: Supports MMC/SD/SDHC devices
Device and filesystem abstraction layer
Full FAT16/FAT32 read/write support (no extended partitions, no LFN).
Virtual Disk support (up to 4 devices)
Betadisk/TR-DOS emulation using (trimmed) .TRD files
Provides extended BASIC commands
BASIC files integration using +3DOS headers for FAT filesystems
Support for seamless IM2 loading/saving, from BASIC and machine code
System commands loaded from /BIN dir of system drive
TAPE emulator supports reading/writing from/to TAP files. TAP attaching functions are available to external programs.
POSIX-based API usable by .commands, external programs and NMI.SYS. Functions available on rst $08:
open, read, write, close, opendir, readdir, seek, sync, fstat, getcwd, chdir, unlink...
Possibility of getting absolute LBA sector and device on an opened file (for direct I/O)
Kernel loads modules (.KO files) on demand
NMI.SYS support (NMI system is independent, ESXDOS kernel just provides services)
