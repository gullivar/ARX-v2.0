AI observability

Monitor every agent’s performance, session behavior, cost, and operational metrics to prevent issues.

AI guardrails

Enforce safety and quality messages by intercepting, modifying, or blocking prompts and responses.

AI security & compliance

Dedicated insight into your AI stack’s risk posture with security-focused dashboards and evaluators.

See what users think about Coralogix
Our customers

“The alerts and the dashboards that we were able to fine-tune before the event meant that we caught all the problems before anything happened. That was critical for the success of our customers’ constant engagement with their fans.”

“There are some cities in the U.S. where people can’t get to work if Via isn’t operational. I love that Coralogix allows me to work with my open source tooling.”

“The main reason that I would recommend Coralogix is the amazing support. They communicate with their clients to understand exactly what their issues and pain points are so that they can innovate to address them”
