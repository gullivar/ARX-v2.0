Kill Cliff "STOQ is a must-have for your store. It not only provides a great feature but it also recovers sales for you and should pay for itself. Support is friendly and easy to talk to, and FAST! Great app and great team behind it!" SwitchButtons, USA “I have been using this App on Multiple Stores for about 8 months and have been waiting to leave a review until I had fully tested it. And it is better than any Back In stock App I have used before, and I tested a few and this is really miles better.” B2B CA, Canada “If I could give them 6 stars, I would! Anaam and the team at Stoq have been incredibly helpful and made my migration super simple. This app started generating pre-order sales immediately and has already proven its worth. I highly recommend Stoq for your Shopify store.” Axeman.ca, Canada This is one of the best apps we’ve discovered recently. The preorder feature is exactly what we needed. Installation was seamless, and any theme-integration hiccups were resolved within minutes—or a few hours at most—by their fantastic support team. Alpine Nation Outdoor Clothing, Canada The team behind 'Preorder, Back In Stock ‑ Stoq' has been fantastic to work with. They were incredibly helpful and responsive, quickly assisting me with the setup of the app and making sure it was customized exactly to fit my store’s needs." Downtown Distillery UK, United Kingdom Great app with fantastic support. They helped us configure a custom restock notification button on our custom theme. An intuitive admin with awesome features. Highest recommendations for this app! Garrett Leight, USA Used this for our first preorder and it worked great. Love the out of stock notifications as well. The app tags every preorder which you can use to route them through a different import process. PowerBlock, USA Downloaded in a panic as another app was unresponsive during a critical time and this app has been amazing! I had an issue setting it up but Sneha at support was so diligent and efficient. It was amazing to communicate with and get my pre-order product up. Unndr, USA Great app, intuitive and easy to setup. Amazing customer service as well- very responsive and helpful! DIBS Beauty, USA It's a huge upgrade on the previous app we were using and the support team is honestly the best we've come across anywhere Mount Kiwi, New Zealand FAQ’s Got questions?
