Bubble gives people the opportunity to make their ideas come to life really quickly. Before, you'd be looking at trying to pay somebody $10,000 or more. Bubble gives you control. I love that I can sit down and build something the way I think it should be built.

Bubble is the best no-code platform, and it has the most capability of any platform I've ever tried. Trust me, I've tried all of them. It's really a game changer. If you're going to go no-code, start with Bubble. You won't regret it.

The biggest surprise is that I was able to build this AI-led mediation function in eight weeks. In my head, that was going to be a year-long process, at least. There's no Wizard of Oz behind the scenes. It works. It works well.

Real impact, no code: hear from the Bubble community
Blown away by Bubble's AI assistant upgrade - your #nocode app from a single prompt! 🤯 Friday: apps looking tragic. Today: stunning! Whatever the @bubble team did over the weekend deserves major props! #NoCode #AI #GenAI

Turns out, spending way too much time on Bubble has its perks...

I'm officially a @bubble Ambassador! 🎉

Bubble has changed my life, and I’m excited to give back even more to this amazing community. Whether you're a founder, a Bubble developer, or just curious, let’s connect!

AI coding still requires coding.

If you are not committed to becoming good at coding, then don't bother with these tools.

Bubble is miles easier to learn and can build the strong majority of app ideas that most people have.

It's worth repeating: @Bubble has the unambiguously best community. A prime example of that is #devday, which is an incredible community-organized event of community members doing technical talks on all kinds of incredible topics.
