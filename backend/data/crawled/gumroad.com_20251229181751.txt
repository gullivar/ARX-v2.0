The amount of income earned by Gumroad digital entrepreneurs last week.

I launched MaxPacks as an experimental side gig; but within 2 years those Procreate brushes were earning more than my 6-figure salary in CG. Leaving in favor of Gumroad enabled me to explore other aspects of my art, develop new hobbies, and finally prioritize my personal life.

Sells Procreate brush packs

For years, I had a goal to develop 'passive' income streams, but struggled to make that a reality. Last year, I started selling informational products on Gumroad and since then have made $10k+ per month building products that I love.

Sells content tutorials

Originally, I took pre-orders for my Trend Reports on Gumroad. But I received... exactly $0. So I changed tactics: I made half of my report free, and the other half paid. Today, 99% of Trends.VC revenue is recurring in the form of annual and quarterly subscriptions.

Sells business insights and expertise

I love Gumroad because it can't be any simpler. I upload a file, set a price, and I can start selling on the internet. The money I make from my sales lands directly in my bank account every Friday.
