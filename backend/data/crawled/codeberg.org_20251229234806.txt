NON-PROFIT

Codeberg is maintained by the non-profit organization Codeberg e.V., based in Berlin, Germany. For us, supporting the commons comes first.

Its future is in the hands of its users. You can help too!

COMMUNITY

We are more than just Git hosting: Our community is comprised of like-minded developers, artists, academics, hobbyists and professionals.

We celebrate free culture, openness and creativity.

RESPECT

No tracking. No third-party cookies. No profiteering. Everything runs on servers that we control. Your data is not for sale.
