Error Monitoring

Know what broke

and

why.

Rollbar shows you the moment something breaks, groups similar issues automatically, and helps you pinpoint the cause fast. With deep context, source control integration, and smart notifications, you’ll spend less time sifting and more time fixing.

Session Replay

See what

your

users saw.

Rollbar’s session replay lets you watch what actually happened in the browser, right next to the related errors. Rewind any user journey to understand how frontend issues unfolded, what triggered them, and how they affected your users.
