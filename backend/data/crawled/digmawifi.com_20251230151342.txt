Important Update: Streamlabs Link Space Is Being Discontinued

Mika Robinson

Read more by Mika Robinson

TL:DR Streamlabs Link Space will be discontinued on November 8, 2025. The tool will remain accessible for 30 days, giving you time to back up your links and transition to another service. This decision enables us to focus on developing and enhancing features that better support creators.

Support for Link Space Is Ending

We’ve made the difficult decision to discontinue Streamlabs Link Space so we can focus on building new tools and improving existing features that better serve creators’ needs. While the tool has been a helpful companion for many, we’re realigning our efforts toward tools that directly enhance live streaming and audience engagement. 

Link Space will remain available for the next 30 days, giving you time to export your data and transition to another bio link service. After November 8, you’ll no longer be able to access your Link Space dashboard or pages. We recommend saving your links (listed on your Link Space profile) and any useful analytics before that date.

What’s Next

Creators looking to keep a central link hub can explore other bio link services. You can also add your social links to your Streamlabs Tip Page and utilize it as your primary destination to drive support and engagement from your audience.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team.

We sincerely appreciate everyone who has used Link Space as part of their creator toolkit. Your continuous support helps us evolve and deliver the best tools for streamers everywhere.
