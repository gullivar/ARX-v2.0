Previous methods have relied on indirect proxies such as cash circulation or electricity usage, or on inferences based on highly structured macroeconomic models. This column by Francesco Pappadà  and Kenneth Rogoff  introduces a new, algorithmic and easily updateable approach to estimating informal activity in Europe, utilising VAT data and consumption surveys. While the approach works particularly well for Europe, it can in principle can be extended to other countries where value added taxes are a major source of revenue.
