‘I Was Just So Naïve’: Inside Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Break With Trump

29 MIN READ

Robert Draper

I’ve reported for the past two months on Marjorie Taylor Greene’s sudden isolation in Congress and her decision to resign from her House seat after President Trump called her a “traitor.” She spoke with me in two on-the-record interviews that were remarkably candid.

Robert Draper

Greene told me that the death of Charlie Kirk was clarifying for her. She watched Kirk’s widow, Erika, speak at his memorial about love and forgiveness, and then watched Trump follow her speech with one in which he said, “I hate my opponent.”

Robert Draper

Greene arrived in Congress in 2021 with no political experience but a reputation as a MAGA acolyte and conspiratorial flame-thrower who had accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others of “treason” that should be punished by imprisonment or death.

Robert Draper

She told me that she now recognizes her own part in what she calls “this toxic culture” that has left her disgusted with politics. She once believed that Trump wanted to help ordinary people but has since been disillusioned by his actions and statements. “I was so naïve,” she said.

Flagged for Sexual Misconduct, Many Uber Drivers Stay on the Road

11 MIN READ

Emily Steel

Uber monitors passenger feedback for risky driver behavior. But I found that some drivers accused of serious sexual assault had records of prior complaints.

Emily Steel

After reviewing thousands of documents, I discovered that Uber’s systems recorded patterns that the company’s own data scientists had flagged as potential risks.

Emily Steel

One 2017 document revealed how Uber’s data scientists found that sexual assault was 12 times more likely if a driver had previous sexual misconduct complaints.

Emily Steel

My ongoing investigation into sexual violence during Uber rides has revealed a problem far bigger than publicly known. Executives prioritized expanding Uber’s business over strengthening protections.

Emily Steel

Uber says it is one of the safest ways to get around, with 99.9 percent of trips in the United States occurring without incident.
