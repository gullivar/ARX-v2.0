Mezmo’s context-first pipeline reduced prompt bloat and stabilized outputs, improving quality while cutting per-incident costs." — AI Engineer The Active Telemetry platform Who it's for SREs Predictable cost control Agentic routing optimizes data streams to eliminate unnecessary volume and cost. Mezmo for SREs Developers Faster time to diagnosis AI-powered SRE agent for root cause analysis cuts MTTR by 90%. Mezmo for Developers Agents Smarter, context-rich agents Give your AI precise telemetry data to support complex issues with accuracy. Mezmo for Agents The pillars  of Active Telemetry Active Context Enable operational AI in minutes with context engineered data sets. Give your agents simple prompts with context fueled accuracy reducing the window of failure to almost none. ‍ ‍ Active Engagement Give devs the flexible use of AI to access and act on any high-context telemetry, right within their workflows for a superior experience—without putting budget, performance, or control at risk. ‍ ‍ Active Analysis Process telemetry in-stream to accelerate Root Cause Analysis (RCA) with an agentic SRE. Extract key information and spot anomalies with full context – before data is ever stored. ‍ ‍ Active Routing Direct data with intent, reshape and normalize for agentic and human consumption, including "easy button" migration to Open Telemetry. Separate signal from noise by its value, triggering automated actions to dodge spikes or flag faults in real time. ‍ Explore more Blog Launching an agentic SRE for root cause analysis Read now Media Why Agentic SREs require Active Telemetry in Kubernetes Read now Blog The answer to SRE agent failures: Context Engineering Read now Analyst report Gartner® Market Guide for Telemetry Pipelines Read now Awards Ready to transform your observability?
