Podscribe uses a progressive, usage-based pricing model for measurement and verification, so you only pay for the impressions you use, with no minimum commitments. For example, the first 2 million podcast impressions in a month are billed at $1.50 CPM, the next 3 million at $1.35 CPM, and so on. Streaming, CTV, in-app, and display impressions have separate tiers. There’s also a $250 monthly platform fee to keep your account active. Because every advertiser’s goals differ, Podscribe typically provides a custom quote to match business size and media mix. Learn more about Podscribe’s pricing. Does Podscribe use AI in its podcast advertising measurement? Yes, AI and machine learning power Podscribe’s transcription, airchecks, and verification. Automated speech recognition converts podcast content into transcripts, then 18+ checks validate ad placement, duration, and talking points. This automation gives advertisers transparency without manual review, ensuring ads run as promised and measurement data is trustworthy. What are Podscribe’s podcast rankings, and how are they created? Podscribe publishes monthly rankings of top podcasts, publishers, and advertisers using real-time measurement data. These rankers track metrics like ad frequency, spend estimates, and audio reach etc., giving the industry a transparent view of who is buying and where. Rankings help advertisers benchmark performance, spot competitive trends, and discover new opportunities in podcasting. How does Podscribe help advertisers measure podcast ads? Podscribe tracks exposure to conversion at the household level, attributing website visits and purchases back to podcast ads even without a click. It then layers incrementality testing to prove which conversions were truly caused by the ad. Advertisers also benefit from verification reports that confirm ads ran as planned, giving a complete view of ROI. How is Podscribe different from other podcast attribution platforms like Podsights, Claritas and Magellan AI? Podsights and Chartable no longer exist in their original independent forms, as both were acquired and absorbed into larger companies. Podscribe, on the other hand, remains fully independent, ensuring unbiased attribution across publishers, networks, and audio formats. Compared to Claritas, Magellan AI, and other attribution tools, Podscribe combines deeper analytics with faster innovation, rolling out updates quickly in response to customer needs. We also offer incrementality testing to track true ad-driven conversions, along with automated aircheck verification to confirm ads run as intended. With real-time dashboards spanning podcasts, streaming audio, YouTube simulcasts, CTV, and broadcast radio, Podscribe delivers a comprehensive, cross-format view of performance that advertisers, agencies, and publishers can trust.
