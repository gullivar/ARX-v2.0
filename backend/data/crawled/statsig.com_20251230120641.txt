Testimonials
"Statsig's experimentation capabilities stand apart from other platforms we've evaluated. The ease of use, simplicity of integration help us efficiently get insight from every experiment we run. Statsig's infrastructure and experimentation workflows have also been crucial in helping us scale to hundreds of experiments across hundreds of millions of users."
Paul Ellwood
Head of Data Engineering
"We evaluated Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Eppo, but ultimately selected Statsig due to its comprehensive end-to-end integration. We wanted a complete solution rather than a partial one, including everything from the stats engine to data ingestion."
