Cement Brick Cost Model: Building Efficiency Block by Block Cement brick is a precision-engineered masonry unit, a revolutionary improvement over the usual clay brick. Made largely of Portland cement, water, and precisely graded aggregates, which can be sand, stone dust, or even recycled material, these bricks are produced with a high-pressure fusion and compaction process, not firing. This process, hydraulic pressing, produces a product with very high dimensional consistency and structural strength. Carpet Cost Model: Weaving Efficiency into Economics Carpet is a textile floor covering made of a pile, tufts of yarn or fiber, sewn to a backing for dimensional stability. Carpets are manufactured in various construction forms: tufted (universal across the world, yarn punched through a primary backing and treated with secondary backing), woven (Wilton and Axminster, highly valued for durability and pattern intricacy), needle-felt (bonded fibers for industrial applications), and knotted (hand-made rugs).
