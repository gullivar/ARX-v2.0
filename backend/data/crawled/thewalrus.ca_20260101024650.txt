The Conversation Piece Subscribe to this Podcast Canada is racing to build the infrastructure that will shape its economic and political future. But moving faster means little unless the systems guiding that development are strong enough to be trusted. Independent lawyer and consultant Jesse McCormick argues that making any meaningful progress with Canada’s major projects will require building trust with First Nations by prioritizing their consent and establishing regulatory systems that put First Nations behind the wheel. McCormick spoke at The Walrus Talks Sovereign Canada in Toronto on October 28, 2025.
