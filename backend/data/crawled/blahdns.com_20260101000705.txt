Announcements We will be migrating BuyPass GoSSL to Google CA due to deprecation of Buypass Class 2 CA 5 (Buypass GO SSL) on Sept 27, 2025. We will discontinue Japan, Switzerland, Finland by Jul 15, 2024 | Thanks again for all supporters and users 🥰 🙏 Servers TLS certificate validity check: Singapore | Germany DNS over HTTP/3 and QUIC protocol is now available.

BunnyCDN Diagnostic report Go What is DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) DNS over HTTPS (DoH) DNS over HTTPS is a new protocol designed to encrypt and secure DNS traffic over HTTPS. It prevents DNS hijacking and ISPs from sniffing your traffic. You can use will Infra on Android Phone, Mozilla firefox nightly, Chrome coming soon. DNSCrypt v2 client does support DoH, see dnscrypt configuration example on Windows, macOS, iOS (DNSCloak) What is DNS-over-TLS Encrypted DNS - DNS over TLS DNS over TLS support is available on all our services through port 853 (standard port, some service may support 443). DNS over TLS encrypts and authenticates all your DNS traffic to protect your privacy and prevent DNS hijacking and sniffing. Client software: Stubby | Unbound What is DNS The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6). FAQ Common question News Troubleshoot Block Method Donation Strict SPKI How to fix Chrome on Android phone leaking DNS, check HERE Supported TLS v1.3, 1.2 We drop ANY type. Why you building this porject? I started this project around 2016. During that time, with my private dns, I need an easy way to filter ads and tracker, so I rent a server and learn how to achive this. Why you dont like huge traffic? I'm still a student. and I run this service with my pocket money and spare time. Just as a hobby to learn somehting new. buying big server or Anti-DDOS service will cost lot.
