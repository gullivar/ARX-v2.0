Learn more What our Customers Say “D-ID exceeded all of my expectations with their generative AI solutions. Their technology transformed my project, Convo.ai, from a standard AI mobile solution to something that is truly unique & intuitive. Their commitment to excellence and cutting-edge technology make D-ID the go-to choice for anyone seeking superior generative AI services.” Andrew McCalla Founder & CEO, Convo AI “As a Conversational AI provider, by using D-ID technology we’re able to showcase our value proposition of having a live conversation with a generated photorealistic person in real-time using a neural voice across different channels (web and app). D-ID’s API is well documented and the D-ID technical team was very supportive during the implementation phase.” Fernando Moreira Senior Program Director, Defined AI “Marketing is a unique domain in that it must evolve at the same speed as consumers in order to maintain a strong connection with them. With the decrease in consumer attention spans, video has reigned king in the marketing world. Once GenAI was introduced into the mix, creating an AI avatar for Pitango was an intuitive next step to nurture our connection with our readers. Bringing our newsletter to life through an avatar allows us to cut through the noise of other traditional media that bombards our readers’ mailboxes, while also leaving an exciting impression on them. Finding the ultimate solution within our own portfolio was a true gift thanks to D-ID.” Sharon Erde Head of Marketing, Pitango MyHeritage is excited to partner with D-ID and integrate its technology into MyHeritage’s suite of advanced photo features. Historical photos provide us with a tangible link to our past. Seeing our ancestors’ faces come to life through video reenactment deepens our connection to our family history and is simply breathtaking Gilad Japhet Founder & CEO, at MyHeritage We were thrilled to be working with D-ID on this extraordinary campaign, and look forward to future collaborations. Simon Crowther Marketing Director, at Mondelēz Studio DI-D is a key partner for Grupo Fórmula and its subsidiary companies, TVOAI, Radio Formula. Thanks to its technology, we have developed high-impact content that has caused a huge stir in the media industry in Mexico and LATAM. I am certain that in the future we will continue to strengthen our collaboration given that artificial intelligence will be used more and more intensively in content creation. Oswaldo Alejandro Aguilar Castro TVOAI Programming Manager, Development of AI Projects and Systems Infrastructure, Radio Fórmula “In summary, D-ID has been the best solution we’ve found for achieving our mission. Their technology is not just innovative but also perfectly aligns with our focus on Social Emotional Learning (SEL), adding an emotionally resonant layer to the learning environment. We couldn’t have asked for a better partner in pioneering the future of English learning.” Michael Peled CEO, SingIt “We at SPIN, enjoy working with D-ID a lot. It has helped us to make our learning courses more accessible and engaging for our learners. Besides that, we can create these courses for a shorter period and without the need to travel.” Drin Ferataj Project Manager and Sport for Development Expert, SPIN Sport Innovation “Personalization is not just a trend; it’s the cornerstone of effective engagement. By addressing our recipients by name, we stood out in their crowded inboxes and deepened our connection with them. This campaign is a testament to how D-ID can transform email marketing into a highly personalized, engaging, and impactful tool.
