"I received an email from gambling.com to say I was one of the five winners of their free prize draw Christmas Cash Machine and had won £1000. I was thrilled, the communication from the team was excellent and the money was paid into my bank account within 2 days. Thank you to gambling.com for making it a very nice Christmas."
Sharon Paisley
"A clear guide that makes picking a new casino very easy. A really good casino guide with so many new casino offers on there. Will definitely be using again."
Shelly Wilson
"I won a hospitality LFC competition. Being a lifelong Liverpool fan this was the best prize I have ever won. I was nervous but Silvia was amazing, she is an absolute credit to the company. I enjoyed my prize on Wednesday against Newcastle and seen my beloved Liverpool win, just fantastic!"
Kyle S

Anjali Mittal
"All I can say is a huge thank you! I won a competition to watch the F1 in Las Vegas. Something that I could never believe would happen to me. The communication was 10/10, everything was all booked and information given with plenty of notice, the team were there to support me if needed on any questions."
