We're software producers of a different kind. Rather than market software the usual way, we openly deny its existence, and challenge our customers to do the same.

Skeptical? Just ask yourself these simple questions:

Have you ever seen a piece of software? Not just seen its output, or seen the pretty pictures it makes on the screen, but seen the software itself?
Have you ever felt a piece of software? Tasted, touched it? Heard it??
When you see programmers writing software, what does it look like they're really doing? Are the results of their work immediately apparent, as with carpenters, painters, and plumbers? Or do you get the impression they're just pressing buttons randomly because they hope a piece of cheese will appear in the wall dispenser the way it always used to back in the good old days?

We urge you to come to the obvious conclusion: there is no such thing as software. It is a mirage, an illusion, and the con artists who have foisted it on an unsuspecting public are some of the most successful swindlers in history.

By buying our products, you will receive nothing of value, but on the other hand we will not claim that you have received anything of value either. In this we differ from all other software companies, who will insist, in the face of abundant evidence to the contrary, that they have sold you a useable and beneficial item. We firmly believe that a marketing strategy based on brutal honesty will be more effective in the long run than one based on deception and mass hypnotism.

Who are we?

We suspect many more people may be involved in this than we know of; for one thing, somebody must be responsible for all the mailing lists and stuff available from this server, and it certainly isn't us.
