As someone just starting out, I needed a shipping partner I could trust—and Shiprocket made things super easy. Their quick and smooth deliveries meant my customers got their orders on time, and that’s helped me keep them happy and coming back for more. Riya Pant - Founder Blur India Being from a tier-2 city like Kanpur, it was really tough for us to deliver orders on time across India. But with Shiprocket’s help, we were able to store our products in multiple warehouses across the country. This made our delivery much faster and smoother. Santosh Kakkirala - Manager, Operations Phool I’ve been using ShiprocketX to ship my orders to the USA and UK, and it’s been a smooth experience. The platform is super easy to use—I can create shipping labels, track packages and handle orders without any hassle. Plus, it connects well with major eCommerce platforms, which really saves me time. Abhay - Founder The Platnum We used to sell this oil by travelling from village to village—setting up stalls in the lanes, in front of temples, and during local fairs and festivals. Some people told us about Shiprocket.

                                They explained that Shiprocket is a platform that helps you manage orders from home. “Just make the oil,” they said, “we’ll help you with shipping, and your payments will go directly to your account.” At first, I couldn’t understand how all of this would work.

                                My friend Vivek taught me how to manage everything through Shiprocket. Since we started using it, we’ve never faced a loss—not even from COD orders or returns. Prithvi Raj Adivasi Community After COVID, everything changed—and Shiprocket made growth easier. I could store products in their fulfilment centres and manage everything remotely.

                                Before Shiprocket, courier rates were confusing and many areas weren’t even serviceable. But Shiprocket simplified it all—clear pricing with GST, 15–20 courier partners in one dashboard, and smooth tech that just works.
