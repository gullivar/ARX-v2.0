Accelerate your entire workflow

From your first line of code to final deployment, GitHub provides AI and automation tools to help you build and ship better software faster.

A Copilot chat window with the 'Ask' mode enabled. The user switches from 'Ask' mode to 'Agent' mode from a dropdown menu, then sends the prompt 'Update the website to allow searching for running races by name.' Copilot analyzes the codebase, then explains the required edits for three files before generating them. Copilot then confirms completion and summarizes the implemented changes for the new functionality allowing users to search races by name and view paginated, filtered results.
Your AI partner everywhere. Copilot is ready to work with you at each step of the software development lifecycle.
