Why is the very little great music made these days?

IMHO, it's cos everyone is so focused on being an@l ("correct")

From the top to the bottom, formula 'works' (in an economic sense) for the masses. So why risk anything different?

To solve the problem, we need to ban click and track at live events, make @Cid free, and embrace and celebrate difference and uniqueness.

Peace.

Darkglass anagram
C
By Cory rich40

Effects [BG]
8 Replies
I’m strongly considering buying the anagram. How easy is it to learn how to use? How easy is it to do the firmware updates with a laptop? How practical is it to use while gigging? It would be ran through my Mesa Subway WD800 amp. I had the Fender rumble stage 800 years ago and never set it up to use with the footswitch that came with it, so it was only used in the default setting never utilizing the effects. I’m sure I could have figured it out. Is the anagram more user friendly than the Fender rumble 800 stage as far as being able to use the effects as needed?

Pedalboards - Pedaltrain vs Mono vs Amazon cheapo
By smeet
Today at 2:07 PM
Effects [BG]
15 Replies
I'm looking to build a new pedalboard, and for the first time I'm looking outside of the Pedaltrain universe.

I need something solid, light, and the ideal dimensions are about 18" x 12.5". I also need a good amount of clearance under the board, and the ability to attach power (Cioks DC7), I/O ports, and maybe even a pedal or two on the underside of the board. I also want a light, protective carrying case with storage for cables etc.

The size I want seems to match the Pedaltrain Classic Jr as well as a Mono small. Mono has 2 designs: rail and the one with holes, I don't understand the functional differences.

Both weigh about the same. The Mono design is slicker looking. I *think* both have the same amount of clearance underneath. I don't know if they are equally easy to mount things on. Mono is more expensive. The Mono Club case is much better than the crappy Pedaltrain ones.

And then there are super cheap aluminum boards from various semi-generic makers on Amazon, and of course other makers like Rockboard etc.

I don't want to spend a ton for a brand name, but I want a well thought out solution that is easy to work with.

My current thinking (to stay with what I know will work) is to get the Pedaltrain Classic Jr and Mono Club case.

Any advice for me?

“NBD” another Sugi has entered the states!
By Jason Bonilla
Today at 1:16 PM
Basses [BG]
5 Replies
Not really NBD as I’ve had it about a week now, Geek-In-Box had a store wide sale on reverb I thought was a good opportunity to score a new Sugi for lower than some are going used. GIB was great to work with, FedEx was pretty slow in the customs side of things. I have been admiring Sugi basses from afar a couple years now. They don’t pop up used too much here in the states and many of the used ones overseas ask close to the price of new.

I kind of was content just admiring them as they’re usually configured in a passive JJ format. There’s an Active one for sale in the states that’s been on Reverb for like 3 years, but I’m not sure if the guy selling that is even alive as he’s gotten like 30 offers on that bass and has nothing else on sale. While my Ideal set up on one of these would be dual coils and something like a Nordstrand pre, when I saw this humbucker NB5 I was in awe! While Sugi definitely falls into the “essentially a jazz bass, just doesn’t look like a jazz bass” category normally. This Humbucker NB5 does a number of things I prefer over something like say a standard non deluxe BN5. 24 frets, smaller body, and individually splittable Humbuckers.
While my ideal set up would be all of this with a Nordstrand preamp, I don’t have the heart to mod something so intentionally put together, and it sound great passive anyway!

Geek-In-Box Yokohama spec’d out this bass from Sugi, and they have great taste! Beautiful burl maple top over a nice reasonably light korina body that just slightly peeks through the translucent black finish. 3 piece maple neck with [not entirely sure what] stringers and Indian rosewood board. Gold gotoh hardware all around. I love that GIB spec’d this out as vol, blend, tone as I personally prefer that to Vol Vol.

Sound wise the pickups in and out of Humbucker mode have this nice airy growlyness with a notable low mid accentuation. Whether you attribute that to the korina body or just the way the pickups are wound, it’s there. I kind of felt the mids were too airy at first and was trying to see how to dial them out, but these pickups are actually pretty responsive to subtle changes in volume and dialing down the volume knob just a touch actually closes up and rounds out those nicely to a more modern jazz type of tone, so it’s like having a nice old school jazz tone and modern with just a volume adjustment (probably nothing new to a lot of you guys but I’ve usually run volume wide open. In both Humbucker mode the bass almost has a thunder bird like character which I adore. I’ve been playing the bass at church and at home, just figuring out how what tones are in store, it’s got a tone of different vibes in it for a passive bass, and makes a great companion to my Spector’s very active sound.

Tomorrow my neck turns fifty years old. I bought it in 1976 from E.U.Wurlitzers in Boston. It has been on several basses, starting with a 73 Jazz and ending up on a 98MIM Pbass. I had the fingerboard dressed a few years ago. It shows some wear, but has been trouble free. Still shows some nice birdseye on it’s back.

Did Fender make maple board w white block inlay necks in 73? No serial on the headstock and the seller of this neck doesn’t want to remove it from the body, and the body isn’t the original 73 J so no 73 serial on the neckplate.

Today I am fortunate to be able to afford a brand new finely crafted Rickenbacker 4003SW.

Nearly 50 years ago, my mother used her hard-earned money to buy me a new Rickenbacker 4001 bass in 1978.

Unfortunately, I ran into financial hardship and had sold that beloved bass in 1998.

I am truly grateful for coming full circle as there are so many youthful memories attached to playing a Rickenbacker bass.

Greetings and happy new year!!

I unexpectedly purchased this DB over the Christmas holiday. I think (Hope) I got a good deal.

I have been playing BG for many years. I also have an NS CR-4 EUB which I enjoy playing.

Now that I have the DB, what information and advice can I get about this bass.
What can you tell me about the maker, about the strings, about the pick up, and about the bridge.

I’m looking to start a journey. I love the acoustic resonance and the thumpyness. I will be seeking a DB teacher to help my playing.

Any help and information you all can provide will be gratefully appreciated.

Good source for gold anodized aluminum pickguards....

Hardware, Setup & Repair [BG]

I know there are a few sources that come recommended for gold anodized aluminum pickguards, but I had such a good experience getting one for my AM Pro II Precision five-string. This was most definitely a custom-order project, but I'm so pleased with the results.....


HERAD
HERAD
 herad.co

Justin Hermes was awesome to work with. Very quick with responses to emails. Since this was a custom cut pick guard project, Justin went way above and beyond to make sure that the pick guard pattern was perfect. After a couple of tries with pics and traces by me that Justin was skeptical of, I called Fender and they immediately emailed me the PDF design drawing of the pick guard for the AM Pro II P5, which I was able to forward on to Justin. And the pick guard he made fit absolutely perfectly! No trimming or adjustments to make the pick guard fit at all.

And at the time, the total cost, including shipping from Australia to me, was $107.00. Seriously! That could have certainly changed by now.

It took a couple of months for the the pickguard to be made and shipped to me. But the results were very well worth the effort, I think.

I have a new (used) Sandberg active bass with stiff blend and bass knobs. The other knobs rotate freely. I’ve used deoxit in the past but with some hesitation since some say it can degrade pots over time. Are there any other solutions to try? The pots are solid shaft and the screws are secure but not overly tight.

Bass Player Confessions

Let's end the year in a fun way. Let's take advantage of the relative anonymity that the internet gives us to confess weird things we do, or things we never knew how to do or understood, and that our bandmates or musician friends don't know about.

1). I can't figure out how to use the GK RB800; it just doesn't work for me. There's one in the rehearsal room, but it sounds different every time I go there. I don't even know which knob to turn anymore.





2) Every time I practice with my unplugged bass, I make sure the volume and tone are at maximum, as if that would help... 

3) I used to take naps holding my bass next to me, it felt good.

Does this kind of plagal cadence have a name?
By mambo4
Yesterday at 2:56 PM
General Instruction [BG]
16 Replies
TLDR: Is there a name for IV-I when the IV chord has the root of the V in the bass?
example:
C | E7 | F - F/G | C

My latest theory lightbulb moment has arisen from learning to Tom Waits chord progressions,
and he does this sort of thing all the time.
It's got an old school soul/blues/ gospel kinda feel to it.
Often these find them transcribed (in online amateur efforts) as some kind of V(7 sus 4 ) or V(11) chord
But in my published material it's usually explicitly a slash chord like F/G
I've seen it called the "soul dominant"

There's a lot of ways to parse the voicing
Could be IV (add9) with 9 in the root
But if I try to hammer it into a V chord I see a V7 ( sus 4, sus 2 ) or V11 ( no 3rd, no 5th )
So sonically it sort of resolves like both a IV-I and a V-I at once.


I struggled with it at first but once I understood the pattern I realized I hear it all over many kinds of music.
I love stumbling across these things.
Is there any kind of academic name for it?

for reference, the end of verse turnarounds in this one:

NAD: Musicmaster Bass Amp

Just picked this up today off FB Marketplace for $550. Not a steal, but a decent price IMO.

I did have to replace the preamp tube, as it was rattling pretty bad. Luckily, I had plenty of 12ax7 on hand, so no sweat.

It sounds great with my guitars, and is loud af to my ears. Much above 2 I need to pop in my earplugs. With bass I can turn it up a little louder, but still not much.

There is something of a hum to it no matter what, so I’m thinking it might need a good servicing/recapping.

Anyway, here’s pics!

Does anyone know what G&L used for finish material in the mid to late 80s? I am having one shipped to me (PA to ME) and ever since a Nash with nitro checked on me winter shipping has made me a little nervous. The Nash was relic’d already so I don’t sweat it too much but the L1K is super clean for its age….I’ll only be the second owner. FWIW, I’m always extra cautious about acclimating before opening despite new instrument excitement. Thanks in advance for your input!

Collaborating with well-known pros
By Standalone
Yesterday at 11:28 AM
Band Management [BG]
25 Replies
Except on stage, I’m a rather shy and often awkward person. In recent years a friendship and working relationship has developed between my bandleader and a regional/national level bandleader and guitarist that my guitarist has always looked up to and drawn inspiration from.

It’s a real mentorship type of relationship, and he’s sat in with us and asked to produce our most recent album, and even laid down some rhythm and lead tracks on it. It’s a very relaxed and positive vibe, and our scene is very much about humility and no egos.

But still, I find myself being super reserved and, I guess, afraid to fanboy too much. I always have this sense that well known artists probably get annoyed with fans and random folks. I am pretty reserved in the same way in most collaboration situations with folks “in the big print” sections of the festival poster.

I guess it doesn’t really hurt to be on the quiet side, but I was curious out TB’ers experiences and takes on this

I recently had a situation where I accidentally left a music store with a brand new ( 2021 old stock) Momose 5 string J with a Buckeye Burl top. After buying my first Japanese bass over ten years ago- an early 2000 Bacchus 5 Ebony board 24 fret Sadowsky Modern styled burst with Warwick style bridge- I have somehow ended up with 5 Japanese basses to accompany my 2000 Fender P Hot Rod Ash-Maple 4. The others include a Fernandes Moon copy that is so nice to play, a mid-eighties Tune Bass Maniac fretless 4, and a Greco Lucite Dan Armstrong copy that is perfect ( it was sitting in a case for 25 years).
Here is the webpage from the dealer that features my exact bass. MJ24-MV BEB5-SP21/E

I’ve found lots of threads about cases and storing basses but can’t find the information I’m looking for…

I’d like to store my upright in its case but also on a stand? Does anyone else do this or know of a capable stand?

Storing it outside of its case is a no go for me and leaning the bass in a corner is doable but is going to require a lot of rearranging.

I don't know if I love or hate 60s specs on a P bass - anyone else feel this at one point?
By Thom Fioriglio
Yesterday at 6:01 PM
Basses [BG]
56 Replies
Hi all, I have a Fender Vintera II Road Worn 60s Precision Bass that I've owned for little over a month. And I am not sure if I love it or hate it. I bought it to have a P bass with flatwounds and thought it would be a good compliment to my modern Fender American Professional II P Bass with rounds. And it is. When I first got it, I loved everything about it. The Charcoal Frost color is stunning, and a color I've always loved since I've seen the Sean Hurley Custom Shop bass. The Nitro aging is done so well. It's light!!! Weighing 8.3 pounds!! And the tone!! Oh man, with Labella 760FL flatwound strings, just sounds so good! And it's got that 60s vibe with the tug bar, reverse tuners, Fender 60s logo and look that is just so classic.

So what then is the problem? The 60s specs. The more I play it, the more I don't like the neck. Well, not that I don't like it, but compared to my Am Pro II neck, it's just not very comfortable and more difficult to play. The 1.75" nut and the 7.25" radius is just not as comfortable to me as a modern Fender neck. It helps that the neck is thin, and definitely playable, compared to other baseball bat sized necks I've played. But the width, plus the rounder radius, I seem to be struggling with to play.

Has anyone else been through this? Bought a played a 60s spec bass and loved it for a while, and then began to rethink it and go back to a bass with a thinner, more comfortable neck? I've tried Jazz basses, and those are too thin. For me, the 1 ⅝" nut and 9.5" radius just seems so right. I did consider selling it and getting another Am Pro II and string it with flats. But there is something about the 60s look and vibe that is just so classic and cool.

Thanks for sharing your experiences.
