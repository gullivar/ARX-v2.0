Heroes we are going to highlight today are the statistical outliers that consistently outperform the competition. For supports, we are seeing a resurgence of strong healers and save heroes. For cores, however… let’s just say we are sorry for bringing this to everyone’s attention, but stats don’t lie. Broken Things in Dota (For Now) By KawaiiSocks • 8 days ago • 9 Broken is an interesting word in the context of Dota, as it can describe something very powerful and something close to useless. It is the reason we chose this word specifically for this blog post, as the new patch introduced quite a lot of very broken things into the game. Today we are going to look at these outliers: things that are not in any way balanced and that will hopefully be the first to get some changes in the next patch. Figuring Out Largo By KawaiiSocks • 15 days ago • 8 The wait is over and Largo, the Bard-Frog, is finally in the game. The hero’s design and vibes are definitely a highlight, but we are not here to talk about how ridiculously cute his little froglings are or how fun it is to play a rhythm-based mini-game in Dota. We are here to figure out what the hero is and how to use him effectively. Underrated Teams of DreamLeague Season 27 By KawaiiSocks • 22 days ago • 4 The last big Dota tournament before the calendar year is over. DreamLeague Season 27 is trying to finish the year off with a bang: twenty four participating teams, an extended Swiss Group Stage and a proper, double-elimination playoff. This is definitely a tournament to watch, especially considering some squads might surprise you. Ignored Heroes of the New Season: Cores By KawaiiSocks • 29 days ago • 3 Last week we talked about heroes, completely ignored by the professional players since the start of the new competitive season. Since then another hero joined the “professionally viable” pantheon and there are currently nine heroes in total, going completely uncontested throughout the first four tournaments. We’ve already discussed the support part of this infamous roster last week, so today we are going to concentrate on cores and why they might be so unpopular among pros, while being viable and even strong in your everyday pubs. Ignored Heroes of the New Season: Supports By KawaiiSocks • about 1 month ago • 6 There have been three big tournaments since the start of the new competitive season and despite the lack of gameplay updates, there are occasional new meta trends. After looking through the data from the tournaments, we’ve found that only ten heroes remained uncontested. Today we are going to look at the support portion of this list and discuss why they might be so unpopular with pros, whether they are still a decent pick in pubs and what buffs we could potentially expect. Cosmetic Updates are not Just Cosmetic By KawaiiSocks • about 1 month ago • 7 The initial reaction to the Monster Hunter collaboration was mixed. It was something unexpected, something quite niche and for the majority of players it didn’t really matter. Or so some of us thought. Well, perhaps we were wrong. How Stats Can Help You Win Games By KawaiiSocks • about 2 months ago • 7 We are a statistics website and a lot of our work is aimed at helping people get better at the game. Using tools for analysis isn’t going to magically improve your mechanical skill, but it can provide a lot of insight into how and where one can improve. Today we are going to look over some of the tools that I personally find the most helpful when figuring out what and how to play. Dota for Action Players By KawaiiSocks • about 2 months ago • 1 Over the last several posts I’ve talked at length about the theoretical and strategic parts of Dota. In my opinion good strategy is equally, if not more important than the mechanical skill. Moreover, it is easier to develop strategic skills from a written blog post. However, it doesn’t mean the mechanical aspect can be neglected and today I am going to go through some thoughts on how your action game or shooter experience can be adapted to Dota. Structuring Your Teamfight By KawaiiSocks • 2 months ago • 4 Over the last month we’ve talked about the general theory of Dota and what common mistakes a lot of beginner players make when it comes to itemisation. Today we would like to shift from theory to practice, at least as much as it is possible in a written blog post. FISSURE Playground 2 Preview By KawaiiSocks • 2 months ago • 1 The first big tournament after the International is starting very soon. The tumultuous post-TI roster reshuffle should be slowly coming to an end, as teams start finalising their initial strategies for the season, and Playground 2 will give us a pretty good idea of what to expect from the household names. For now, though, this is purely speculation on what to expect post-reshuffle. The Dangers of Theoretical Knowledge By KawaiiSocks • 3 months ago • 10 Last week we discussed some of the most persistent beginner itemisation mistakes. At the end of the post, there was also an idea that kept on bugging me for the whole week. Most “bad” item choices in Dota happen not because the player is doing something stupid, but because they are doing something theoretically smart. Making Correct Item Choices By KawaiiSocks • 3 months ago • 13 One of the most beautiful aspects of Dota is its itemisation. Knowing what to build and when is extremely important and one bad item choice can flip an easy game into an unwinnable one. Today we are going to discuss what items fulfill what role and when to build them, concentrating primarily on items that are mistakenly built too often. Common Beginner Mistakes By KawaiiSocks • 3 months ago • 7 Dota’s been steadily growing for the past several months and that means new and returning players are coming into the game. This is incredibly exciting and we are in a unique position to make learning Dota just a little bit easier. So the next couple of weeks are going to be dedicated to smoothing out the learning process. Today we are going to start with the most common mistakes we see beginner players make in their games. The International 2026 Wishlist By KawaiiSocks • 3 months ago • 9 It is an yearly tradition to discuss what we would like to see improved by the next International. We usually had a lot of constructive feedback in regard to the biggest Dota tournament of the year, but Valve decided to make writing this blog post really hard, by making one of the best TIs so far. So this is going to be very nitpicky. Did you know you can sign in securely with Steam to access your personal Dota 2 profile?
