A year ago, we launched Luminar Mobile to bring the power of AI-driven photo editing to iPad and iPhone, making professional-quality edits accessible on the go. learn more visit newsroom quotes What the media is saying about us “Outstanding features like Panorama Stitching, Magic Light, Focus Stacking, and Background Removal turn your outdoor landscape shots into awe-inspiring pieces of art. Accent AI, for example, can intelligently balance hue, saturation, highlights, contrast, and details with one simple slider. Portrait Bokeh makes your subject absolutely pop by softening up the background, modifying depth correction, and subtly retouching skin tones.” “Luminar Neo has unique AI photo editing tools that remove power lines from street scenes and dust from digital photos, as well as a vast selection of effects and adjustments, all in a clear and pleasing interface.” “The photo editing software known as Luminar Neo is another programme that I have found to be quite useful. This widely used application provides a variety of functions that are enabled by artificial intelligence, such as Sky Replacement, Structure enhancement, and Accent modification. Because it offers sophisticated editing features that are tailored to my requirements as a photographer, it has become my platform of choice for taking my photographs to the next level.” “Skylum’s Luminar Neo isn’t as well known as some of its photo-editing rivals, but it has a neatly designed interface that makes it easy to explore its many editing tools and experiment with different effects.” “Luminar Neo has always been one step ahead of the photo editing game with its AI features.” “Luminar Neo is ideal for photographers and content creators who want to make regular photos spectacular with minimal know-how and effort. It’s probably less useful to more technically minded photographers, and Skylum’s constantly changing deals and offers can be confusing.” “Luminar Neo can help you to capture the vision you have for your photos, whether that involves subtle tweaking or much more comprehensive reimaginings of the original shot. And the program continues to be developed at breakneck speed, with no less than six new program updates and dozens of new or improved features just over the last 3-4 months.” feedback Trusted by our users Trustpilot Skylum Products Luminar Neo Overview Pricing Features Pro Tools Use Cases Alternatives Trial Discounts Luminar Neo User Guide Luminar Neo Beta Luminar Mobile Overview Luminar for iPad Luminar for iPhone Luminar for Vision Pro Luminar Mobile User Guide Aperty Overview Pricing Aperty User Guide Online Tools Online Editor Color Palette Color Picker Marketplace Presets Luminar Neo Presets Lightroom Presets Bundles Luminar Neo Bundles LUTs Luminar Neo LUTs Aperty LUTs Overlays Textures Sky Objects Backgrounds Extra Other software X Membership Skies E-boooks Courses Company About Skylum Careers Ambassadors Affiliate Program Terms of use Privacy Policy AI Guidelines Contact Us Help Contact Support FAQs User Guide Change Choice on Cookies For Business Skylum for Business Volume Licensing Reseller Program Learn More Blog How To Newsroom Our community Luminar for Creators Earn with Luminar Marketplace Top On Blog Manual Mode in Photography Best Free Photo Editing Software for Mac Best Free Photoshop Alternatives Fix Blurry Pictures On iPhone How Big Is 8x10 Photo Size Stuck Pixel vs Dead Pixel Free Photoshop Plugins for Photographers Landscape vs Portrait orientation Top How To Tips How To Get Digital Camera Photos On Phone How to Invert a Picture on iPhone How To Change Background Color On Instagram Story How to Convert HEIC to JPG on iPhone How To Make A Photo Look Like A Polaroid How to Combine Photos on iPhone How To Format SD Card On Macbook How To Be Photogenic How To Remove Motion Photo How to Reduce the Size of a Picture Join our newsletter Please, enter valid email!
