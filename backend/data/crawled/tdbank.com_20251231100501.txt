Important Disclosures TD Small Business Checking Offer: + Cash back offer valid May 1, 2025 and July 31, 2025 and is available when opening a qualified TD Business Checking account at a TD Store or online and meeting the criteria below. You will not qualify for the cash back offer if you are an existing TD Bank Business Checking customer OR had a previous Business Checking account that was closed within the preceding 12 months OR have received a prior Business Checking account bonus at any time. Eligibility is determined based on the SSN/TIN of the business used to open the account. If a Sole Proprietor using an SSN also has a Personal account, the Business account would still be eligible for the promotion. To qualify for the $500 Cash Back Offer, you must open a new TD Business Checking account. Business Simple Checking, Business Convenience Checking Plus, Business Interest Checking Plus or Business Premier Checking products are eligible. The criteria below must also be met: 1. Deposit a minimum of $2,500 within the first 25 days and maintain at least a $2,500 balance for 90 additional days from the 25th day after account opening. 2. Conduct 25 qualifying transactions across the first 3 statement cycles. Your eligible transactions include ACH debits/credits, bill pay, Merchant Solutions settlement transactions, incoming/outgoing wires, checks paid, Small Business Zelle transactions, Visa Business Debit card transactions, digital express remote deposits, and settlement transactions for TD Online Accounting or Tap-to-Pay on iPhone payments received. After you have completed the requirements outlined above, we’ll deposit the bonus in your new account on or before 180 days after account opening. To receive the bonus, your account must not be closed or restricted at the time of payout. If your new checking account is closed by you or TD Bank within 6 months after account opening, TD Bank reserves the right to deduct the bonus amount at closing. TD Bank’s standard account opening requirements and conditions apply. Bonus will be subject to backup withholding to the extent applicable to you under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code if you meet certain other conditions. We may issue you an IRS Form 1099-MISC or other appropriate forms reporting the value of the bonus. Offer may be withdrawn at any time. TD Bank Employees and Canadian Cross-border banking Customers are not eligible. * Important Details about TD Debit Card Advance SM By enrolling in TD Debit Card Advance SM , you are permitting us to authorize and pay ATM and one-time debit card transactions when you do not have enough money available in your account to cover the transaction. A $35 fee applies to each transaction that overdraws your available account balance by more than $50, whether that transaction is made by debit card, check, in-person withdrawal, or other electronic means (up to a maximum of 3 fees per day per account). You are obligated to pay overdrafts immediately. Whether an overdraft will be paid is our discretion, and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing, you are not making regular deposits, or you repeatedly overdraft. TD Debit Card Advance SM is different from other forms of overdraft coverage in that it does not transfer funds from an approved line of credit, savings account, or home equity line of credit. The order in which transactions are processed may affect the total amount of overdraft fees incurred. For more information see the Personal Deposit Account Agreement . 1 Overdraft Services do not apply to TD Essential Banking Accounts. We may decline or return transactions that would result in an overdraft. Transactions that you make may cause your Account to overdraw but we will not assess your TD Essential Banking Account an overdraft fee or return item fee. For example, preauthorized transactions and other transactions may post to your Account even when the available balance in your Account is not sufficient to pay the transaction. 2 When items are presented for payment that result in your available Account balance being overdrawn by more than $50, Overdraft Grace provides you with an opportunity to receive refunds for overdraft fees if your available Account balance is at least $0, inclusive of any pending or posted items, at the end of the next business day. 3 Our Standard Overdraft Service may allow ACH payments, recurring debit transactions and personal checks to go through for a fee. A $35 fee applies to each transaction that overdraws your available account balance by more than $50, (up to a maximum of 3 fees per day per account). Whether an overdraft will be paid is our discretion, and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing, you are not making regular deposits, or you repeatedly overdraft. You are obligated to pay overdrafts immediately. Have a question? Find answers here What's your question? Ask Us Popular Questions Sorry, we didn't find any results.
