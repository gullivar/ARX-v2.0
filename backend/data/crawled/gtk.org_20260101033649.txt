GIMP Fonts Calculator Web Inkscape Evolution Image Viewer Polari Podcasts Maps Transmission Secrets HandBrake A feature-rich development tool GTK has all the features that a widget toolkit needs to have. These features make it the most trusted toolkit for developing Linux applications. Portability Projects built using GTK and its dependencies run on well known operating systems. Stability GTK delivers the enticing features and superb performance which adds to your applications. Language Bindings GTK is written in C but has been designed to support a wide range of languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, Rust and many more . Interfaces GTK has a comprehensive collection of core widgets like Buttons, Windows, Toolbars for use in your application. Open Source GTK is a free and open-source project maintained by GNOME and an active community of contributors. GTK is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License . API GTK boasts of an easy to use API which helps in decreasing your development time and help you achieve better results. Accommodation GTK caters to many features like Native look and feel, theme support, Object-oriented approach that today’s developers look for in a toolkit. Foundations GTK is built on top of GLib. GLib provides the fundamental data types and system integration points to avoid duplicated code in applications. Develop with GTK By taking advantage of GTK being a cross-platform development tool and its easy to use API, you can develop amazing apps using the GTK. If you are interested in developing an app, get started now by developing this example application . Develop GTK GTK is a large project and relies on volunteers from around the world. To help us with the project development, hack away on the existing bugs and feature requests . Looking for Help? If you want to ask questions about GTK, whether it’s for developing applications with GTK or contributing to GTK itself, you can use the GNOME Discourse instance, under the Platform/Core category. You can use tags like gtk or glib to narrow down the topic of discussion to specific libraries. You can also ask questions in our Matrix room.
