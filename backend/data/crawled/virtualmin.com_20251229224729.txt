Virtualmin is a powerful and flexible web hosting control panel for Linux, built for web developers, IT professionals, agencies, and hosting providers. It can run on almost any Linux distribution, with a hassle-free automated installer available for Debian and Ubuntu, AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It is available as a community-supported open-source GPL edition and a feature-packed Pro version. It brings together DNS, SSL, web, mail, and backups in one place, with local and cloud DNS, automatic SSL, Apache or Nginx with multiple PHP versions, a full mail stack with spam and virus protection, and scheduled backups to popular cloud storage services. WP Workbench adds one central place to manage WordPress core, plugins, themes, backups, cloning, and quick admin access, while the built-in CLI and remote HTTP API make it easy to automate server setup, everyday tasks, and bulk changes across all your sites and services.

Virtualmin Features

Virtualmin gives you one place to manage websites, mail, databases, DNS, backups, and WordPress on your Linux servers. Built on Webmin, it adds hosting-focused tools for everyday operations, including automation, reseller and user management, and integration with popular cloud services.

The strength of Virtualmin is how it works with your OS, using the standard packages your Linux system already provides instead of building its own stack. This keeps servers lean and predictable and makes it easy to move from panels like Plesk, cPanel, or DirectAdmin without disrupting your data or backups.

Why Virtualmin?

Virtualmin has plenty of competition, both open source and commercial, but it sets out to be the most powerful and flexible web hosting control panel you can run on Linux while staying lean and fast. You get the freedom of real Linux with a clean web interface that makes everyday work quick and effortless.

Flexibility where you need it

Virtualmin is unlike anything else, when it comes to flexibility and power. Designed by system administrators for system administrators, it works with you to configure services and accounts in the way you choose.

Ease of use where you want it

Virtualmin isn’t just for hard core system administrators. It scales back the complexity of the user interface based on the privileges of the logged in user, and allows delegation of tasks, based on skill and level of trust.

Maximize efficiency

Virtualmin has always been focused on automating away repetitive tasks without impeding your ability to customize. Simplifying complex tasks is a Virtualmin specialty.

Extensible, scriptable, customizable

Virtualmin was made to be extended, scripted, and customized. With a modular architecture, you can write new modules and themes, drive it from scripts or other programs, and create server templates to suit your needs.

Command line friendly

With Virtualmin, working from the user interface is not the only way to do it. With complete command line access to nearly all user interface functions, and the ability to configure most services using standard text editors and tools, Virtualmin works your way.

Professional support

Virtualmin support is provided by the people who build and maintain the software. When you file a support ticket with us, you’ll receive prompt, expert, advice. Tickets are usually answered within 24 hours, and every member of our staff has years of experience.
