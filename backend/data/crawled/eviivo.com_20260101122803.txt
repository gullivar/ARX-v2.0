It makes the hotel run itself with regards to admin, payments, bookings, guest communications; I don’t need to worry about any of this at all, it just does it all for me. It’s an absolute life saver. Argyll and Bute Lynne , Multi-B&B Owner We grew 30% above our previous best year, and I was able to watch that month-on-month. That gave me such a drive and enthusiasm throughout the year. County Down Tony , Inn Regional Manager What we love about eviivo is the simplicity; having access to the figures at the touch of a button. Summer’s pretty much boxed off, and we’ve got excellent occupancy with you guys. Conwy Vanessa , B&B Owner The eviivo app is a godsend.
