A NOTE ON COMMUNITY AND BELONGING
“True community is based upon equality, mutuality, and reciprocity. It affirms the richness of individual diversity as well as the common human ties that bind us together.”
—Pauli Murray
From the books and the authors we publish and the equity-minded pedagogy initiative we are launching to the community-building activities, keynotes, and events we offer in-house, we strive to build a culture of belonging and to champion diverse voices, experiences, and ideas.

He was 82. The former vice-chairman and editor-in-chief of the trade department, Lawrence remained editor-at-large until his death, most recently working on books by David Ignatius, Michael Lewis, and David McCloskey.
