My husband and I have been members of LifeLock for over 5 years. We appreciate knowing that LifeLock securely monitors our personal information and accounts. It is a relief to know that we will be alerted to any activity in our accounts and properties. The peace of mind that comes with having LifeLock is well worth any cost.

As a senior adult, finances and life can be overwhelming at times.   It is great to feel safe and protected by LifeLock. There are so many scams and thieves preying on older adults; it is such a comfort to know that LifeLock is watching out for me. Thanks LifeLock!

Awesome
