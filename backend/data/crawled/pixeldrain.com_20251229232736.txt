Subscription plans

Pixeldrain features two different payment modes. We offer a monthly subscription which is managed by Patreon, and a Prepaid subscription which supports a dozen different payment providers. With Prepaid you pay in advance to charge your credit, then usage will be subtracted from your account credit. For low usage Prepaid is usually better as the monthly fee is much lower.
