WHO WE ARE

InnoGames was founded in Stade, a mid-sized town near Hamburg, in 2007, when brothers Hendrik and Eike Klindworth and their friend Michael Zillmer decided to pursue their dream of creating innovative and engaging games. To do so, they took the bold step of dropping out of their studies. Today, the company they have built is one of Germany’s leading developers of mobile and browser games.

The purpose of InnoGames is clear: We are here to make great games for our players – with high quality virtual worlds that link millions of people around the world. Anywhere, anytime.

Do you want to build an empire that lasts through the ages, save your village and explore a spectacular world full of mysteries, or use the magnificent powers of the gods of ancient Greece to vanquish your foes? Then we have the right games for you! Enjoy thousands of hours of fun gameplay, high-end graphics, and seamless cross-platform play without having to pay for any of it. All our games are free to play without restrictions or time limits.

You like our games and want to play a role in their development? Check out our vacancies now.
