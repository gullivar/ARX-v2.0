A Ticking Legacy



This 1890 Patek Philippe pocket watch was a treasured heirloom of the family of Justice John Marshall Harlan, who served on the Court from 1877–1911. The gold timepiece was gifted to Justice Harlan in 1895 and was later inherited by his grandson, Justice John M. Harlan, who served on the Court from 1955–1971, and reportedly wore the watch regularly. He added a few personal touches, including a monogrammed Italian pocket knife and his honorary 1957 Order of the Coif fob from the George Washington Chapter. The pocket watch remained with the Harlan family until it was acquired by the Supreme Court in 1999 with the assistance of the former law clerks of the second Justice Harlan and the Supreme Court Historical Society.
