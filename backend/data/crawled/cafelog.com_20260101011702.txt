A classy news/weblog tool (aka logware). How does it work ? You type something and hit "blog this" and in the next second it's on your page(s). You can write extended entries, or even entries that span multiple pages. You can also use BloggerAPI clients to post to your b2 weblog. What's original in b2 ? Pages are generated dynamically from the MySQL database, so no clumsy 'rebuilding' is involved. It also means faster search/display capabilities, and the ability to serve your news in different 'templates' without any hassle. Requirements ? A server that can run PHP4, and a MySQL database (you can install b2 in an already existing database, and you can put several b2's in one database). Where can I download it ? b2 0.6 is the latest public release. You can also visit the CVS server for the latest code, at your own risks. See the ReadMe file for requirements and installation instructions. Contact info ?
