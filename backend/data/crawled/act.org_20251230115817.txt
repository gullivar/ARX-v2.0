WHAT STUDENTS ARE SAYING

I feel like [having more time] significantly helped. When I would do practice tests, I was getting on the edge of the time every single time. This time I had time to review almost every section.

Noah Clements
Grade 11, North Caldwell, NJ

I just kind of wanted to take the science because if I didn't it'd be like the same thing as taking the SAT. I want to go into medicine.

Addison Barnes
Grade 11, Mansfield, TX

When I signed up, I was a little nervous, so when I saw that I had the option, I loved it because I didn't have to be forced to take something that I didn't want to.
