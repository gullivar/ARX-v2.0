How It All Works Together
DATA
CAMPAIGNS
ANALYTICS
First, break down data silos. Engagement connects real-time customer and product data from all sources — website, CRM, data warehouse, offline sources, and more — to create a single customer view. The richer the data, the more engagement, conversions, and CRM revenue you’ll drive.
Then, run personalized campaigns. Unlike tools that separate insights from execution, Engagement gives you data in-platform to launch intelligent campaigns where AI determines the next best action, ideal channel, and perfect timing for every customer — across email, SMS, and more.
Finally, prove the impact. Stop guessing which numbers to trust from siloed tools, and get answers in seconds with Loomi Analytics, our analytics agent. See beyond surface-level revenue to understand customers, LTV, and what drives profitable growth.
