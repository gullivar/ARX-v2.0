DNS resolution error
What happened?

You've requested a page on a website (ross-simons.com) that is on the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare is currently unable to resolve your requested domain (ross-simons.com). There are two potential causes of this:

Most likely: if the owner just signed up for Cloudflare it can take a few minutes for the website's information to be distributed to our global network.
Less likely: something is wrong with this site's configuration. Usually this happens when accounts have been signed up with a partner organization (e.g., a hosting provider) and the provider's DNS fails.

Please see https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-1xxx-errors/error-1001/ for more details.
