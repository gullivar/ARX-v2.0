Meet strangers with your interests!
Omegle (oh`meg`ull) is a great way to meet new friends. When you use Omegle, you are paired randomly with another person to talk one-on-one. If you prefer, you can add your interests and you’ll be randomly paired with someone who selected some of the same interests. To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who you are (not recommended!), and you can stop a chat at any time. See our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines for more info about the do’s and don’ts in using Omegle. Omegle video chat is moderated but no moderation is perfect. Users are solely responsible for their behavior while using Omegle.
