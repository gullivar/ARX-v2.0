Not just a bike, a feeling. 

“If someone wants a sporty, high-speed bike, this may not be the best choice. But for comfort, style and relaxed riding experience. the classic 350 is hard to beat.”

TVS Jupiter 125
4.1 258 reviews
I love Tvs jupiter 

I love my tvs jupiter new model, especially because of oil tank got in front we got more space and design is also good and comforting while i driving.. Pros: 1. Good mileage , i often got 50+ in local area roads. 2. Lot of space 3. Head lights bright and very good experience at night 4. Comfort for log journey also good for me bcoz of big seat space 5. Bike handling and control also smooth Cons: 1. Petrol tank space is less ,I know because of front placing but can improve 2. Vehicle material and finishing may improve, i often got sounds of irritation from acceleration areas beacause of loose body fits 3. In compared to my previous scooty this body not steady while driving 60+ speed that's it. This is all my opinion on my tvs Jupiter 125 from riding past 1 year for more than 10,000 km. Hope You like my review.
