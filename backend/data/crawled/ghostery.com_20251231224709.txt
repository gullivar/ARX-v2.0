Get Ghostery for Chrome FAQ What’s an ad blocker? An ad blocker is a browser extension that prevents ads from loading while you browse the web. It blocks video ads, stops banners, pop ups and other intrusive elements before they appear on the page. Because many ads contain hidden trackers that collect information about what you read or click, an ad blocker also blocks those tracking scripts from loading. By stopping both ads and their embedded trackers, an ad blocker speeds up page loading, reduces data usage, and strengthens your privacy every time you go online. Why is Ghostery better than other ad blockers? Ghostery blocks more than just ads, and this makes it more effective than many other ad blockers. It stops the trackers hidden inside advertising scripts, giving you stronger privacy protection on every page you visit. Ghostery also shows you exactly which companies try to follow you online, offering real transparency rather than working silently in the background. With the Never-Consent feature automatically denying tracking requests inside cookie pop-ups, Ghostery keeps pages cleaner, loads sites faster, and gives you meaningful control over your information from the moment you start browsing. Can I use Ghostery Ad Blocker on different devices? Yes, you can use Ghostery Tracker & Ad Blocker on all your devices. Ghostery works on major desktop and mobile browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari, and Brave. You can install it on as many devices as you like to block ads, stop trackers, and enhance your privacy wherever you browse. Each installation works independently, so you get the same protection whether you are on your laptop, phone, or tablet.
