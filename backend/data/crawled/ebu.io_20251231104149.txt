EBU.io - Inputs & Outputs Sign in Home Services EBU.io Digital Collaboration Hub Deprecation Notice In May 2013, we started building ebu.io as a platform for EBU Members
          and other users to collaborate on open source software development and
          to kick-start projects under the umbrella of EBU Technology &
          Innovation. ebu.io offered a 'home' for these projects and various technical
          modules, including authentication and user management. With the
          adoption of OAuth 2.0, the widespread use of cloud infrastructures and
          the advancement of other web technologies, ebu.io has become
          redundant. In 2022, the ebu.io projects 'home' and technical modules
          have been removed for all projects, except for the RadioDNS project. Further note that the EBU QC Tool and the EBU Gitlab repositories
          continue to exist (standalone) under the following URLs: https://git.ebu.io https://qc.ebu.io © 2025 EBU - Privacy & Cookie Policy
