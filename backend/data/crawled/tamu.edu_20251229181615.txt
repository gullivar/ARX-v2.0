Standing Together For Good

At Texas A&M University, we stand to be the best for the world. Since 1876, Aggies have answered the call to lead with character and serve with compassion — for Texas, the nation and beyond.

Our research drives solutions that matter: from disaster preparedness and agriculture to immersive technology, robotics, leadership and civics. Our students leave prepared to create anything possible — equipped with knowledge, shaped by values and committed to serving for the good of our communities.

This is what it means to be an Aggie: to stand together as a force for good.
