What's nPerf speed test ? How does it work ?

Download bitrate

Indicates the amount of data your connection can receive in one second from the nPerf server. The highest the measured value, the best is the bitrate of your connection.

Upload bitrate

Indicates the amount of data your connection can send in one second to the nPerf server. The highest the measured value, the best is the bitrate of your connection.

Latency (ping)

Indicates the delay a small packet of data requires to make a round-trip from your computer to the nPerf server. The shorter the delay, the most reactive is your connection.

nPerf qualify accurately your internet connection's performances.

This speed test relies on an exclusive algorithm allowing you to measure accurately download bitrate, upload bitrate and latency of your connection.

nPerf uses a worldwide dedicated servers network, which is optimized to deliver enough bitrate to saturate your connection, so that we can measure its bitrate accurately.

nPerf speed test is compatible with all broadband and mobile connections: ADSL, VDSL, cable, optical fiber FTTH / FTTB, satellite, wifi, wimax, cellular 2G / 3G / 4G (LTE), 5G.

The nPerf speed test has been designed by telecom enthusiasts to enable you to accurately measure the speed of your Internet connection easily, in only one click! Oh... and this speed test is absolutely free of ads! Enjoy it ... and if you like it, spread the word :)
