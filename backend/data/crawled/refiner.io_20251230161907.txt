Alexander Schneekloth

Co-Founder

We discovered Refiner while using another SaaS product and we instantly fell in love with their UI / UX. So we gave it a go and were collecting user feedback for SnapShooter in no time. We are using Refiner to collect insights about how our users discovered us. The Slack notifications when someone completes a survey are a great addition to keep the team informed.

Simon Bennett

Founder

We were looking for an in-app survey solution for our product that could flawlessly be synced with Segment. Refiner is the only solution we found that addresses data integrations as a main feature and not as an afterthought. Refiner is an incredibly flexible tool that can be used by nearly every team at Livestorm: growth and marketing, product, customer experience and support, and even sales.

Thibaut Davoult

We looked at various NPS solutions but Refiner was the only one which was built from the ground up to meet the needs of SaaS companies. Refiner gives us complete flexibility and their surveys match our UI/UX 100%.

Refiner was the only in-app survey tool that met all our requirements. Its focus on in-app surveys provides a streamlined feature set that fits our needs perfectly. We appreciate the easy integration via Google Tag Manager, allowing us to use data from our data layer and trigger surveys with GA events. Thanks to the Zapier integration, we seamlessly integrate Refiner into our automated feedback processing workflows.

We love using Refiner to automatically gather NPS survey results and get critical feedback we need from our trial users so we can constantly improve our word of mouth flywheel. With its Segment and Zapier integrations it fits right into our product led growth tech stack. Easy to install, tons of value and zero hassle.

Paul Yacoubian

Founder, CEO

Refiner is a powerful in-app survey tool that allows to precisely target user segments based on our data. We tested several tools before going to Refiner and what made the big difference is that with Refiner every survey answer is directly logged into our database via Segment, and that’s a game changer! Also, the initial integration and setup were seamless and extremely easy. The templates and the ability to customize survey with our own branding and targeting specs is very much appreciated too.

Thriday uses Refiner to improve their platform during beta and gets a whopping 57.7% response rate

“If we see something that needs some work, then we’ll go on and do a couple of sprints on adding some more functionality or ironing out some little bugs or whatever it is we discover from customer feedback. And then once we’ve implemented those changes, we can then go and see how it changed the customer effort score to know we improved the feature in a measurable way.”
