Why choose Cryout Creations?

We like to believe that
coding with a smile helps keep the bugs away.

Small team

It's just us, the developers – we don't get middlemen to handle things for us. So whenever you're asking a question on our site, you're getting the answer straight from the creators.

WordPress experience

We have it. Whether in the form of WordPress themes, plugins, custom coding or theme customization, it's what we've been doing for quite a while now. And we love it!

Long lifecycles

We never retire our WordPress themes. We stand behind them all the way. They're constantly updated and upgraded to the latest design trends, web standards and WordPress versions.

No shortcuts

Our free WordPress themes and plugins are live at WordPress.org. That means we're always using core WordPress features and functionality to get things done and that guarantees stability, performance and most importantly – security!

User input

Our creations have always benefited from user feedback. We bring them to life but it's the users that make them shine. Tweaks, new options, minor or even major features are constantly added as a result of this feedback.

Customization

There's more than meets the eye with our free WordPress themes. What you see in the screenshots or live demos is but one of the virtually unlimited number of personas you can create using the extensive theme options included.
