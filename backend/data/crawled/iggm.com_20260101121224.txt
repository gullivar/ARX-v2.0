After its release, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 received much criticism from players. While its single-player campaign was quite poor and the core systems offered little improvement, its Zombies mode remained high-quality. However, player feedback indicates a declining interest in Zombies mode. This isn't to criticize the mode's performance in Black Ops 7, but rather to analyze some of the problems that have arisen and potential areas for improvement . Development Team The root of the problems can be traced back to 2021, when Zombies development team was placed in a leadership position overseeing the entire Call of Duty series. This meant they not only had to manage their own projects but also assist other studios, even handling Warzone content, undoubtedly leading to team burnout. Furthermore, the unified of the game engine has led to increasing similarities between Zombies and other gameplay modes like Warzone. The official apology was recently issued, confirming that they will avoid resembling Modern Warfare or Black Ops in the future, suggesting that the future development of Zombies may be even better than in previous years. Narrative Regression While the narrative in Zombies mode has actually improved, especially the environmental storytelling within maps, which far surpasses Cold War and Black Ops 6, its pacing remains a significant issue. This problem is similar to Black Ops 6. The opening cutscenes for BO7's first map were very engaging, but subsequent cutscenes only provided substantial plot progression towards the end of the season. Although the developers promised opening animations for each new turn-based map, this hasn't fundamentally solved the narrative problem. Take the opening of Astra Malorum map as an example: it's visually stunning, but the characters lack dialogue, which is one of the charms of past Zombies modes. Character interactions in cutscenes, in-map dialogue, and Easter egg sequences collectively create a coherent narrative experience. The narratives in CoD Black Ops 6 and 7 feel slow-paced and lack sufficient information. While Cold War had few cutscenes, its top-tier Intel system laid a solid foundation for Dark Aether storyline, which unfortunately wasn't fully realized in CoD Vanguard, Modern Warfare 3, or even CoD Black Ops 6 and 7. Astra Malorum Direct evidence of the decline of Zombies mode is players have shown significantly less interest in Astra Malorum DLC map. This is actually a very good map, with a challenging main Easter egg, a difficult boss fight, and excellent visual presentation. However, the hype surrounding Astra Malorum is probably the lowest since Black Ops 4. Besides the aforementioned gameplay and narrative fatigue, this also reflects the fatigue caused by releasing multiple sub-series titles in Black Ops series. Players until recently discovered a side quest Easter egg in Astra Malorumthat rewards Ray Gun . The fact that such an attractive reward took so long to be discovered suggests that not enough players are currently exploring this map. Insufficient Rewards For a title like Black Ops 7, released so close to its predecessor, the key is to ensure the endgame content is engaging. This refers to progression, secrets, and new items, not necessarily new modes. The endgame needs to offer sufficient rewards for hardcore zombie players and anyone wanting to try and improve their skills. Currently, the biggest problem with Zombies mode is the reward system. Relics hunt in Cursed mode is almost untouched because players can already directly activate Tier 3 Curses with Relics obtained from Ashes of the Damned map. So, besides experiencing different difficulty modifications, what incentive is there for players to challenge themselves for 40 or 60 rounds to obtain more Relics? Players can already obtain Tier 4 Pack-a-Punch, ultra-rare weapons, or Golden Armor through other means. In fact, the game practically has a ready-made solution, but it's been overlooked. If players collect enough relics on a specific map and complete the main Easter egg while it's active, they can obtain a Universal Pack-a-Punch Camo . This system already exists in the menu, but it only allows switching skin displays during matches, which is a huge waste. If this reward were a legitimate camouflage, it would not only incentivize hardcore players to challenge themselves but also attract multiplayer and Warzone players to Zombie mode and challenge Easter eggs in Cursed mode for the cool camouflage. Cursed mode itself has a good concept; it successfully extends the playable lifespan of maps. However, the current problem is that the rewards for high-difficulty challenges are insufficient. This leads to a lack of motivation for hardcore players to challenge themselves, while casual players give up due to the difficulty. How to Solve This? To solve this problem, the reward issue must be addressed first. Only with sufficiently generous rewards can enough players be attracted. Currently, unlocking Relics camouflage is similar to finding a menu; players need to find the unlocking method themselves. If the system could be changed so that when players equip Relics, the unlock conditions are explicitly stated, this would incentivize players to challenge themselves with more difficult content to achieve their goals. Furthermore, each map should have an Easter egg unlocked by activating a specific Relic combination obtained from that map. If only fixed rewards like Golden Armor are available throughout the year, player interest will only continue to decline. Building on this, increasing rewards and adding dialogue to cutscenes could reignite player interest in Zombies mode. The Zombies mode in CoD BO7 doesn't need major overhauls. Completely revamping the gameplay can be left for future Call of Duty titles. The current goal is to address the aforementioned issues and reignite community interest as we enter the new year. Black Ops 7 x Fallout Collaboration Explained: Release Date, LTMs, Nuketown Variant & More Predictions As CoD Black Ops 7 Season 1 approaches its mid-season point, a new Reloaded Update is on the horizon, bringing with it new limited-time modes, weapons, maps, and more. However, the most significant part of this update is undoubtedly Call of Duty and Fallout collaboration, one of their first updates in 2026, which will set the tone for almost the entire year's worth of game content. So, what can you expect from this BO7 x Fallout collaboration ? Will it be as underwhelming as Black Ops 7 and Squid Game collaboration? Here's a breakdown of all the major updates in this event! Release Date Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Fallout collaboration is expected to officially launch on January 8, 2026, in the game's Season 1 Reloaded update, bringing with it operators such as Maximus, Lucy, and The Ghoul in Power Armor, as well as a Fallout Mojave Desert-themed Nuketown map variant . Notably, this collaboration will offer not only a paid event pass but also a free rewards track, including free operators, camos, and DLC weapons. This collaboration coincides with December 16th premiere of the second season of Fallout TV series, and is sure to satisfy many players' desire for immersive gameplay, allowing them to experience combat and survival in a post-apocalyptic world. Fallout-themed Nuketown Variant Before we begin, we must issue a disclaimer: since the developers haven't released all the details yet, the information we have is based on trailers that only show silhouettes. Therefore, the final actual event content may differ from the current predictions. In this collaboration, Call of Duty has prepared new content for almost every mode. In multiplayer mode, we have a Fallout-themed Nuketown variant map. Nuketown seems to be updated into a radiation-contaminated Fallout theme, which has been confirmed by two different sources: one is the official Call of Duty podcast stating that there will be a new variant map, and the other is the appearance of Nuketown in the background of Call of Duty trailer. So, it will undoubtedly be a Fallout-themed map. However, we speculate that there might be some small Easter eggs waiting for us to discover, such as the mannequin Easter Egg. Since we haven't found this Easter egg on Nuketown map yet, we speculate that they might have reserved these Easter eggs for this variant map and will include some Fallout-related elements. We also considered another possibility: perhaps this Nuketown variant will be like Las Vegas in Fallout series, where radiation dust storms might occasionally appear on the map, requiring players to seek cover, such as hiding in buildings or engaging enemies directly through underground passages. This fits perfectly with the overall Fallout theme. Therefore, we can expect to see similar designs in this variant version of Nuketown map. Power Armor-themed Multiplayer Limited-Time Mode (LTM) In addition to the map variant, a Limited-Time Mode (LTM) will also be added to multiplayer. When we first heard this news, we thought of Warhammer 40,000 crossover event in Modern Warfare III, so is it possible that they will also release a Power Armor mode this time? That is, one Power Armor team against another Power Armor team. Players will be able to move freely on the map using a third-person perspective, similar to Warhammer LTM, using various equipment from Fallout series and engaging in combat. Since this mode was playable on almost all maps in MW3, they can likely implement this mode on almost any map this time as well. We believe that even if you are not a fan of Fallout series, you will enjoy this limited-time mode, experiencing something fresh and different. Fallout-themed World Boss Next, in Endgame mode, they might introduce a new World Boss battle. In the previously leaked trailer, we saw a Power Armor helmet icon. If this leaked image is true, they may have plans for something similar to a mini-boss battle that players can challenge or confront. Perhaps they will require players to wear Power Armor and then fight a larger boss. There might be some special Power Armor weapon crates that provide blueprints, allowing players to use weapons from Fallout series in Endgame mode. Zombies Limited-Time Mode (LTM) For Zombies mode, a limited-time mode is also expected. However, not much information has been revealed yet. So, we speculate that they will probably release a game similar to Red Light, Green Light game from the previous Squid Game collaboration. To be honest, I don't think they'll drastically change the map and introduce new variants, as they've already done something similar in Astra Malorum Christmas limited-time mode, so making major changes now wouldn't be a very wise decision. However, it would be more reasonable if they only made changes to a specific area of the map. For example, Barn area looks a bit like Fallout style, and they could design something along those lines. Warzone Fallout Themed Update The last and most mysterious mode in all the modes is Warzone collaboration update. Currently, they haven't revealed any relevant information, so we can only make reasonable inferences based on previous events. For example, they might introduce a limited-time mode similar to the previous Get High mode, adding sandstorms, forcing players to seek cover and scavenge for extra loot; or some limited-time modes that provide power-ups, where you can gain abilities such as super jumps, laser vision, or flight. They might also add similar changes to Fallout-themed mode. One location could be completely filled with Fallout elements, which would attract many people to land in that area. It could become a popular landing spot where players can get better loot and have more opportunities to engage in gunfights, instead of the game becoming boring and tedious at a certain stage, as in the normal mode. In such a location, the fighting would always be continuous. In short, the above is all the new content we know about CoD Black Ops 7 x Fallout event based on current leaks and trailers, and it's not yet ultimate confirmation. So, what are your thoughts and opinions on this Fallout collaboration? From the looks of it, Call of Duty is likely to do something really great this time. Hopefully, they can set a new benchmark with this collaboration, so we can expect similar levels of quality in future collaborations. View More > Trustpilot  Reviews Trustpilot Why Choose IGGM.COM?
