Little , LCSW Rated 4.8 stars out of 5 4.8 (60) , 60 ratings + 13 more Frequently asked questions Why filter by state rather than in a city? When looking for online therapy, you can see anyone that is credentialed in the state. We want you to find the best fit, therefore, Grow Therapy shows available therapists across the entire state. If you'd rather see someone in-person, you can change the filter from virtual and find a therapist near your address. Will providers take my insurance? When booking you'll be asked to verify with your Member ID. However, if you don't have any of the insurances available you can select cash. Our therapists will have their cost of appointment on their profile. Individual session costs will vary. Are there therapists who focus on specific issues? You don't need to select any of the Needs to find a therapist, but if you have knowledge or experience about what specifically you may need then feel to explore all the filters we have available. What happens during the first therapy session? Your first therapy session is for you and your therapist to meet each other and to ask any questions that you have about the counseling process. This is where you can expect your therapist to do the same as they will ask questions to gain insight into your specific situation. In this first session the therapist is doing their part to gather as much information so they can better assess if they are able to meet your therapeutic needs. 

 Depending upon your provider's specialty, you may also discuss the methods the therapist will use.   For additional information on therapy methods, please visit the Grow Therapy Help Center . Some people feel nervous before their first appointment, and that is totally normal! Coming prepared with a list of questions for your therapist may help. Remember, you're taking a brave step by seeking therapy, and it is okay to be nervous as you try something new.
