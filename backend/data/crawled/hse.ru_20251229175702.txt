Student Voices

The HSE alumni network has been incredibly supportive. It connects students and professionals from around the world who share similar experiences. I’ve met many alumni who have offered advice, mentorship, and even research collaborations, both in academia and industry.

Warda Tariq (Pakistan), Master’s Programme in Data Science

I chose HSE University because of its academic excellence and international recognition. The university offers a strong Russian language programme and many opportunities for personal and professional growth.

Nguyen Xuan Thanh (Vietnam), HSE Preparatory Year

One of the things I find truly unique about the academic process at HSE is the composition of the teaching staff: it is a balanced mix of theorists and practicing professionals.

Dilmurod Kholmatov (Uzbekistan), Master’s Programme in Law of International Trade and Dispute Resolution

HSE University offers a globally competitive curriculum and has strong collaborations with international institutions. The research opportunities and the chance to work on real-world projects were key factors that motivated me to choose my programme at HSE.

Kartik Joshi (India), Master's Programme in Data Science

HSE has broadened my academic perspective and deepened my interest in research. It has helped me become more confident in my skills, more open to interdisciplinary work, and more determined to contribute meaningfully to the field of language education and applied linguistics.

Mujing Raissa Mij (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Master’s Programme in Linguistic Theory and Language Description

I liked the approach that always challenged you to learn more. Every course encouraged us to do some research on our own. My research skills helped me a lot in my career.

Luis Santaella (Mexico), Bachelor’s Programme 'Political Science and World Politics'

HSE has a lively and international academic atmosphere that encourages critical thinking and interdisciplinary learning. I like how classes are structured to promote discussion rather than just passive learning. There’s a strong emphasis on research, so students are encouraged to explore their own interests and develop analytical skills.
