Just a Few Words From Our Clients "Just now I upgraded some software on my server and broke something else in the process, resulting in a number of my client sites being down. Of course I went right to the Help Desk to cry Help! TCH got right on my case and fixed it. And gave me some instruction about how to prevent this from happening next time!" Jim Butterfield (Pro Web Developer) “I have been with totalchoice hosting for 16 years or so and their customer service is the best! Many times when I contact support for something that's not within their purview, they send me a link where I can get my question answered, even if it has something to do with Wordpress. That is above and beyond, in my opinion!” Ms. Litsey (Professional Blogger) "Submitted a help desk ticket this morning at 8:12. Nine minutes later, Bryan Abraham responded, advising that the problem was resolved. I have been a customer now for almost 10 years, while I have always been happy with the level of service that TCH provides, I think that is a record for fast response to a trouble ticket." Bob Crabb (Business Owner) “I'm still blown away by this company, after all those years! In a good way, rest assured. Do not ever take the TCH family and support people for granted. What they do for you and are willing to do for you, you will NOT find anywhere else. I trust TotalChoice Hosting with my business more than any other hosting company!"
