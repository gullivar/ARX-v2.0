THE EVER-EVOLVING COMMUNITY OF EVE
NEW EDEN’S HEART AND SOUL

Since May of 2003, EVE Online has continually brought capsuleers across the world together in a universe of meaningful interaction, where cooperation and friendship are the keys to both fun and fortune – fueling a community unlike any other in the wide world of online gaming. This also extends beyond the screen, with official events such as EVE Fanfest in Reykjavik, Iceland and player gatherings around the world bringing players and developers alike together to reminisce and party, with old comrades and enemies alike, and forge new connections with fellow space friends!

The EVE community also plays a vital role in the game’s development through the Council of Stellar Management (CSM), a democratically elected player council that meets with developers and provides essential feedback on features and content for the world of EVE. We also welcome EVE content creators of all kinds to join the Partnership Program to be rewarded for their passion and creativity.

Additionally, the EVE Community Team and other developers engage with players daily on Discord and regularly stream on the CCP TV twitch channel – and the EVE Help Center is at your service 24/7 in every supported language. Embark into New Eden and find your place in the incomparable community of EVE Online. We'll see you in space, capsuleer!
