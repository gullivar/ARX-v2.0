Entity Linking A new feature enabling disambiguation of mathematical entities
                has been launched on zbMATH Open. Abstracts and reviews are
                enrichted by adding links to mathematical concepts, directing
                users to relevant entries on Wikipedia or other sources. Geodesic Links and EMIS Integration zbMATH Open has integrated over 100,000 links to free full-text
                articles curated by the Geodesic platform .
                Additionally, the service now includes full-text PDFs from EMIS journals . EMIS, a pioneering online platform established in the 1990s,
                served as a central hub for electronic mathematics resources in
                Europe. Over time, its services were gradually absorbed into
                other platforms, leading to the eventual discontinuation of the EMIS website . © 2025 FIZ Karlsruhe GmbH Privacy Policy Legal Notices Terms & Conditions (opens in new tab)
