View PTO Customer Success Stories 1242 Customer Reviews 4.7 Average Rating Safiya - OnTheClock Customer OTC simply rocks! “ I have been using OTC for about two years now. Not only is the platform super easy to use and accessible from anywhere in the world, but OnTheClock staff are super friendly, helpful and very understanding. Thank you so much OnTheClock... you rock! ” Jeff - OnTheClock Customer On the Clock is ideal for even small businesses! “ On the Clock turned out to be an excellent choice for us. Our staff can clock in wherever they are when they start work. Our office manager has simple, complete reporting the way she wants it. We spend less than 15 minutes a week figuring and writing paychecks. And the price is quite fair for smaller companies. We are definitely fans! ” Nicole - OnTheClock Customer Time Saver / Life Saver “ Before OnTheClock our timesheets were a mess. We have employees that travel and were always forgetting to log their hours. This product is amazing! They now have their timesheets right on their phone and can clock in and out from wherever they’re at. The PTO tracker is a real timesaver! Our employees can check how much PTO they have left, without me constantly pulling a file. And it can be submitted and approved with a click of a button. The cost is so affordable and well worth it! ” Marie - OnTheClock Customer We love OnTheClock.com! “ We stumbled by accident upon OnTheClock.com and could not be more glad we did. Super easy to use, the reports are great, the price and service is excellent. Could not recommend more! ” Read Testimonials Case Studies You're 2 minutes away from an easy-to-use time clock that saves you hundreds of hours each year Still not sure?
