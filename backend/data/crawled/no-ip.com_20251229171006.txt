What is DDNS?

Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that automatically updates your domain name to match your changing IP address. Most home internet connections use dynamic IPs, which can make it hard to remotely access your networked devices. That’s where DDNS comes in.

What is Managed DNS?

Managed DNS is a service that routes traffic to your domain name using a global network of authoritative DNS servers. Instead of running and maintaining your own DNS infrastructure, managed DNS lets you rely on a fast, secure, and redundant platform built for performance and uptime.
