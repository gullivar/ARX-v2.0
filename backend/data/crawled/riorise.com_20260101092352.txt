Car Game This Brazil-themed RP game is primarily a car game, where you can drive around the city and modify cars to your liking. For those using the unlimited money option, it's possible to buy multiple cars, tweak them all, and use them to complete missions around the city. And best of all: there are plenty of Brazilian cars available to simulate life here in an even more immersive way. RioRise is a true car simulator with a career option in the world of crime or alongside the police. The game is available for Android, and the APK download is provided on the official server website via your browser. The unlimited money setting can be easily configured by the player on their mobile device. Game Motorcycles A life simulator in Brazil wouldn't be complete without motorcycles available to players. In addition to cars, you can ride motorcycles through the Brazilian landscape, and even swap and customize them. Again, the unlimited money option can be very helpful here, although the career path becomes more interesting when done 'the hard way'. To start playing, you need to download the installation APK from the official website. When you visit the site using your device's browser, there is a clearly visible green download button in the center of the screen. Clicking it will likely prompt your phone to ask for download confirmation. Feel free to authorize it. Once the file is downloaded, simply locate the APK in your device's files (if the pop-up doesn't appear) and begin the installation process. Police (and Thief) Game In this Android game, you have two career options, but you can also play freely to enjoy the city. The two career options are Crime and Police. In the world of crime, you can (and should) evade the police to complete missions and reach high ranks in the mafia. Playing on the police side, it's the mafia members who try to escape you, and a police cruiser can be used for capture. The vehicles are even identical to those used by the Brazilian police. The thrill of storming a favela to arrest criminals and gain status in the police force is definitely one of the highlights of the game. Life Simulation Game RioRise is an all-in-one real-life game. Your customizable avatar is a free character who can choose a career to progress through missions or simply cruise the city and have fun in the themed setting of Rio de Janeiro — which also features architectural influences from São Paulo and other Brazilian cities. This mobile game is a virtual life simulator, but not just any life. The context is Brazilian, and every element of the game is related to the local setting. By downloading the game for Android, the best part is that you are free to do almost anything and enjoy the experience of a virtual, exciting Brazilian life.
