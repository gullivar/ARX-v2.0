It usually begins in the last days of August and ends in the second half of September. Together with the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France, the Vuelta stands out among other cycling competitions, has its own traditions, history and has long attracted the attention of many sports fans online pokies australia. This year, the race will be held from August 23 to September 14. The total length of all stages will be 3151 kilometers. It is noteworthy that in 2025 the Spanish Grand Tour will not look into the southern regions of the Iberian Peninsula. The first three stages will take place on the Costa Blanca, in the province of Alicante (Valencia region). In the future, the peloton will move north using the roads of Valencia, Aragon and Catalonia. By the end of the first week, competitors will get to Andorra, and then they will visit France. Upon returning to Spain, the Vuelta will glance into Navarre, the Basque Country, Cantabria and Asturias. The last days will pass along the roads of Castile-La Mancha, Castile-Leon and Madrid. Once again, the Spanish super race will end in the capital of the country. What is Vuelta? For those unfamiliar with the sport of cycling, Grand Tour implies a lengthy and gruelling three-week event covering almost the entire country. The Vuelta 2025 a Espana (or translated into English as the Tour of Spain) is one of the three Grand Tours in the world. Tour de France, which takes place in France, and Giro d’Italia, a similar version in Italy, are the other two major events of such a nature. La Vuelta 2025 will be the 80 edition of the event, which was first organised in 1935. Vuelta a Espana 2024 Recap Primoz Roglic of the Slovenian Racing team managed to win his first ever Grand Tour title. The red jersey, which is awarded to the winners of the Vuelta a Espana, was handed over to the Italian, as he managed to maintain an overall lead even after John Degenkolb’s success towards the end of the race. Degenkolb managed to win the final stage in Madrid after an excellent sprint. The overall results of the Tour of Spain 2018 turned out to be a major surprise since many expected the likes of Alberto Contador of Tinkoff–Saxo, Chris Froome of Team Sky, Alejandro Valverde and Nairo Quintana of Movistar Team, and Vincenzo Nibali of Astana to be successful. After all, these riders had the experience of winning Grand Tours in the past. A gruelling season combined with a focus on other titles led to a majority of these contenders dropping out. Seasoned punters and bookmakers will be aware that such Grand Tours are invariably won on the hilly and mountainous stages. Aru was impressive from stage 11 to 15 – which encompassed a majority of the hilly stages. Movistar Team, who had two riders as pretournament favourites, may not have witnessed the riders make it into the top three of the general classification results, but they came out on top in the team classification results.

Vuelta a Espana 2025 Favourites As soon as the group stages for the Vuelta 2025 came through the Vuelta news, it became apparent that riders who do well on flights and hilly stages have a great opportunity to win the title. Compared with the 2018 edition which had six clear-cut high mountainous stages, La Vuelta 2025 only has three high mountainous stages – Lugones – Lagos de Covadonga, Urdatx-D
antxarinea – Aubisque, and Benidorm – Alto de Aitana. The rest of the race is dominated by medium mountain and hilly stages. It would be no surprise to see a majority of the front runners like Chris Froome and Alberto Contador once again being ranked as the favourites for the title. It is highly unlikely that Aru – even with the experience from 2018 – would be considered as a good racer to defend the title. Vuelta 2025, though, could throw in a surprise just like the 2018 edition.
