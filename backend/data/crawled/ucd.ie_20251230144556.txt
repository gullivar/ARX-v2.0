🧑🎓🦄 Unicorn Status: New York-based fintech Imprint, co-founded by UCD Sutherland School of Law law graduate Daragh Murphy, has reached a $1.2bn valuation following a $150m Series D funding round.

Founded in 2020 by Murphy and Gaurav Ahuja, Imprint partners with leading global brands to design and manage co-branded credit card programmes, helping companies build stronger, more rewarding customer relationships.

Now working with major names including Booking.com and Rakuten, the company has seen rapid growth, reporting a 200% year-on-year increase in its cardholder base.

The latest investment will support Imprint’s expansion beyond credit into new financial products, as well as the continued development of its technology platform and use of AI to scale its services.

After finishing his Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) at UCD Sutherland School of Law, Daragh completed a Master of Laws (LL.M.) at Duke University School of Law, graduating Magna Cum Laude.

Warmest congratulations to Darragh and the Imprint team on achieving unicorn status.

🎄❄️ Nollaig Shona agus Athbhliain faoi Mhaise ❄️ 🎄

As the year draws to a close, this latest edition of the Bloom shows University College Dublin remains as active as ever. From research advancing AI in healthcare and agriculture to Ukrainian President Zelensky honouring UCD-led trauma care training of first responders, campus life continues to thrive.

We celebrate the success of “Rising Star” Ad Astra Academy sailing ace Eve McMahon at the Olympic Sport Awards, and raise a glass to Ireland’s bogs with a new series of illustrated beer mats championing the biodiversity and history preserved by Ireland’s peatlands.

With this, our last edition for 2025, we also wish all our readers a peaceful and joyful holiday season.

👨‍🌾💰 Many congratulations to Assistant Professor Dimitrios Argyropoulos, who has secured €6.5m in Horizon Europe-backed funding for the UCD-led AI project AGROBOOST.

Leveraging advanced robotics, AI, and augmented reality, the project aims to modernise agriculture, combat labour shortages, and prioritise worker safety.

This funding will assist AGROBOOST in enhancing farm safety, intelligence, and appeal, particularly for women, youth, and workers with disabilities. The aim is to reduce workplace accidents by 30% and to demonstrate improved inclusivity among those pursuing farming careers.

Dr Argyropoulos, from the UCD School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, will lead the multi-disciplinary European project involving 18 partners.

🗣️ “AGROBOOST embraces a methodology rooted in scientific excellence, social inclusivity, and measurable impact, prioritising the safety and appeal of agricultural work by harnessing robotics, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, automation and digitalisation while simultaneously aiming for significant reductions in workplace accidents, environmental footprint, and production costs."
- Dr Dimitrios Argyropoulos

It will seek to address highly challenging agricultural tasks directly through six pilot campaigns. These include:

🍄 Mushroom selective harvesting (Ireland) using fully autonomous, vision-guided robots
🤖 Intelligent Autonomous Robotic System for Harvesting of Strawberries Crops (UK) utilising a gamified Virtual Reality (VR) environment for training and telepresence
🍎 Orchard tree pruning and flower thinning (Portugal) leveraging AI-based robotic systems
🌱 Mechanical Autonomous Selective Weeding (Greece) in organic vegetable farming
🐓 Autonomous Management of Poultry Production, Health and Welfare (Belgium) using combined fixed and mobile robotic platforms
🍷 Automated Work on the Ground in Steep Vineyards (Switzerland), exploring lightweight, morphing compliant robots to reduce human intervention in challenging terrain

Another part of the project is €480,000 in financial support to integrate external innovation from third parties, such as SMEs, startups, and research groups, through two open funding calls, providing up to €60,000 to each of the planned eight recipients.

The story of Ireland’s peatlands are being told through a new series of illustrated beer mats celebrating the biodiversity and history preserved by Irish’s bogs.

Developed by Dr Shane McGuinness, Climate Fellow at the UCD Earth Institute, and colleagues from University College Cork, in collaboration with artist Eleanor Brayden, the beer mats feature bold artwork and bite-sized facts about Ireland’s unique peatland heritage.

Ancient artefacts such as the Brockagh Bronze Age axe and the Ralaghan figurine sit alongside ecological treasures including the carnivorous sundew plant and Devil’s Matchstick lichen.

Each mat also includes a QR code linking to further stories, images and research insights on Ireland’s peatlands.

“While peatlands have been seen as wastelands or a source of fuel in the past, they’re becoming increasingly valued for climate action, biodiversity and water,” he said.

"We’re delighted to be bringing this message to an unconventional venue – giving the public a snapshot of the wealth and wonder of Ireland’s peatlands during the festive season,” said Dr McGuinnes.

#UCD_Ai stories 🔸 Leading Ireland to the next frontiers of computing and data sciences 🔹

The rapid acceleration of artificial intelligence over the past decade has demanded a step-change in how universities conduct research, build talent pipelines, and translate breakthroughs into real-world impact. At UCD, this transformation has been a priority.

With the largest concentration of researchers in AI and data science and the most powerful infrastructure for AI, UCD is Ireland's leading university in artificial intelligence research and innovation. UCD School of Computer Science is home to leading experts in key areas including security, data science, machine learning, AI, digital health, foundations of computing, human-computer interaction, information systems, intelligent sensing and multimedia technologies - as well as being Ireland's centre of gravity for large-scale AI research.

UCD School of Mathematics and Statistics, meanwhile, is shaping how the university and wider research community thinks about artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science. Its leading researchers drive programmes and collaborations that power discovery across health, climate, finance, agri-food and beyond, leading the charge in established and emerging fields such as fluid dynamics, numerical methodologies, network modelling and causal inference in AI.

🧑🎓✨ Mission accomplished! Many congratulations to UCD Lochlann Quinn School of Business graduate and Lidl GB CEO Ryan McDonnell on the opening of the retailer’s 1,000th store in the UK.

Ryan, who studied German and Business at University College Dublin, has spent most of his career with Lidl, including roles in Germany and Austria, before taking over as chief executive of Lidl UK in 2022.

He has overseen Lidl UK's major expansion programme and delivered its target of 1,000 stores by the end of 2025.

Reflecting on the achievement, Ryan said:

"Seeing colleagues and the wider community come together made one thing clear: this achievement belongs to everyone who’s been part of our journey.
 
When we opened our first store in 1994, we set out with a simple belief – to deliver meaningful value for our customers."

Congratulations, Ryan!
