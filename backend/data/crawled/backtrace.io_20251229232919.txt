Devs  Backtrace
Fred Gill
Technical Director at Respawn Entertainment

“We recently started ingesting crashes from one of our PS4 games into Backtrace, and we now have a single place where we can view all quality issues impacting Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order across desktop and game consoles. This visibility will help propel our software quality management practices to the next level.”

Christopher Swiedler
Senior Engineer, Roblox

“Backtrace has cut down on the time it takes to generate crash reports while increasing their accuracy. It’s nice to be able to send people links to Backtrace crash reports and searches.”

Nicolas “Rikus” Maier
CTO, Nimble Giant

"Only a mad person would try to develop and release a videogame without using Backtrace. You will save a lot of time, frustration and really bad experiences. On another note, we stopped using the phrase ‘if it only happened once then there’s no bug’ because it’s there, it’s on Backtrace, the bug exists, it happened once and it will happen again, now we know how to fix it.”

Brent Lamb
Senior Producer, Perfect World

"Backtrace has changed the way we explore and use crash data. Everyone feels comfortable running queries and understanding the health of our games."
