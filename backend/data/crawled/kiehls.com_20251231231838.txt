Kiehl's Since 1851: Skincare for All Skin Types. 100% Paraben-Free.

At Kiehl's, our mission is to formulate gentle yet effective skincare products like we have for the past 171 years. Whether it's our innovative, paraben-free formulas, use of cutting-edge ingredients, or commitment to sustainable packaging, our dedication to helping you achieve a healthy skin barrier has always aligned with our commitment to the health of our planet. We have come a long way from our old-world apothecary days in New York's East Village, but our expert approach to skincare and strong brand values have and always will remain the same.
