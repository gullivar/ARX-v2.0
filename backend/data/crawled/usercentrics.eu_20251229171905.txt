It’s important to us to guarantee our users a data protection-compliant online shopping experience and display all cookie information transparently. Meeting regional legal requirements is also important. We chose Usercentrics because it meets the highest data protection standards, offers an intuitive user interface with great features, and was easy to integrate into our system. Working with the Usercentrics team has meant having a great partner at our side who supports us quickly and reliably with every question and new project.

Alix Courdier
Head of Marketing Tech
Cookie compliance is crucial for ensuring data privacy and building trust with consumers. We chose Usercentrics CMP for its ability to provide harmonized compliance and marketing. We use it to manage user consent across various domains and over a dozen apps. The Google Consent Mode integration is also really useful. Since implementing the Usercentrics CMP, the company has experienced better compliance with data privacy regulations, improved user trust, and enhanced marketing capabilities.

“Cookie compliance is important for our business both because of legal obligations and because our audience is particular sensitive about their personal data. The Usercentrics team’s customer-centric approach and proactive support are very important to us both during implementation and on an ongoing basis. The customization and ease of use are great advantages for a group of companies like ours with 30 websites. Smart Data Protector helps us provide information about all of our integrations and ensure the websites are accessible and user-friendly while being GDPR-compliant.”
