We have lots of different types of businesses at our coworking spaces, all with employees, customers, and vendors who need access to the properties. Between the improved tenant experience, increased security, and meaningful time-savings, ButterflyMX is really a no-brainer for us. Tiffany Tanakit PM at Novel Coworking Chicago, IL ButterflyMX integrates with all the other proptech solutions in our buildings. Thanks to ButterflyMX , we’ve created a fully integrated property access and connected living experience that can be controlled from a smartphone and impresses prospective residents. Jonathan Ehrlich Founder at Lightning Capital New York, NY ButterflyMX’s video intercom allows our tenants to see and speak with whoever is trying to gain access to the property through an app on their smartphone or tablet — making them feel safer about who they are granting property access to. I also no longer have to handout and manage keycards or fobs, which saves me time and hassle. Bill Norman Property Manager at BDG Boston, MA With ButterflyMX, residents can open and manage the community gates from their smartphones anywhere in the world. We no longer have to worry about the hassle and expense of handing out and managing fobs, keycards, stickers, or remotes to residents. And since it’s smartphone-based, residents intuitively know how to use it without us having to explain it to them. Jacques Bazinet Chief Operations Officer Scottsdale, AZ Our student-residents live on their smartphones and are accustomed to technology that is on the leading-edge. ButterflyMX's smart intercom fell in line with the experience we've created at The Clubhouse. Its ability to allow our student-residents to see and speak with visitors is more convenient and secure than anything else we looked at on the market, and our student-residents have told me that they feel safer. Yvonne Tomesek Senior PM at Peak Campus Louisville, KY We decided to go with ButterflyMX because they’ve integrated package delivery with visitor entry. It’s a solution that not only streamlines building operations but also helps the property stand out with an amenity that our future residents are looking for. Lindsay Lechner Senior Associate at HSR Pittsburg, PA ButterflyMX’s smart intercom not only has low upfront and ongoing costs but also provides a property access experience built for modern living. We regularly survey our residents for feedback on their living experience, and we’ve found that our ButterflyMX equipped buildings score higher than our non-ButterflyMX equipped buildings. Steve F.
