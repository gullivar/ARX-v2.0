Thank you for great product and great support. Manjit Singh, IT Manager Corporate, Sayaji Group Superior Technology WiFiLAN is a vital part of our operation. We use WiFiLAN for support and for monitoring information. We have about 200 locations that we use to monitor our Wi-Fi systems. It enables us to give various reports to our customers as far as daily login reports , monthly reports, yearly reports and various other reports. I personally have been using WiFiLAN for about seven years. It makes us look very good as a business and very well organized. I've enjoyed over the past seven years working with Wifisoft team. They make it very easy to work with. They are on time doing things we ask. Like specially programing that we need to have done. Customize our reports that we need to have laid out differently. There are so many other functions of WiFiLAN. Companies that do advertising can get even more deeper is customizing and monitoring activities. I have used other monitoring programs, WiFiLAN is by far the best. Tye Wilson, Zoom Info Systems, Inc, USA Great Design Thanks very much. I really like the UniBox so far. You guys have done an excellent job with the design.
