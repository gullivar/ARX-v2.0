"I18n can be scary for any company, but Crowdin made it incredibly easy to onboard and offboard both translators and proofreaders. Without Crowdin’s generous open source plan, we would likely not be supporting over 35 languages in our Cal.com app."

"Crowdin streamlined our translation process with a tight GitLab integration. By automatically presenting new strings to our community for translation, we’re able to save time and get our community engaged quickly. The integration also allows us to immediately present new translations in a new merge request when they get approved by our community proofreaders, helping us integrate new translations quickly. We’re big fans!"
