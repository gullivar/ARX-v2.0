A browser security platform is a cybersecurity solution that protects user activity, data, and applications directly within the web browser—the primary workspace in today’s SaaS-driven, cloud-first environments. As traditional security tools like firewalls, CASBs, and EDRs operate at the network or endpoint level, they often miss threats that occur inside the browser, such as data leakage, malicious extensions, Shadow SaaS usage, and unsafe interactions with GenAI tools. Browser security platforms fill this gap by providing real-time visibility, policy enforcement, and data protection at the session level, making them essential for securing modern hybrid workforces and Zero Trust architectures. What’s the difference between LayerX and Secure Enterprise Browser (SEB) solutions like Island and Talon? LayerX secures any browser through a lightweight extension, while Island and Talon (acquired by Palot Alto Networks and now rebranded as Prisma Access Browser) require replacing users’ browsers entirely—disrupting workflows and hindering adoption. Additionally, enterprise browsers only secure activity within their controlled environment, leaving blindspots like unmanaged devices, personal browser use, Shadow SaaS, and risky extensions. LayerX’s browser-native approach offers full visibility and control across all user activity in real time, without forcing a browser switch. It delivers advanced SaaS DLP, GenAI governance, and extension risk management across managed and BYOD endpoints. This makes LayerX faster to deploy, easier to scale, and far more flexible—providing true enterprise-grade browser security that aligns with the way users actually work today. What’s the difference between LayerX and Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) solutions? Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) solutions work by creating a virtual environment that separates the browser session from the endpoint, aiming to block malware and malicious content from reaching user devices. While effective for preventing certain web-based attacks, isolation often degrades user experience, introduces latency, limits web app functionality, and is difficult to scale across hybrid or BYOD environments. More importantly, it doesn’t address key browser-layer risks like data leakage from SaaS apps, Shadow IT, risky browser extensions, and GenAI misuse since it only targets activities that take place within a live web session . In contrast, browser security platforms like LayerX work directly inside the native browser, providing real-time visibility, granular control, and seamless policy enforcement without disrupting workflows and assuring that the user experience is at the best possible level. Why do I need a browser security platform? In today’s cloud-first, SaaS-heavy work environments, the web browser is the central hub for accessing critical applications and data. Existing security tools often lack visibility into browser activity, creating blind spots that cybercriminals exploit through data exfiltration, malicious extensions, and Shadow SaaS use, etc. A browser security platform is essential because it provides real-time monitoring and control within the browser itself, where most cyber risks occur. This enables organizations to enforce granular security policies, protect sensitive data, and support Zero Trust strategies—closing gaps that conventional tools cannot effectively address. What is the impact of the LayerX browser extension on user browsing experience? LayerX is designed to be a lightweight and non-intrusive extension, with virtually zero impact on the user’s browsing experience. It runs silently in the background without slowing down web performance, altering browser behavior, or interrupting workflows. Users continue working in their preferred browsers with full access to the websites, SaaS apps, and tools they rely on. LayerX only intervenes when enforcing specific security policies—such as blocking risky actions, restricting unsanctioned extensions, or preventing sensitive data leakage—and even then, responses are precise and contextual. This ensures a seamless balance between strong security and uninterrupted productivity. Can LayerX integrate with our existing security infrastructure? Yes, LayerX is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing security ecosystem to enhance protection across web and SaaS environments—without requiring you to rip and replace current solutions. It doesn’t compete with tools like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), Secure Web Gateways (SWG), or Security Service Edge (SSE) platforms. Instead, it complements them by focusing on a blind spot most traditional tools miss: the browser. LayerX is the missing browser-native layer of your Zero Trust architecture. It gives your security stack the ability to see, analyze, and control user activity inside the browser—something most traditional tools were never built to do. How does LayerX provide browser extension security to protect against malicious extensions? Malicious browser extensions are an increasingly dangerous threat vector, often used to exfiltrate data, steal credentials, or gain persistent access to SaaS applications. These extensions can request powerful permissions—such as reading all data on websites—and operate with minimal user awareness. The problem is growing, especially in hybrid and BYOD environments, where traditional security tools like EDRs, CASBs, and SWGs lack visibility and control at the browser layer. LayerX addresses this gap by continuously monitoring all installed extensions across managed and unmanaged devices. It evaluates each extension’s permissions, behavior, source, and reputation, assigning a dynamic risk score. Based on this intelligence, LayerX enables real-time adaptive enforcement policies such as blocking high-risk extensions, allowing only approved ones, and generating alerts for suspicious activity or changes. By operating directly within the browser, LayerX provides deep visibility and fine-grained control, making it a critical line of defense against increasingly sophisticated browser extension-based attacks. How does LayerX secure enterprise use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT? Most users consume GenAI tools via the browser, making the web browser the main point of control for AI security. Traditional DLP and network-based solutions are complex to deploy, don’t provide real-time visibility, and lack control over most GenAI apps, allowing users to bypass them.  LayerX, deployed directly as a browser extension, offers comprehensive visibility and control over all AI applications and extensions, effectively addressing GenAI data security and ‘shadow’ AI challenges by enforcing last-mile AI security guardrails to stop users from sharing sensitive data with GenAI tools. How does LayerX protect against credential theft? LayerX can prevent web-based attempts to steal user credentials. It scans for phishing sites, prevents credential leakage to suspicious apps, and blocks risky browser extensions that may harvest user credentials. In addition, LayerX can modify, restrict, or block the storage of credentials on the hosting device in order to address device threats, such as malware attempting to steal the browser password data. Why isn’t my firewall enough to prevent employees from accessing malicious web pages? Traditional firewalls operate at the network layer and lack visibility into the dynamic, encrypted content users interact with inside modern browsers. Many malicious web pages are hosted on legitimate domains, use HTTPS encryption, or are delivered through compromised SaaS platforms—making them difficult for firewalls to detect or block. Firewalls also can’t identify in-browser threats like phishing pages, malicious redirects, or credential theft attempts. As work moves to the browser and employees access SaaS apps from any device or location, browser-native threats bypass perimeter defenses. A browser security platform like LayerX is needed to detect and block malicious activity at the point of interaction—in the browser itself—where firewalls fall short. Why do I need a browser security solution for my SaaS applications that are already protected by my SSE solution? While SSE platforms protect access to approved SaaS applications, they operate primarily at the network and proxy layers leaving them blind to in-browser activity. They can’t detect user actions like copy/paste, Shadow SaaS usage, DOM manipulation, or malicious browser extension behavior, where most SaaS data leaks now occur. Furthermore, SSEs rely on limited API integrations, which only work with a small set of mainstream SaaS platforms and lack visibility into emerging tools like GenAI apps or unsanctioned SaaS apps. These gaps are especially pronounced on unmanaged or BYOD devices, where SSE tools often have limited reach. A browser security solution like LayerX fills these gaps by operating directly within the browser—monitoring and securing real-time user activity across all apps, devices, and sessions without disrupting performance or workflows. It delivers granular control where SSE stops: at the browser layer, ensuring true Zero Trust enforcement in the last mile of the SaaS interaction. Doesn’t continuous monitoring of all user activity on the web violate the user’s privacy? Not at all! Continuous monitoring refers to the action that takes place locally within LayerX’s in-browser ML engine and not to the data sent to LayerX’s management console. This engine has granular visibility into every browsing event to ensure it can detect indications of malicious activity effectively and in a timely manner. However, the vast majority of this data, including Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and private content, never leaves the browser at all. The only data that is sent to the LayerX cloud is alerts on risky activities for the security team to investigate and respond to. How does LayerX work? LayerX operates as a lightweight browser-agnostic extension that transforms any standard browser—like Chrome or Edge—into a secure enterprise workspace. It monitors and analyzes browser activity in real time to detect risks such as data exfiltration, Shadow SaaS use, malicious extensions, and unsafe interactions with GenAI tools. LayerX enforces granular, session-aware security policies based on user identity, device posture, app sensitivity, and activity context. As it doesn’t route traffic through proxies or requires a separate browser, it makes deployment fast and frictionless. By integrating with identity management tools and zero trust access systems, LayerX minimizes overhead for security teams and enhances security capabilities to close critical gaps traditional solutions can’t see inside the browser. How is LayerX deployed in a production environment? LayerX is deployed as a lightweight, browser-native extension on existing browsers like Chrome and Edge, making rollout fast, frictionless, and scalable across any environment. For managed devices, LayerX is easily installed in a few clicks with device management tools (such as Group Policy, MDM, etc). For unmanaged devices, we provide identity-centric deployment that allows users to load a managed browser profile into their unmanaged device with a lightweight installer or a simple sign in. No proxy, agent, or traffic redirection is required, ensuring minimal disruption, low overhead, and immediate time to value. This allows users to access and interact with corporate cloud apps using a managed browser profile, without it ever monitoring any other device or personal browsing activity. The All-in-One AI & Browser Security Platform With LayerX, any organization can protect its identities, SaaS apps, data and devices from web-borne threats and browsing risks, while maintaining a top-notch user experience.
