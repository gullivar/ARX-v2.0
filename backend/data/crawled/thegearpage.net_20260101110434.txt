Jun 16 Jun 16, 2025 Tag 25,381 855 What he doesn't come out and say is that it works because the minor 3rd and natural 6th of the melodic minor up a half step from the dom7 chord are the 3rd and b7 of the 7th chord you are playing on. (The tritone)  it's why dorian lines a .5 step up work so well too. That's THE jazz minor sound. Continue… Laday Gaga. Damn. Apr 11 Apr 11, 2025 Tag 25,047 442 Chills all over.

For instance the John Lennon Rickenbackers being offered for around $300.00 implying some kind of US overstock. Then there's a lot of Dime guitars by Washburn and Dean, (sometimes mixing the two brands in the same ad), and Parker guitars all at this low price. Are these actually legitimate reissues from these companies and if so, who are running these companies? Then there are very humorous descriptions such as "floyed rosewood...

While everyone else was using Peavey Bandits, I had my Dads old '69 Fender Deluxe. I toured a few years, in the mid-90s, up until my daughter was born in 1999 and I've been a weekend warrior ever since. I used that Fender Deluxe up until about 2004, then I discovered Harmony Central, Dr. Z forum, the Boogie Board, then TGP... I realized how "wrong" I was for sticking to one amp, which has led me down a GAS filled path! I've been...

I will say, I am very pleased with the quality of the work. I’m glad this was resolved…I think a lot of it was due to this thread and community. To Dan’s credit, the communication and wait time were obviously atrocious, but he did offer an apology and didn’t charge me the balance of the estimate. Lay's Guitar Shop has had my 1950's Les Paul Special for the last 3.5 years...they won't return emails and I... Continue… The audition went well, you are hired IF you change guitar ... Mar 23 Mar 23, 2025 undulationist 15,391 343 So, you know and play the band repertoire well, everybody is impressed with your skills, the band is ready to hire you !! The only thing is your guitar "style" (I mean the instrument not your playing) is deemed a subpar fit with the band's purported persona or identity on stage. And so the band leader asks you to get a more "appropriate/suited" guitar... How do you react ? Do you comply, or do you say thanks, but no thanks , and walk away ? This is inspired by this article, in... Continue… Warmoth > Fender? Mar 20 Mar 20, 2025 sanrico 13,497 238 I've been a dyed-in-the-wool Fender guy ever since buying my first Telecaster 35 years ago, and have bought and sold more Fenders than I can remember. A good friend of mine has asked me to try Warmoth for years, telling me he liked the quality more than Fender. I always hesitated, though, because I couldn't play it first. I finally took the plunge into Warmoth with this "Tele," and am impressed. I love being able to choose every feature. This build sounds fantastic, has top-quality...

I saw one of the high-ish end strats (an Ultra?).  i think it was around $2200-2400.  I'm over Fender these days but it had an undeniably cool blue finish so i pulled it down to see what makes a non-CS strat cost nearly $2400. What i immediately discovered was that this thing had the nastiest fret sprout.  I mean, they were way outside the wood!  i put it back and then...

I recently discovered The Music Zoo's series of ZF "Zoo Floyd" Strats and Teles, the Tele version I never felt would make its way in to my collection but this one showed up used at my local shop at a very fair price so what the heck. Technically it's a Nocaster I guess, has a nice 51 thick neck. I have never played a Tele and was concerned that it might be too "country" sounding for my high gain needs but I plugged it in...

He’s an amazing player who doesn’t care about gear in the slightest. A $15 garage sale guitar or $4000 Taylor, it’s all the same to him - a wooden box with 6 strings on it. You ever know anybody like this?

At the time I really couldn't play much nor did I have a decent amp. Fast forward to Jan 2025 and I picked up a LP JR (6.7 lbs) and have been trying various P90s, even a humbucker that fits into the JRs cavity...and at present am using a Seymour Duncan JJN Silent P90 that I actually soldered in at midnight after a show, when I arrived home and it was sitting on my front porch. I've always... Continue… Here we are, a quarter through the 21st century, and changing pickups still requires a degree in electrical engineering. Mar 03 Mar 3, 2025 BrewDrinkRepeat 9,903 256 I exaggerate, of course, but I can't be the only one who finds it absurd that there is no standardized mounting system for pickups to make swapping them a five-minute job. Is there any legit, technical reason that I'm missing?
