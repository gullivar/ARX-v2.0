Download Sonarr Windows Linux macOS NAS Docker Others Package maintainers: Team Sonarr Introduction Sonarr is supported natively on Windows. Sonarr can be installed as Windows Service or System Tray Application. A Windows Service runs even when the user is not logged in, but special care must be taken since Windows Services cannot access network drives ( X:\ mapped drives or \\server\share UNC paths) without special configuration steps. Additionally the Windows Service runs under the Local Service account, by default this account does not have permissions to access your user's home directory unless permissions have been assigned manually. This is particularly relevant when using download clients that are configured to download to your home directory. It's therefore advisable to install Sonarr as a System Tray Application if the user can remain logged in. The option to do so is provided during the installer. Sonarr is supported on Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 or later. Pre-release or earlier versions of Windows are not supported. Updating Sonarr v3 to v4 Sonarr will automatically convert an existing Sonarr installation.
                                        It's advisable to make a backup of the v3 data first. 1 Install Sonarr Download the Windows Installer with the following link and execute it.

Updating Sonarr v3 to v4 Sonarr will convert an existing Sonarr database if found during startup. Of course, it is always advisable to make a backup first. 1 Download App package Download macOS App (ARM) Download macOS App (Intel) 2 Install App Open the archive and drag the Sonarr icon to your Application folder. In macOS 10.12+ Gatekeeper App Translocation will prevent Sonarr from updating if it's being run directly from the download location. Therefore it MUST be moved to the Application folder. 3 Self-sign Sonarr Open Terminal and run codesign --force --deep -s - /Applications/Sonarr.app && xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Sonarr.app 4 Start Sonarr Open Sonarr.app in your Application folder. 5 View Sonarr Browse to http://localhost:8989 to start using Sonarr.

A generic download is available for linux, but dependencies, installation and permissions will need to be done manually. Download Linux .tar.gz Package maintainers: linuxserver , hotio Introduction The Sonarr team does not offer an official Docker image. However, a number of third parties have created and maintain their own. These instructions provide generic guidance that should apply to any Sonarr Docker image. Updating Sonarr v3 to v4 Most docker containers use /config volume to mount the data directory and supply that path to Sonarr as parameter.
                                    Sonarr will convert the given directory on startup if an existing database is found. Of course, it is always advisable to make a backup first. 1 Avoid common pitfalls Volumes and Paths There are two common problems with Docker volumes: Paths that differ between the Sonarr and download client container and paths that prevent fast moves and hard links. The first is a problem because the download client will report a download's path as /torrents/My.Show.S01E01/ , but in the Sonarr container that might be at /downloads/My.Show.S01E01/ . The second is a performance issue and causes problems for seeding torrents. Both problems can be solved with well planned, consistent paths. Most Docker images suggest paths like /tv and /downloads . This causes slow moves and doesn't allow hard links because they are considered two different file systems inside the container. Some also recommend paths for the download client container that are different from the Sonarr container, like /torrents . The best solution is to use a single, common volume inside the containers,
                                    such as /data . Your Series would be in /data/tv , torrents in /data/downloads/torrents and/or usenet downloads in /data/downloads/usenet . If this advice is not followed, you may have to configure a Remote Path Mapping in the Sonarr web UI (Settings › Download Clients). Ownership and Permissions Permissions and ownership of files is one of the most common problems for Sonarr users, both inside and outside Docker. Most images have environment variables that can be used to override
                                    the default user, group and umask, you should decide this before setting up all of your containers.
                                    The recommendation is to use a common group for all related containers so that each container can use the shared group permissions to read and write files on the mounted volumes. Keep in mind that Sonarr will need read and write to the download folders as well as the final folders. For a more detailed explanation of these issues, see The Best Docker Setup and Docker Guide wiki article. 2 Install Sonarr To install and use these Docker images, you'll need to keep the above in mind while following their documentation. There are many ways to manage Docker images and containers too, so installation
                                    and maintenance of them will depend on the route you choose. ghcr.io/hotio/sonarr:release hotio doesn't specify any default volumes, besides /config . Images are automatically updated multiple times per hour if upstream changes are found.
                                                Read the instructions on how to install the image. ghcr.io/linuxserver/sonarr:latest linuxserver.io is one of the most prolific and popular Docker image maintainers. They also maintain images for most of the popular download clients as well.
                                                LinuxServer specifies a couple of optional default volumes such as /tv and /downloads . The default volumes are not optimal nor recommended. Our recommendation is to use a single volume for the data, as mentioned above. Please contact us if you wish to port Sonarr for any other platform than the ones already listed.
