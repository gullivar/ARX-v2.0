“Marketpay — concise, consolidated, and clever. Repeatable reporting helps to set an expectation for the internal client and provides a clear understanding of the market comparable to internal jobs.”

"[Payfactors’] analytical dashboards are game-changers for the way we work. They make us more likely to renew. I would want to keep it just to be able to pull data in real time without spending half a day prepping 18 Excel documents. Being able to go in, have our data ready, and see the fancy graphs is amazing. I would just say, keep doing what you're doing — we really love it."

“We initially looked at other vendors who could help us in this area, and we just didn’t find what we were looking for in terms of the level of partnership and expertise that Payscale could provide. It was important for us to make sure that the information we were receiving was reliable and to have it come from a trusted source. We can now confidently say we are looking at compensation in a way that will ensure that we’re building for the now as well as the future.”
