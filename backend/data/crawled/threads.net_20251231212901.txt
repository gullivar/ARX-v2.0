The most complex fiction prose I can think of is difficult to read because it has layers of obscure Biblical, historical, and other literary references most Americans are just not gonna be familiar with, period. Can I read that? Yes. Do I *want* to read that every day at 10 pm when my brain is a nice mushy soup? No
