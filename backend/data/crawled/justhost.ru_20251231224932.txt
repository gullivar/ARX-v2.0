VPS (Virtual Private Server) or VDS (Virtual Dedicated Server) is a virtual server that provides dedicated resources of a physical server, such as a processor, RAM, and disk space, for your use only. VPS works as a full-fledged server, giving you the freedom to install any software and perform tasks that require a specific configuration, ensuring high performance and stability of your project. A distinctive feature of VPS is the availability of dedicated server capacity at a lower price. How is VPS different from a dedicated server? The main difference between a VPS and a dedicated server is resource allocation. A VPS uses virtualization to share the resources of a physical server among multiple users. Each VPS runs in an independent environment, meaning you have a specific portion of the physical server's resources. This makes a VPS more affordable than a dedicated server. In contrast, a dedicated server is a physical server that is entirely at your disposal, giving you maximum flexibility and performance, but at a higher cost. What are the benefits of VPS from JustHost? JustHost provides VPS with high-speed SSD and NVMe drives for maximum performance and fast data access. 24/7 technical support is always ready to help resolve any issues. Our VPS servers are protected from DDoS attacks thanks to a built-in filtering system, which ensures the security of your project. Flexible tariff plans allow you to choose the optimal solution depending on your tasks and budget. The server is managed through a convenient control panel, which makes working with it as simple and intuitive as possible. How to choose the right tariff plan for VPS? When choosing a VPS tariff plan from JustHost, it is important to consider the specifics of your project. For simple websites or small applications, the basic plan with a minimum amount of resources is suitable. If your project requires high performance, for example, a large website with high traffic, an online store, or a database, then you should choose a tariff plan with more RAM, processing power and increased disk space. Our support team is ready to advise you so that you make the best choice to suit your business needs. Do you support data backup? No, we do not have automatic backup. But you can set up your own backup server and store copies on a separate server for increased reliability. How is protection against DDoS attacks organized? Our VPS have a built-in DDoS protection system that ensures the security and stable operation of your projects. The system filters malicious traffic, preventing attempts to overload the server with requests. This is important for protecting your resources from external threats that can negatively affect the availability of your services. We use a multi-layered approach to protection, which includes both traffic monitoring and mechanisms to prevent attacks at the stage of their occurrence. Do you provide assistance with data transfer? Yes, JustHost offers free assistance in migrating data from other hosting platforms. Our specialists will carry out all the necessary procedures for transferring files, databases, and server settings so that your website or application starts working on a new server without downtime and data loss.

Is it possible to change the VPS configuration after purchase? Yes, JustHost offers the flexibility to change your VPS configuration at any time. This is especially useful if your project starts to require more resources. You can add more processor cores, more RAM, or more disk space without having to move your data to another server.
