Prompt Database Frequently asked questions If you can’t find what you’re looking for, email our support team and if you’re lucky someone will get back to you. What is Stable Diffusion? Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model used for converting text to images. It can generate high-quality, photo-realistic images that look like real photographs by simply inputting any text. The latest version of this model is Stable Diffusion XL, which has a larger UNet backbone network and can generate even higher quality images. You can use the free AI image generator on Stable Diffusion Online or search over 9 million Stable Diffusion prompts on Prompt Database. What is the difference between Stable Diffusion and other AI image generators? Stable Diffusion is unique in that it can generate high-quality images with a high degree of control over the output. It can produce output using various descriptive text inputs like style, frame, or presets. In addition to creating images, SD can add or replace parts of images thanks to inpainting and extending the size of an image, called outpainting. What was the Stable Diffusion model trained on? The underlying dataset for Stable Diffusion was the 2b English language label subset of LAION 5b https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/, a general crawl of the internet created by the German charity LAION. What is the copyright for using Stable Diffusion generated images? The area of AI-generated images and copyright is complex and will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Can artists opt-in or opt-out to include their work in the training data? There was no opt-in or opt-out for the LAION 5b model data. It is intended to be a general representation of the language-image connection of the Internet. What kinds of GPUs will be able to run Stable Diffusion, and at what settings? Most NVidia and AMD GPUs with 8GB or more. How does Stable Diffusion work? Instead of operating in the high-dimensional image space, Stable Diffusion first compresses the image into the latent space. The model then gradually destroys the image by adding noise, and is trained to reverse this process and regenerate the image from scratch. What are some tips for creating effective prompts for Stable Diffusion? To create effective prompts for Stable Diffusion, it’s important to provide a clear and concise description of the image you want to generate. You should also use descriptive language that is specific to the type of image you want to generate. For example, if you want to generate an image of a sunset, you might use words like "orange", "red", and "purple" to describe the colors in the image. Which model are you using? We are using the Stable Diffusion XL model, which is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input. Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone: The increase of model parameters is mainly due to more attention blocks and a larger cross-attention context as SDXL uses a second text encoder. What is the copyright on images created through Stable Diffusion Online? Images created through Stable Diffusion Online are fully open source, explicitly falling under the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication. What is the difference between SDXL Turbo and SDXL 1.0? SDXL Turbo (Stable Diffusion XL Turbo) is an improved version of SDXL 1.0 (Stable Diffusion XL 1.0), which was the first text-to-image model based on diffusion models. SDXL Turbo implements a new distillation technique called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), which enables the model to synthesize images in a single step and generate real-time text-to-image outputs while maintaining high sampling fidelity. Can I use Stable Diffusion for commercial purposes? Yes, you can use Stable Diffusion for commercial purposes. Stable Diffusion model has been released under a permissive license that allows users to generate images for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. How can I use Stable Diffusion to generate images? There are primarily two ways that you can use Stable Diffusion to create AI images, either through an API on your local machine or through an online software program like https://stablediffusionweb.com. If you plan to install Stable Diffusion locally, you need a computer with beefy specs to generate images quickly. What are Diffusion Models? Generative models are a class of AI machine learning models that can generate new data based on training data. Can we expect more features? Absolutely. We are working on that.
