Donate to Godot!

This has been a great year for the engine, but there are still a lot of things we would love to do.
If everyone visiting the site would donate €5, we could hire 5 more developers to work on Godot full-time.

A different way to make games
Innovative design

Godot's Node and Scene system gives you both power and flexibility to create anything.

Use the right language for the job

Keep your code modular with an object-oriented API using Godot's own GDScript, C#, C++, or bring your own using GDExtension.

C# support is currently only available for desktop and mobile platforms as of Godot 4.2.
Use Godot 3 to run C# on the Web platform.
Dedicated 2D engine

Make crisp and performant 2D games with Godot's dedicated 2D rendering engine with real 2D pixel coordinates and 2D nodes.

Simple and powerful 3D

Godot's 3D nodes give you everything you need to build, animate, and render your 3D worlds and characters.

Release on all platforms

Deploy your game on desktop, mobile, and the web in seconds. Godot even supports consoles through third party publishers.

Open Source

Truly open development: anyone who contributes to Godot benefits equally from others’ contributions.
