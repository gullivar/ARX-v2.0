Go-to platform for students and freshers
I landed my first internship from Internshala! This app has opportunities for every student and is a must-have for students looking to build their careers.
Yogesh Singh
Placed in Flipkart
Got my dream job at Amazon!
I applied to Amazon and got the job! It was my dream. I wanted to get into tech but I was from an electrical background. I learned the skills, which came in handy in my interviews. Thanks to Internshala, I was able to explain the concepts and applications well. They helped me with everything.
Yaswanth Mandapati

Turning doubts into success
I had no idea how to enter the corporate world, what kind of job would be a good fit for me, or where to even start. Internshala guided me through the entire process, helping me build the right skills and confidence. Thanks to their support and resources, I was able to secure an internship, which eventually led to a job offer from Flipkart.

Got an internship at Flipkart
After facing disappointments from campus placement rejections, I turned to Internshala. I learned valuable skills, how to crack interviews, and how to make a strong resume through their guidance. A few months later, I secured a data science internship with Flipkart. It's my first job after graduation. The office is huge, and I love it here!
