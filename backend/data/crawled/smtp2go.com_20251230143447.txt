Proudly serving companies like
Deloitte Fast500 5 years in a row
SMTP2GO means rock solid reliability.

An outgoing email service needs to be carefully set up and properly maintained to be capable of performing.

No more downtime

Our redundant, multi data center
infrastructure means emails
will still be sent even during
a major internet outage.

Get alerted about problems

Find out immediately if a potential problem exists with your account, such as a sudden increase in your bounce rate.

Avoid arbitrary throttling

Avoid the low hourly or daily limits put in place by ISP or webhost SMTP services, which are often only run as an afterthought.

See what happens to the emails you send.

Get a visual on all of your sent emails, spam complaints, bounced emails, unsubscribe requests, and more.

Visual Reports

Understand what is actually happening to every email sent from your infrastructure.

Deep Insights

Track emails right to the final destination, just like tracking a parcel in the mail.

Robust Testing

Test your emails against major spam filters and see how they’ll appear in all major email software.

SMTP2GO takes care of the technical aspects of email delivery.

Email technology and standards are constantly evolving. You shouldn't need to stay on top of them.

Stay Off Blacklists

We stay a step ahead of blacklists by preventing the cause of problems before they happen.

Stay Out of Spam Folders

SPF and DKIM are handled automatically for your domain names, no prior knowledge required.

Send Any Kind of Email

SMTP2GO has been a lifesaver for me. It serves a category that, frankly, I never even knew existed before I started using it.

As a database developer, SMTP2GO has enabled me to integrate everyday mailing as well as database marketing emails directly into my solutions. It helps me create a completely frictionless experience for my users. On the backend, the reports and easily downloaded result data is well organized and easy to incorporate with my solutions. It's become an invaluable tool for me and my clients.

We've used SMTP2GO for several years now for executing a substantial number of emails on a regular basis. The service has been reliable and the support outstanding.

We are always updated if our account nears our quota and the delivery reports and enhanced features are great.

SMTP2GO achieves its core functionality. Their servers stay up, email is delivered, and the reporting and analytical tools help you troubleshoot any deliver issues. Their API is comprehensive, and their development has willingly expanded it upon request.

What really sets SMTP2GO apart is their customer service. Any time I've had a technical issue, the support team responds quickly with actionable information. I'm not referred to a KB article I've already read, and I'm given all the relevant details and helpful directions that solve the problem.

When we've inadvertently run into compliance issues, SMTP2GO was understanding and helped us meet their terms and conditions. They easily could've cancelled our account, but instead they worked to educate us and resolve the problem. In doing so, SMTP2GO made us a life-long customer.

I cannot recommend SMTP2GO enough. They offer a solution to a specific problem and do so with professionalism, reliability, and expertise.
