Just like free online movie streaming sites, anime watching sites are not created equally, some are better than the rest, so we've decided to build HiAnime.to to be one of the best free anime streaming site for all anime fans on the world.

3/ So what make HiAnime.to the best site to watch anime free online?

Before building HiAnime.to, we've checked many other free anime sites, and learnt from them. We only keep the good things and remove all the bad things from all the competitors, to put it in our HiAnime website. Let's see how we're so confident about being the best site for anime streaming:

Safety: We try our best to not having harmful ads on HiAnime.
Content library: Our main focus is anime. You can find here popular, classic, as well as current titles from all genres such as action, drama, kids, fantasy, horror, mystery, police, romance, school, comedy, music, game and many more. All these titles come with English subtitles or are dubbed in many languages.
Quality/Resolution: All titles are in excellent resolution, the best quality possible. HiAnime.to also has a quality setting function to make sure our users can enjoy streaming no matter how fast your Internet speed is. You can stream the anime at 360p if your Internet is being ridiculous, Or if it is good, you can go with 720p or even 1080p anime.
Streaming experience: Compared to other anime streaming sites, the loading speed at HiAnime.to is faster. Downloading is just as easy as streaming, you won't have any problem saving the videos to watch offline later.

If you want to watch a specific title, search for it via the search box. If you want to look for suggestions, you can use the site's categories or simply scroll down for new releases.
Device compatibility: HiAnime works alright on both your mobile and desktop. However, we'd recommend you use your desktop for a smoother streaming experience.

Can you mentally become japanese?
Hello, Im 34M (though tomorrow is my birthday) and I constantly watch anime, I've picked up a few words here and there but after watching so much I've often felt a connection, or a "True Calling" if you will to the beautiful nation of Japan. Now recently, ive felt myself slipping into a japanese identity, when I go to call someone an idiot... The japanese word for that: "Baka" happens to slip out instead. Instead of Hello: the phone greeting "Moshi Moshi" slips out also. Now the reason I ask this is, do you think its possible to mentally become japanese?

One piece is going to finish one day
One piece is gonna finish one day. We are gonna know what one piece is. Then people start watching knowing end of the story. Where's the fun in that? Where's the joy of adventure? Really su,cks for those people tbh I am lucky to watch this masterpiece live.
