NVMe Storage Free SSL Certificate CloudLinux HostPapa uses NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) for data storage. Simply put, this means a much faster loading speed for your website hosting. If your server can display your website at lightning speed, this will contribute to the user experience on your site. This includes more time spent on the site, more interaction, more pages visited—eventually helping you achieve your website’s goals, whether that’s selling your product, sharing your expertise, or other objectives. SSL certificates are an absolute must if you want your website to be considered safe. Google is merciless to websites that don’t have an SSL. Not only will this affect your website’s search rankings, but eventually, it won’t even be accessible from search engine results. SSL certificates encrypt the data exchange between your website and the visitor’s browser, making it difficult for hackers to access this data. This is especially important if you store your customers’ credit card information. For a complete website hosting experience, HostPapa provides you with an SSL Certificate Free of charge! CloudLinux helps protect websites in a shared website hosting environment. Suppose one of the websites on the server gets attacked or experiences a sudden spike in unexpected traffic. In that case, it could drain the server’s resources, affecting other websites. CloudLinux makes sure this doesn’t happen. It will either slow down the website to keep it from hogging all available resources or temporarily shut it down. HostPapa aims to ensure your customers can browse your website without issues. So, if one website encounters a problem, it will not affect any other websites on the same server while it’s being resolved. Why choose HostPapa for your web hosting? Reliable Servers & Technology We only invest in top-tier technology and servers to ensure your website’s optimal performance. Enhanced for Speed & Performance You can count on our technology to help you achieve blazing-fast page load speeds.
