OVERVIEW
COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT

United Online's Communications segment features the reliable, value-priced Internet access brands NetZero (www.netzero.com) and Juno (www.juno.com). Both brands offer a variety of plans, and customers can choose the option that best meets their connection needs.

NetZero and Juno pioneered the value-priced Internet access category in 2001, and both brands offer a full range of high quality, low priced dial-up and DSL Internet access services.

NetZero and Juno each offer four types of nationwide dial-up service. The Free service provides 10 hours of access each month free of charge and includes NetZero email. The Basic service provides unlimited access along with email and spam protection. Customers who purchase the Accelerated Dial-Up service (either NetZero HiSpeed or Juno Turbo) can surf the Web at up to 5 times the speed of standard dial-up. The Toll-free service allows customers who live in hard to serve areas to connect to the Internet using a toll-free 800 access number.

DSL service from NetZero and Juno is available in select cities and delivers broadband Internet directly to the home. DSL customers also receive Norton Antivirus online, MegaMail with built-in spam and email virus protection.

The Communications segment also offers email, and web hosting services. Its NetZero DataShield WiFi security service encrypts and protects users' data when they connect to the Internet via WiFi connections, including public WiFi hubs.
