I’ve had EarthLink for a few years. Like everything out there I had a couple of issues but it was corrected. I love the fact that the prices are great!! Talking to my sister who is a consumer and that was all I needed. Compared to all of the companies to me this is the best.

My installer called ahead, and arrived on time. He was very knowledgeable and efficient with his installation and after, he helped us with our re-connects and such. I was very pleased and satisfied after the installation. The person burying the cable in the yard also did a great job. Can barely tell where it was.

I remain apprehensive as I don't trust any company. They recently offered a free upgrade to gigabyte over my 75mbps plan. I called and said I'd rather have lower price as 75 is plenty for what I do. I clicked the offer online and was offered a few options for the upgrade time, I chose "in the next 2 weeks" as I said the speed tier I was on was fine. It was scheduled for the afternoon of a wed, the...  See More

Transition from ATT ISP to Earthlink was relatively transparent and painless. The ATT rep who installed my Earthlink service deserves a raise. The only issue is me forgetting about devices I had connected to wifi, until I had to use them. Then adding them was a pain in the neck as it would be with any new ISP.

Wade was on time, friendly and efficient in the job, took his time to make sure everything was working correctly before he left, advised of other speeds we might want to consider and to call if had any issues.

I was unexpectedly offered a better service upgrade for the same price. The technician was very polite, professional, knowledgeable and went above and beyond to make sure everything went well; especially the clarity of the signal.

I recently changed from Spectrum and enjoyed saving money for better quality. I transitioned from cable television to internet based programming and now rely on internet. I hope this service continues to improve.

Our experience getting new fiber service was so easy! Ariel was so kind, prompt and very detailed to make sure all was set up and working before he finished. Quick and very well done and we are so grateful!

Great Internet service! They have always answered when I needed their help. Great customer service and technicians. It is a very reliable internet service. It has been down a few times but they usually have it up and running within a couple weeks or sooner.

Upon arrival, the technician was very courteous, but went straight to work without delay! He was very informative and thorough throughout the installation process. The technician also explained how to monitor my wi-fi connection via app.

We switched from Spectrum. We have a much better connection with EarthLink than Spectrum. Our speed is much faster for the price. EarthLink does disconnect while streaming movies. Spectrum was charging $92 per month for 2 people, we were only getting 75Mbps. We don't play games. We mostly stream movies. EarthLink cost less and is a faster speed, 300 Mbps. The technician was great!

I have had a very favorable experience with EarthLink. The initial customer service discussions for the type of service based on my internet needs, to installation, were pleasant and informative, as was the physical installation process. I would recommend EarthLink to anyone who would like reliable, inexpensive, and fast streaming internet service.

From the time I called and up through and including the installation process, I was treated with respect and spoke to like a friend. Suggestions were discussed with me, and potential issues were explained before they happened. It was a very good experience and the service works great.

Small house, great service. SpeedTest blows previous service completely out of the water! Added bonus - with old system I had to buy 2.4Ghz router for my Wyze security cams. Don't need it anymore - Eero does that speed too, and images look even better! Set up guest login using the same name and password my visiting family already has from previous system.
