🤔 WebDevCody @ webdevcody @convex Simple. Fast. Realtime. AndyOz @ andy_austin_dev I think @convex might be the best DB I've ever used Robin @ robinxpfp Happy to see more first-class clerk x convex integration

There's such a major architecture shift around Serverless + Edge + React + Typescript that (imo) it's unlikely sql is still the right abstraction

Very compelling that convex is approaching this from first principles Colin | Clerk.com @ tweetsbycolin 😱 @convex is the gift that keeps on giving

Check it out in combination with @nextjs docs.convex.dev Guillermo Rauch @ rauchg @convex is everything I wanted Firebase to be. Such a great tool. Feels illegal to know about this before others. Timothy Stepro @ tim_stepro #dailytip if you are a #react developer and want an alternative to Firebase, you might want to give @convex a try. It has amazing ReactHooks with samples in #Javascript and #typescript and the price isn't bad. I'm not a Firebase expert but it looks like all features are there urubatan @ urubatan @convex feels like what I wanted Firebase and MongoDB Realm to be and more. Really enjoying the DX so far! David Kim @ dvddkkim I used @convex once to make sure our integration at @ClerkDev worked and the docs matched what we expected.

It's magical. I don't say that lightly. I think it's time to do a video on the channel. James Perkins @ james_r_perkins I'm working on a new app build with @convex and I am *very* excited about the tech here

I made a realtime application using @convex, @nextjs, and @auth0 and loved it.😍 Anshuman Bhardwaj @ sun_anshuman Interesting tool of the week: convex.dev by @convex
