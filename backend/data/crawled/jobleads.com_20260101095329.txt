We don’t place people into positions, and we don’t manage payments between employers and the people they hire.

We’re the platform that’s on your side throughout your entire job search journey. How much does JobLeads cost? That depends on how quickly you land your next role—and with our tools, it might be sooner than you think. You can try JobLeads for 14 days for the price of a coffee. If you need us longer, our Premium membership is priced per four-week period. The real question isn’t what it costs—it’s what staying stuck in the wrong job costs you. We’re here to help you take control and move forward, whether that takes weeks or months. Can I cancel my JobLeads subscription at any time? Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time.

What is the value of working with headhunters and how does JobLeads connect me to them? Most jobs from headhunters—especially senior and specialist roles—are never publicly advertised. Headhunters hold the keys to this hidden job market, often with higher-paying positions and faster hiring processes.

Our AI-matching technology analyzes your search preferences to connect you with the most relevant headhunters in your field. No cold emails. No guesswork. Just the right introductions to people who can change your career for good. Where does JobLeads get its job postings from?
