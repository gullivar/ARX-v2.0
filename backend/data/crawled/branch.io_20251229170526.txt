From our customers

A lot of the value that Branch offers for us comes back to connectivity — understanding where our customers are and how we’re adding value. What sets Branch apart are the people we work with. They understand our challenges and goals, and not only partner with us with what we need from them but come to the table with ideas and strategies for us to take forward. The folks care about what we’re trying to accomplish and deeply understand the nuances of our business.

Daniel Joseph

Vice President, Global Product Management, DTC, Warner Bros Discovery

Branch has essentially made our lives easier. The team, company, and people we interact with on a day to day basis have continued to be incredibly solution-oriented, helpful, productive partners for us. Branch’s greatest superpower is approaching everything they do from a care and a passion around the mobile experiences and mobile ecosystems. They look holistically at the space and that’s served them well in building trust and an understanding.

Andrew Touchstone

Senior Director, Growth Marketing, Credit Karma

Branch has helped us expand our potential in engaging with our customers and focus on the importance of creating a cohesive journey across our mobile and app platforms. The support we have also seen from the Branch team is a true testament to a long-lasting partnership.

Razan Snobar

Gianna Spyroulia

Digital Marketing, Philips

Branch is at the forefront of how we get a user into our app — and our growth would not be nearly what it is today without Branch. Beyond the ease of implementation, we’ve found true partners on the Branch team that work as hard as we do to make sure we’re achieving goals.
