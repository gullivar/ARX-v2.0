Cathedral of San Cataldo
A Baroque masterpiece dedicated to the patron saint It is the oldest in Puglia. The Cathedral of San Cataldo in Taranto was originally dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, but was later dedicated to Saint Catald, Bishop, the city's patron saint. There was apparently an original structure from the 5th century AD, but the present-day cathedral was built by the Byzantines in the 10th century at the behest of Emperor Nicephorus II Phoca. It underwent various structural and aesthetic changes up to the 11th century, and the last works date back to 1713, when the architect Mauro Manieri from Lecce made it a Baroque masterpiece, with medallions and niches with saints and angels that can still be seen today. In the interior, with a wealth of polychrome inlaid marble and stucco, is the Chapel of San Cataldo, which preserves patron's mortal remains, rediscovered in the Baptistery in 1071. Artworks worthy of note include the statues of the Assumption and of Saint Catald, and the medieval floor mosaic, rediscovered in 1844 and attributed to a certain Petroius, from between 1163 and 1165. The crypt also contains frescoes dating from the 14th and 15th centuries.

Turin and Its Chocolate Tradition
The continuing love story between Turin and chocolate began as far back as 1560: in celebration of the Ducal Capital’s move from Chambéry to Turin, Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy served a symbolic cup of piping hot chocolate to the city. An authentic passion that has created specialties now known throughout the world has also continued to stimulate the imaginations of the master chocolatiers over the centuries. Indeed, it was here in the Savoy Capital that the Bicerin – a glass of hot coffee, cacao, and milk cream – was conceived in the 1700s. By way of chocolate, the maestros of Turin knew exactly how to express their taste for innovation, so much so that they experimented with new mechanisms to mix cacao, vanilla, water and sugar into a malleable paste (beginning 17th Century). They discovered that they could transform the chocolate into solid bars, thus giving life to chocolates, or cioccolatini, of every type – from bon bons to pralines, truffles and cremini.

Italian cuisine, a UNESCO Heritage: taste the most authentic Italy
Officially recognized as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, Italian cuisine represents one of the most authentic and profound elements of the national identity. It is a heritage made not only of recipes, but also of ancient knowledge, conviviality, and traditions passed down from generation to generation. Every region, every city, and even every family preserves its own interpretation of dishes, contributing to a gastronomic mosaic that tells the story of Italy through its flavors and aromas. The true strength of Italian cuisine lies precisely in its extraordinary territorial diversity, the result of the encounter between distinct landscapes, millennia-old cultures, and unique biodiversity.
