Streamlining Team Documentation
I've been thinking about how our team can streamline the onboarding process for new-hires. Right now, documentation is scattered across different tools, which makes it hard to find answers quickly. If we consolidate into a single hub and add more real-world examples, I think it'll cut down on repetative questions and help people ramp up faster.
