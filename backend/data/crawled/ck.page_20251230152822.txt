LANDING PAGES

Fast to launch

Kit landing pages are easy to create so you see results fast. Choose from templates designed by pros to turn traffic into subscribers, add your branding and content, and then easily generate a custom link so you can start sharing right away.

No code necessary

You can have a beautiful landing page without knowing any code. But if code is your thing, there’s also a CSS option.

Access to 100,000+ free images

With Kit’s Unsplash integration, you can find and choose unique imagery directly in our landing page builder, making it easy to design a beautiful landing page with just a few clicks.

Your business should look good on all devices

All our templates are fully responsive so you’ll have a perfectly formatted landing page that can easily be viewed on any device.

Some of the templates that I’ve used for my landing pages are converting at an 80%+ rate, which is far higher than I had with other templates.

Turn browsers into buyers

When your people fill out the opt-in form on your landing page, they are giving you permission to enter their world and their inbox. Not everyone is ready to buy at first glance, but delivering value via email is what turns new fans into loyal customers.

Kit forms help you collect email addresses from people who are interested in what you offer, so you can nurture leads through thoughtful follow-ups and guide them toward a purchase when they're ready.

Delivering a lead magnet

The best way to grow your email list is to give potential subscribers something valuable in return.

Landing pages help you deliver free content downloads or links automatically and instantly. Your reader gets valuable content and your list grows with subscribers truly hungry for the value you provide.

Preview this landing page

The Kit landing page platform is so easy to use and attracts my readers due to the simplicity and minimal designs. I am more capable of targeting my exact audience and they receive smooth access to their free downloads and to me!

Insights to grow your list faster each time

The data shows you how your audience interacts with your landing page so you can improve your conversions and keep creating better and better pages to grow your list faster each time.

Advanced tracking

For more advanced tracking options, simply add your Google Analytics, Segment, and/or Facebook business IDs to connect powerful analytics to your Kit landing page builder.
