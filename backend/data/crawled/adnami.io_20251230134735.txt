Sonar - Measure what matters

Sonar is Adnami’s predictive attention measurement technology. Whether your ads are created with Adnami or not – Sonar measures impressions, interactivity, viewability, time in view and core attention metrics. Sonar enables auto-tagging and automated data exports and is also compatible with major DSPs.
