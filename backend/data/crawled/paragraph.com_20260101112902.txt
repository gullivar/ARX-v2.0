This is my story of navigating the highs, lows, and the chaos in between. And the hard-earned lessons that I wish I had learnt sooner. What Happened In 2025 AVC Dec 31 I like to bookend the New Year holiday with two posts, one looking back at the year that is ending (What Happened) and one looking forward to the year ahead (What Will Happen). This is the first of these two posts. The second one will run tomorrow. Here's a top ten list of things that happened this year that really matter. 1/ The end of globalization.

Every year I dedicate the last article of the year to reflect on the year gone by. Seeing as this article goes to print on the very last day of 2025, I thought I'd take the opportunity to look ahead instead — and try and predict what the next 25 years will bring. BuildBetter by BFG Dec 31 BuildBetter 2025 Wrapped Looking back, most of what I wrote this year was about orientation of your thinking towards things that matter the most when you're building products, teams and businesses. It was also a bit about how to look at work, markets, technology, and life without constantly reacting to noise. This is my wrap for 2025... Brandon Donnelly Dec 31 The in-between space I'm a big fan of the period between Christmas and when most of the world gets back to work in the New Year. It's the only time of year that I know of where the email firehose shuts off, the social permission to do "nothing" turns on, and the world generally quiets down. I know that not everyone gets this time off. We all have different jobs. Earlier in my career, I used to always work these days between Christmas and the New Year because I couldn't spare the vacation days. But if you are fort...

Mixed Realities with TJ Kawamura Dec 31 2026: What Becomes Scarce Every cycle feels noisy while you’re living through it. The signal only becomes obvious later. The biggest shifts ahead aren’t about more AI, more crypto, or more software. They’re about where intelligence moves, how value flows, and what becomes scarce again. 2025 was the year of abundance. AI gave everyone the ability to create more than ever before. More content. More software. More ideas. Much of it generic. Output exploded faster than judgment. 2026 is the correction. Scarcity returns, n... Sharing is Caring Dec 30 So, What Do You Actually Do? A question I get a lot from friends is some version of: “What do you actually do?” When I try to answer, I usually reach for an imperfect analogy: governance work in crypto is closest to a board of directors — except it’s decentralized, transparent, and governing an open-source, permissionless protocol rather than a single company. That difference matters a lot. In most crypto ecosystems, there are three distinct stakeholder groups that coexist in tension:the Corporation or Labs entity that o... Beyond Blocks and Bits Dec 30 Year in Review 2025: Crypto Enters Adulthood From adolescence to adulthood, 2025 marked the year blockchain crossed from fringe to core financial infrastructure. Seventeen years after Bitcoin's release, the industry has found product-market fit and come of age: stablecoins and tokenization are rewiring legacy finance with institutions bridging liquidity to onchain capital markets. As institutions continue to “tokenize everything” the distinction between onchain and off-chain asset classes are dissolving. The total value of tokenized rea...
