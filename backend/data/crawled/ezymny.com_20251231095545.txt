Hidden trackers lurk on 85% of popular websites. We actively block them by default, helping you evade hackers, scammers, and data-hungry companies.

Goodbye Incognito mode, hello real privacy in every tab
Block 3rd-party trackers from Google, Facebook, and others
Delete all tabs, history, and browsing data in one click
Block most ads & cookie pop-ups for fewer interruptions.

Our tracker blocking stops most ads before they even appear, letting you enjoy your favorite content with less hassle. We spot cookie pop-ups right away and, where possible, opt you out automatically, so you won’t even see them.

Stop ads following you everywhere
Block annoying cookie pop-ups
Watch YouTube videos without targeted ads
Data protection, not data collection.

We believe the best way to protect your data is to stop it from being collected at all. We never track your searches, and our browsing protections help stop other companies from collecting your data.
