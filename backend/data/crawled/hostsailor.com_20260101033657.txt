Purchasing an SSL certificate (Secure Sockets Layer) is the first step to protecting your website and your visitors’ trust. An SSL certificate encrypts data transferred between your site and its server, ensuring that sensitive information such as personal details, passwords, and payment data remains secure. It also boosts your site’s credibility and improves search rankings by signaling safety to users and browsers alike. With HostSailor, you can safeguard your online presence and give every visitor the confidence to browse, interact, and transact securely.
