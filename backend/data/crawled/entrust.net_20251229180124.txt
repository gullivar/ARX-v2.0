My organization selected Entrust because we had some use cases that our previous solutions did not cover. We had a combination of legacy solutions that were not updated appropriately. That triggered a search for a holistic tool around security solutions. We evaluated several vendors, and looking at the end-to-end offerings, along with how well it integrated with our current ecosystem, we selected Entrust.
