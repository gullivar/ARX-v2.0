FAQs
Can I Use Azar for Free?

Azar lets you access a variety of fun features for free, but customizing who you meet by gender and region filter is available through our Gems on our website.  Don’t miss out on bonus benefits available only on the web.

What Makes Azar Stand Out as a Video Chat App?

Azar makes meeting new people feel real and exciting with face-to-face video chats that happen in the moment. It’s not just messages or profiles — it’s real conversations, in real time.
Plus, with safety features and moderation tools, you can focus on having fun while we help keep a more respectful and safer community.

Is Azar a random video chat?

Azar isn’t just a random video chat - the more you use Azar the more our recommendation algorithm learns the type of persons you enjoyed chatting with and matches you with similar people.

What kind of safety tools does Azar offer?

If something feels off during a chat, Azar’s ‘MatchBlur’ feature automatically blurs the other person’s screen. You can report anyone with just a tap — we’ll capture the key video and audio so you don’t have to explain everything. If something makes you uncomfortable, hit that report button — we’ve got your back.
