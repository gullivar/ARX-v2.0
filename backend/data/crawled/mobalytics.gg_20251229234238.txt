I was Silver IV when I started using Mobalytics, now I’m Platinum IV. I really like using the GPI to see where I can improve.
Poder
I'm loving Mobalytics it has helped me identify my flaws and made me more balanced as a jungler. My objective control and ganking have improved significantly as well as my overall map awareness allowing me to be more responsive to enemy ganks.
Hikamatsu
Mobalytics GPI was able to tell me that in over 110 duels with Irelia, I have over a 57% win rate. No other site out there can do this.
TF Blade
I actually think people are sleeping on Mobalytics. It just beats out OP.GG in my opinion. If you’re actively looking to improve give it a go.
