heic2508 — Science Release
Hubble casts doubt on certainty of galactic collision
Over a decade’s worth of NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope data was used to re-examine the long-held prediction that the Milky Way galaxy will collide with the Andromeda galaxy in about 4.5 billion years. The astronomers found that, based on the latest observational data from Hubble as well as the Gaia space telescope, there is only a 50-50 chance of the two galaxies colliding within the next 10 billion years. The study also found that the presence of the Large Magellanic Cloud can affect the trajectory of the Milky Way and make the collision less likely. The researchers emphasize that predicting the long-term future of galaxy interactions is highly uncertain, but the new findings challenge the previous consensus and suggest the fate of the Milky Way remains an open question.

Hubble sees asteroids colliding at nearby star for first time
In a historical milestone, catastrophic collisions in a nearby planetary system were witnessed for the first time by astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. As they observed the bright star Fomalhaut, the scientists saw the impact of massive objects around the star. The Fomalhaut system appears to be in a dynamical upheaval, similar to what our solar system experienced in its first few hundred million years after formation.

Hubble sees white dwarf eating piece of Pluto-like object
In our nearby stellar neighbourhood, a burned-out star is snacking on a fragment of a Pluto-like object. With its unique ultraviolet capability, only the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope could identify that this meal is taking place.

Hubble uncovers rare white dwarf merger remnant
An international team of astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have discovered a stellar rarity: an ultra-massive white dwarf that formed when a white dwarf merged with another star, rather than through the evolution of a single star. This discovery, which was made possible by Hubble’s sensitive ultraviolet observations, suggests that these rare white dwarfs may be more common than previously suspected.

Hubble makes size estimate of interstellar comet
A team of astronomers has taken the sharpest-ever picture of the unexpected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, using the crisp vision of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.
