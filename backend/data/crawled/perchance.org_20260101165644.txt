# Create a Random Generator
##  Welcome to Perchance! 
Perchance is a platform for creating and sharing random generators. To create a random generator you simply create lists which reference other lists:
```
output
  Your [pack] contains [item], [item] and [item].

item
  a few coins
  an old {silver|bronze} ring
  a handkerchief
  a shard of bone
  some lint
  a tin of tea leaves

pack
  purse
  backpack
  bag
  pack
  knapsack
  rucksack

```
[try this example](https://perchance.org/rg4m14ri#edit)
So, for example, whenever you write [pack], a random item from the "pack" list will be put in its place — as shown in [this animation](https://user.uploads.dev/file/bc63c883358b59575af1b8a142b90834.mp4) by [Vionet20](https://perchance.org/vionet20-gens).
[Here's a link](https://perchance.org/rg4m14ri#edit) to a minimal perchance generator based on the above code. You can edit it, save your own version, and share it.
You can change the odds of items like so:
```
pack
  purse
  backpack ^2
  bag
	...

```

That makes "backpack" twice as likely as the others to be chosen when we write [pack]. You can import other peoples' generators like this:
```
sentence
	I need a new {import:noun}.
	Quickly, {import:verb}!

```

You can also alter the capitalisation, pluralisation, tense, and other properties of your word lists. Here's how to play around with capitalisation, for example:
```
sentence
	[name.titleCase], can you hear me?
	HELLO, [name.upperCase]!

name
  patricia
	khalid
	anaya
	...

```

There are a bunch of different shorthand notations to make common tasks easier:
```
sentence
	{She|He} was about {15-20}0cm tall and was carrying {1-3} {import:concrete-noun}{s}.

```

If you prefer to learn via video, here's a great unofficial introduction video by YouTuber [Chaoclypse](https://www.youtube.com/@Chaoclypse) who is using Perchance to create RPG generators:
(btw, feel free to share your own Perchance video tutorials on [the community forum](https://lemmy.world/c/perchance) - you might get featured here!)
The above examples only show the **absolute basics** of Perchance! If you'd like to learn more, check out the [tutorial](https://perchance.org/tutorial), and start playing around with a [minimal example](https://perchance.org/minimal#edit) (or the [basic template](https://perchance.org/basic-template#edit)). Check out the [examples](https://perchance.org/examples) page and this [somewhat complexified version](https://perchance.org/aqr03wn1#edit) of the previous backpack example for some demonstration of advanced features.

Once you've created a generator, you can **share it** with others by simply sharing the URL. You can change the URL in the "settings" menu. You can also **download it** as a single HTML file so that you can run it offline, or even turn it into a [Twitter bot](https://perchance.org/create-a-twitter-bot) or a [Tumblr bot](https://perchance.org/create-a-tumblr-bot). It's also easy to **embed it** in your own website:
```
<iframe src="https://null.perchance.org/my-generator-name" style="width:100%; height:600px; border:none;"></iframe>

```

And a note to coders: It's also possible to [set up an API server](https://perchance.org/diy-perchance-api) for your generator, even though Perchance doesn't have an "official" API at this point. It's also possible to [set up a Discord bot](https://perchance.org/perchance-discord-bot) which will respond to messages with the output of a generator that you choose.
We have a [Lemmy community](https://lemmy.world/c/perchance) which you might like to join. Feel free to share your creations there or ask questions if you need some help building your generator. Also check out the work-in-progress [useful generators](https://perchance.org/useful-generators) list which might have some generators that you'd find useful for importing into your own generator.
If you're looking for a simple random generator maker that just randomly selects one of several different items that you specify, then you can still use Perchance, but it might be a bit excessive for such a simple task. That said, the advantage of using Perchance for something like this is that it makes it really easy to add different weights/chances to each item and to extend it with some additional complexity later if needed. Perchance is designed to allow you to create random generators that have a lot of complexity, without requiring any existing coding knowledge, and with a fairly simple interface.
Perchance is based on [HTML/CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css), and [JavaScript](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming), and my secret mission with Perchance is to get people interested in coding with a smooth, fun learning-curve. If you enjoy using Perchance and want to take your coding skills to the next level, you might like to learn to code on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming), or [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
Finally, Perchance's structure is based on other awesome random text languages like [randomgen](http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen) by Orteil and [Rant](https://github.com/rant-lang/rant) by TheBerkin. Many thanks to these and other [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) creators which inspired Perchance's syntax and functionality. You might also like to check out [Chartopia](https://chartopia.d12dev.com/) - another website which allows you to make random generators. If you like the HTML/JS coding aspect of Perchance, and don't really need the generator stuff, then [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/) may also be interesting to you.
Thanks to the contributors behind these open source software projects:
  * [Compromise](https://github.com/nlp-compromise/compromise): A JavaScript natural language library that powers pastTense and pluralForm and the like.
  * [Split.js](https://nathancahill.github.io/Split.js/): A library that allows you to easily split the screen up into resizable quadrants.
  * [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com): A great document/NoSQL database. I use it for everything.
  * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com): Helps serve you this webpage and power the internal APIs of Perchance.


Thanks for checking out Perchance! •ᴗ•

The items listed below aren't errors - they're just "warnings". Perchance generates "warnings" when it detects code in your editor panel that looks like it may be a mistake, but which is technically not "erroneous" - that is, it's valid Perchance syntax, but it's "unusual" code and so might have been an accident on your part. Feel free to ignore these warnings if you know what you're doing! ꒰•ᴗ•꒱

⏳ loading...
you're viewing your generator with the url **welcome** - you can:
  * change its url
  * duplicate it
  * make public
  * download it
  * delete it


close
this generator's current url is: **welcome**
to change it, just enter a new one below. remember: you can only use lower-case letters, numbers and hyphens in your url
**caution:** if you change it, the old url will no longer work! if your generator is popular, and others have imported it into their own, you will **break their generators!** (they will get import errors). because of this, if your generator is popular, it's better to make a copy of this generator rather than change this one's name
sorry, the new url must be at least 4 characters long
there was a problem connecting to the server ¯\\_(⊙_ʖ⊙)_/¯ check your internet connection?
sorry, a generator with that name already exists (⌐■_■)

if you click the button below, it will load a list of older versions of your generator so you can download them in case you accidentally deleted your code, or there was a system error. copies of your generator code are also backed-up to your local browser storage, so if your computer ever crashes and you hadn't saved in a while, you'll be able to come here to recover your data.
load backup/revision history

hmm (⊙_☉) there was some sort of server error while trying to get your revision history. sorry! this doesn't happen very often. if it keeps happening (and you've checked your internet connection), could you please make a post on the [forum](https://lemmy.world/c/perchance)?
