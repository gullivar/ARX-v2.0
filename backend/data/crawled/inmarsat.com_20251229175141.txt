NexusWave Fleet Xpress Safety Narrowband
NexusWave

Fully managed bonded connectivity solution (GEO Ka-band + LEO + LTE + L-band) for an office-like and home-like internet experience at sea.

Fleet Xpress

Fleet Xpress continues to offer dependable, managed connectivity services backed by Inmarsat’s expertise. This proven connectivity service provides valuable support for day-to-day operations and crew welfare.

Safety

Safety is in our DNA – established in 1979 by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to deliver dependable satellite safety communications.

Narrowband

For those fleets that don’t need the power of digitalisation or a high-speed crew internet service just yet, narrowband remains a cost-efficient solution to keep your vessel connected.

Inmarsat Maritime continues to power the digitalisation, decarbonisation and crew welfare of the maritime industry.

Inmarsat Maritime, a Viasat company, is driving the future of shipping - powering digitalisation, decarbonisation, and crew welfare across the global maritime industry and delivering fast, global, secure, reliable connectivity where it matters most.

 

Your connectivity partner should deliver not just for today, but for tomorrow. That’s why we are investing in our high-capacity satellite network and value-added services to give shipowners and operators the certainty they need - from safety and business-critical applications to operational efficiency and keeping crews connected with loved ones.
