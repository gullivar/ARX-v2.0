Your attendees are bored (if they show up at all), and you can't track your webinar back to revenue. Start for Free Book A Demo Webinars for Revenue Teams Features That Work For You (even while you're sleeping) 🤫 Attendee Engagement Engagement Analytics Identify Intent Webinar ROI Attendee Engagement Use polls, featured actions, and handouts to invite audience participation, identify top engaged attendees, and conduct market research. You can even bring attendees to the stage, so they can be a part of the content, rather than simply observing it. Increase your webinar attendance through automated, customizable, and branded email notifications. Build relationships among attendees (and hosts) with the power of real-time chats. Hosts can tag specific questions for a dedicated Q&A and use emojis and @ mentions to drive conversation. Engagement Analytics You know marketing doesn’t stop at acquisition. Cultivating a successful relationship happens at every milestone you share with your customers. Your job is to make them look good, and we know you take that job seriously. Work with Demio to create quality experiences that make it easy to engage your customers, help them grow, and earn their loyalty. Identify Intent Track exactly who downloaded your handouts, participated in your polls, clicked your featured actions, and drove conversation in your chat. Use your insights to identify attendees who were most engaged during your session. Learn who was most focused during your session (and who was nodding off), to help you understand which attendees prioritize in your post webinar campaigns. Integrate Demio’s webinar data with your marketing automation platform (or CRM) to drive your engaged attendees to the next step in their buyers journey. Webinar ROI Put your webinars on autopilot with automated and on-demand events. Generate leads in your sleep, while you’re cooking dinner, while you’re walking the dog, while you’re in meetings, (you get it…). Work smarter, not harder. Enhance your data by capturing important information from new leads with custom registration fields. Upon registration, automatically redirect contacts to a custom URL of your choice. Make your brand memorable. Use your logo and color palette in your dedicated and customizable registration page, email notifications, and webinar room.
