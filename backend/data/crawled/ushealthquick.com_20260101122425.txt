Working with Children and Young People WPA Insurance Exclusive Service Neuropsychology-Led Case Management For individuals with complex neurological or psychological needs, managing care across multiple services can feel overwhelming. Rehabilitation, education, and medical support often overlap, and without clear coordination, families may struggle to access the right help at the right time. Neuropsychology-led case management provides a structured, clinically informed way of bringing these elements together so that recovery and wellbeing are supported in the most effective way possible. Enquire Now Our Approach At The London Neurocognitive Clinic, our case management is guided by clinical psychologists specialising in neuropsychology who understand the biopsychosocial consequences of brain-related conditions. This approach means that recommendations are not only practical but also grounded in specialist clinical expertise. We coordinate across healthcare, education, and legal systems, ensuring that every intervention aligns with the individual’s unique needs. By combining neuropsychological insight with case management structure, we help clients and families navigate complex pathways with clarity and confidence. What is neuropsychology-led case management? Neuropsychology-led case management is a service designed to bring together all aspects of care for individuals with neurological conditions, such as acquired brain injury, functional neurological disorder, or neurodevelopmental difficulties. Unlike traditional case management, this approach places a clinical expert in neuropsychology at the centre, ensuring that rehabilitation strategies are evidence-based and tailored to the person’s cognitive and emotional profile. This includes creating individualised rehabilitation plans, setting realistic goals, and making sure interventions are implemented consistently across health, education, and social settings. Families often find that this integrated model reduces stress, prevents duplication of services, and ensures progress is properly monitored. Who benefits most from case management? Case management is particularly valuable for people with complex needs, such as those recovering from traumatic or acquired brain injury, children with overlapping developmental and learning difficulties, or adults managing neurological conditions alongside mental health challenges. Families benefit by having one clear point of contact, while professionals across medical, educational, and legal fields gain from coordinated communication. This helps to ensure that care remains person-centred and that no aspect of recovery is overlooked. How does this differ from standard case management? Standard case management often focuses on organising logistics and coordinating services. While important, this approach may lack the clinical depth required to fully understand complex neurocognitive needs. At The London Neurocognitive Clinic, neuropsychologists bring an additional layer of expertise, ensuring that case management decisions are informed by scientific knowledge of cognition, behaviour, and emotional functioning. This means that every recommendation-from therapy provision to school reintegration or workplace support, is grounded in clinical evidence, making the service more effective and future-focused. Questions our clients ask Frequently asked questions You may have lots of questions and that’s understandable. We have provided some answers below to frequently asked questions but if you’re still unsure about something do get in contact with us. Do you work with medico-legal teams as part of case management? Yes. We frequently collaborate with solicitors, expert witnesses, and medico-legal services to provide structured case management for individuals involved in personal injury or clinical negligence cases. This ensures that the neuropsychological evidence is fully integrated into rehabilitation planning and that recommendations stand up in both clinical and legal contexts. Can case management include support with education or work? Absolutely. Many of our clients need help reintegrating into education or employment following neurological illness or injury. We work with schools, universities, and employers to recommend reasonable adjustments, support strategies, and phased return plans. This ensures that progress is sustainable and that the individual’s cognitive and emotional needs are properly supported. How often are case management reviews carried out? The frequency of case management reviews depends on the complexity of the case and the stage of recovery. Typically, we recommend regular reviews to monitor progress, update goals, and adjust interventions where necessary. This ensures that care remains dynamic and responsive as the individual’s needs change over time. Have Questions?
