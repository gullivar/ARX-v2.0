                - By Year These are the greatest or best films of each year, 
		  sometimes called the 'essential' films, the 'must-see' films 'before you die', 
		  the all-time best films, the 'A-list' films, or the top films, including a 
		  strong mix of foreign-language films - although not all award-winning 
		  or notable films could be listed or described. There is also a sampling of some independent and cult films. Many of the entries have short or brief
              capsule summaries, and some provide links to much longer essays.
              Select an individual year within a decade for a listing of the
              greatest films for that particular year. Each of the films is labeled
            with Film
              Genre icons, designating whether it is a drama, comedy,
            adventure film, horror film, etc., or a hybrid combination. One way to look at films is to concentrate
              on each individual year's releases. It's a good method to recognize
              the flow and the trends of films, to see those that performed best,
              and to look at those that came to the forefront or were critically
          important. There are also additional links below
            to learn more about hundreds of important films. See also: > > Greatest

              first launched, filmsite.org was one of the first
              websites to initiate the trend to select 100 Greatest Films in
              the history of cinema. About Film Historian: Tim Dirks Tim Dirks created the popular filmsite.org website, aka Filmsite or Greatest
                  Films ,
                in mid-1996, and the site celebrates its landmark 30th

                spanning all the years of cinematic history, often writes
                blogs and other film-related articles, and has engaged in a
                number of on-camera interviews about film. Wikipedia has called the site "an introduction to cinematic
                literacy," and CultureSonar referred to the site as "A One-Man IMDb." The site
                has averaged over time about 10 million page views per year
                (see visitor and traffic statistics ). Roger Ebert: Endorsement Film critic and columnist Roger Ebert, author of The Great Movies (2002), The Great Movies II (2005), and The Great Movies III (2010) made
              many detailed references to filmsite.org in his Chicago Sun-Times "Answer Man" column and in
              his many writings about the Great Movies over the years. He has
              written that the site is "an invaluable repository of movie
              descriptions and dialogue" and that it is an "awesome
              website [that] contains detailed descriptions of 300 great
