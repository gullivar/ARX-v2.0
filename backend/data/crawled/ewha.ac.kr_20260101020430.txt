Comprehensive Rating Ewha Moves up in 2025 JoongAng Ilbo University Rankings to Sixth in Comprehensive Rating Ewha Womans University ranked sixth in comprehensive standing in the 2025 JoongAng Ilbo University Rankings, up one notch from last year. The achievement reflects a strong evaluation, amid fierce competition, of Ewha’s reputable curricula, outstanding graduate employability, and robust research support systems. Subject Ranking Introduced to Rate Academic Performance in Across Nine Disciplines This year, JoongAng Ilbo introduced discipline-based evaluations for the first time, to assess in greater detail each university’s individual characteristics and field-specific strengths. Their subject ranking covers nine disciplines: languages, literature, and the humanities; social sciences; business and economics; electrical, electronic, telecommunications and computer engineering; materials science and chemical and energy engineering; mechanical, aerospace and transportation engineering; construction, urban and environmental engineering; mathematics, physics, astronomy and earth sciences; chemistry, life sciences, agriculture and forestry and fisheries. Academic performances in these nine fields were evaluated based on common indicators including research funding, publications, citations and employability, as well as additional field-specific indicators. Ewha Receives “Exceptional” Ratings in Humanities and Business; “Excellent” Ratings in Social Sciences, Natural Sciences and Engineering In the subject rankings, Ewha demonstrated particularly remarkable achievements in the humanities and in business. In the languages, literature and humanities discipline, Ewha was awarded an “exceptional” rating in recognition of its full-time faculty ratio, stable research environment and educational innovation in response to digital transformation. Ewha earned another “exceptional” rating in the business and economics discipline, for its high graduate employability, low dropout rates, and outstanding number of top 10 percent international research publications. In the social sciences discipline, Ewha received an “excellent” rating for showing strong numbers in Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) indicator per faculty member. Across all major disciplines in the natural sciences and engineeringelectrical, electronic, telecommunications and computer engineering; mathematics, physics, astronomy and earth sciences; and chemistry, life sciences, agriculture and forestry and fisheriesEwha received “excellent” ratings, demonstrating the institution’s outstanding capabilities in research and education in both basic sciences and applied technologies. Recognition Earned for Student-Centered Educational Innovations and Improvements in University Research Ecosystem  Ewha’s rise in this year’s ranking was primarily driven by a student-centered approach to academic affairs management and improvements made to its research environment. The school’s double major system, self-designed major modules and enhancements in its faculty mentorship system have helped establish an academic system that enables students to design their own learning and career paths. Ewha’s academic competitiveness has also been boosted by support programs that allow a seamless transition from undergraduate research opportunities to graduate studies and professional competence. There were improvements as well in Ewha’s research performance, including international collaborative research and international journal citations. Future Tasks for Strengthening Global Competitiveness In pursuit of global excellence, Ewha Womans University is currently pursuing core strategies to vitalize international collaborative research and to improve individual faculty members’ citation impact indicators. These strategies will be supported by efforts to restructure the university’s faculty review criteria through the adoption of specialized outside evaluation and of adjusted evaluation standards for individual colleges; and by efforts to strengthen university communications through multilingual international promotions of Ewha’s achievements in research and through the expansion of international networks. In preparation of the school’s 140th anniversary, Ewha is seeking to attract outstanding researchers and lay the foundation for global research cooperation by revamping its multilingual researcher / laboratory websites and by further promoting faculty research and publications. The newly launched Ewha Global Excellence Program to support medium- and long-term research will also serve as a key foundation for global excellence. The 2025 JoongAng Ilbo University Rankings reaffirm Ewha’s strengths in the humanities, social sciences and business, while also showing its strong growth potential in the natural sciences and engineering. Ewha plans to further enhance its reputation in the humanities and social sciences, while improving quantitative indicators in the natural sciences and engineering, with an aim to solidify its global competitiveness. Ewha Selected for 2025 National Research Laboratory Program to Pioneer World Class Research Across Disciplines Ewha Selected for 2025 National Research Laboratory Program to Pioneer World Class Research Across Disciplines The Institute for Multiscale Matter and Systems (IMMS) at Ewha Womans University has been selected for the 2025 National Research Laboratory (NRL 2.0) program, a major government grant supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT and the Ministry of Education. The selection reaffirms on a national level Ewha’s long-established world-class research ecosystem and convergence research capabilities, conferring the school with the mission to serve for the next ten years as a research hub for Korea’s national strategic technologies to addresses the challenges of the future. The NRL 2.0 program was launched in 2025 as a core national strategy initiative for science and technology, with an aim to foster research institutions that reach beyond basic science, toward problem-solving, convergence-driven research addressing complex technological and industrial challenges. Following the call for proposals in April, preliminary and pitch evaluations were carried out, resulting in the selection of four institutes, including Ewha IMMS. Through the NRL 2.0 program, Ewha IMMS will receive a block grant of KRW 10 billion annually for ten years, amounting to a total of KRW 100 billion, and will take the lead in conducting problem-solving, convergence-driven research centered on multiscale materials, addressing issues related to national strategic technologies and various challenges for the mankind. IMMS’s operation plan comprises technical groups (TG) for basic research, to focus on specialization in the national strategic technologies, and core projects (CP) for application and expansion, aiming at solving Korea’s national challenges; the two branches which will be managed as a matrix structure to simultaneously pursue advancement and expansion in research. Each CP will partner with prominent institutions at Harvard University, ETH Zurich, University College London and other leading universities to expand Ewha’s international collaborative research and to strengthening university-industry collaboration, which will help develop Ewha into an innovative global research platform. IMMS Director Hoi Ri Moon remarked, “Ewha’s research teams have already produced numerous internationally recognized achievements,” adding, “The decisive factor in Ewha’s selection for NRL 2.0 was the university’s capabilities and potential for growth in advanced technology.” Professor Moon underscored the institute’s vision and strong commitment, saying, “Through convergence research that crosses disciplinary boundaries, we are determined to solve Korea’s national challenges in science and technology.” Ewha’s selection for NRL 2.0 is a concrete outcome of Ewha’s future strategy. With IMMS at the center of its vision for the future, Ewha will embark on expanding global collaborative research platforms, and on solving challenges while developing new industries related to AI-based precision materials design, climate and energy, advanced semiconductors, and secondary batteries. Through its efforts in research innovation and world-class collaboration to address the challenges of our time, the university plans to evolve into a global research university contributing to scientific and technological advancement beyond Korea. Ewha President Hyang-Sook Lee issued a message underlining the university’s vision for the project, emphasizing that “the goal of the NRL 2.0 program, which is to pioneer world-class innovative research, aligns perfectly with Ewha’s vision. It will be an opportunity for Ewha’s IMMS, composed of research teams with outstanding capabilities, to grow into a global innovative research institute in material technologies.” READ MORE College News Undergraduate Students in Fashion Design Win Awards at the 28th KOFIA International Fashion Illustration Competition Graduate Students from the Department of Physics Receive Awards at the 2025 Korean Physical Societ and ICAMD 2025 Professor Choi Saet-byul of the Department of Sociology Appointed President of the Korean Sociological Association The 3rd “Food & Nutrition Night” Successfully Held Ewha Faculty Selected for Outstanding Achievements in the Academic Research Support Program READ MORE Research Achievements Ewha Researchers Discover Novel Therapeutic Strategy to Combat Alzheimer’s Research Achievements Ewha Researchers Discover Key Mutation That Strengthens Protein Synthesis Accuracy Research Achievements Ewha Brain Institute Team Led by Chair Professor In Kyoon Lyoo Publishes Breakthrough PTSD Study....
