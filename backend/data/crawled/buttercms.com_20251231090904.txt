You can manage everything in one place and deliver it anywhere, from websites, to mobile apps, to digital displays. It’s API-first and frontend agnostic, giving developers complete control over their stack, while marketers launch pages, update content, and ship campaigns. No handoffs, no holdups. The future of commerce  is composable Unlike rigid, all-in-one platforms (we’re looking at you, Wordpress and Shopify), composable architecture is modular, flexible, and designed to evolve with you. With an API-first approach, connect best-in-class tools with ease. It’s how modern teams move faster, adapt easier, and build for what’s next. As part of a composable architecture, a headless CMS becomes the content foundation. For example, you could use ButterCMS for content, Shopify for commerce, and Algolia for search. Your stack, your way. This isn’t just the future of content. It’s the future of commerce. Start for Free Request a Demo What devs and teams are saying “We've had a great experience using ButterCMS.
