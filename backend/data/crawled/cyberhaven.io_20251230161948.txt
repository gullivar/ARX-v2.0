Intro to Cyberhaven (1:40)
Reimagined DLP and Insider Threat 

Legacy DLP can’t keep up with the way data is shared in dynamic work environments. Cyberhaven combines content inspection with context from data lineage to give you smarter, faster, and easier data protection—without disrupting the business.

Protect your data in the AI era, without disrupting your business.

Let’s face it, traditional DLP and insider threat tools consistently disappoint. They’re clunky, generate tons of false positives, and miss modern data consumption patterns. These traditional tools were built for a world where data lived in files and a few databases.

Today, data is fragmented and derivative: copied, pasted, captured in screenshots, embedded, and summarized. In the AI era, the data perimeter is broken.

Cyberhaven protects data in this new reality. We reimagined DLP and insider threat from the ground up to create Data Detection and Response (DDR), combining the best capabilities of traditional data security tools in one integrated platform. The result: Cyberhaven not only outperforms each category, but is more effective than the sum of its parts.

Data loss prevention

Protect data with reimagined DLP built from the ground up; block leaks across email, web, cloud, and devices.

Insider risk management

Combine data and behavior signals to stop insider threats, clarify intent, and catch slow-burn risks.

AI data security

Secure AI adoption with visibility, risk assessments, and precise controls that prevent leaks without blocking teams.

Data security posture management

Discover and classify data, detect risk as it flows between clouds and devices, and secure it automatically.

Context is why Cyberhaven is smarter, easier, and more effective at protecting your data.

Our AI-native platform doesn't just inspect content: it traces its entire journey. See where data lives, comes from, how it changed, and who interacted with it. We’ve reimagined DLP and insider threat with AI-powered automation and streamlined controls, so you finally get real protection that’s easy to manage.

Data lineage

Our data lineage technology maps the full journey of sensitive data, from creation to every movement, transformation, and fragmentation.
AI-based content intelligence
Cyberhaven uses AI to classify sensitive data the moment it’s created and continuously updates that classification as the data evolves.
