What to Capitalize in a Title Understanding what to capitalize in a title is important to make sure that your titles and headlines look correct. If you’re confused about what words to capitalize in a title or headline, we recommend using our title capitalization tool above, but if you want specific capitalization rules, they are as follows. First, it is important to note that there are four main title capitalization styles: Chicago style, APA style, MLA style, and AP style . Each of these capitalization styles has slightly different rules for which words are capitalized and each of these styles can be written using title case capitalization or sentence case capitalization. What Is Title Case Capitalization? Title case is the most common form of title and headline capitalization and is found in all four major title capitalization styles. Title case is also commonly used for book titles, movies titles, song names, plays, and other works. In general, the following capitalization rules apply across the four styles in title case: Capitalize the first word in the title Capitalize the last word in the title Capitalize the important words in the title Important words in that last bullet generally refer to: Adjectives (tiny, large, etc.) Adverbs (quietly, smoothly, etc.) Nouns (tablet, kitchen, book) Pronouns (they, she, he) Subordinating conjunctions (when fewer than 5 letters) Verbs (write, type, create) Title case is the most common title capitalization for book titles, headlines, articles titles, etc. When multiple letters in a title need to be capitalized, use title case capitalization. Words Not Capitalized in Title Case While the above words are generally capitalized in titles regardless of style, there are some words that are generally not capitalized when using title case. Again, these will depend on the specific style you choose (see Title Capitalization Rules by Style section). These include short words and conjunctions: Articles (a, an, the) Coordinating Conjunctions (and, but, for) Short (fewer than 4 letters) Prepositions (at, by, to, etc.) What Is Sentence Case? The other major type of title capitalization standard is sentence case. Sentence case simply means you capitalize the first letter of a sentence, proper nouns , and nothing else as opposed to capitalizing almost every first letter in title case. It is the same across all of the four styles. For more specific title capitalization rules, you can see the following sections which cover each style of title capitalization rules or check out our FAQs for common capitalization questions. Our tool lets you convert the case of your text easily into sentence case. [ays_quiz id=’58’] Title Capitalization Rules by Style Not sure which style to use? See the “ What Title Case Style Should You Use? ” section above. Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA) 7th Edition Capitalization Rules Making sure you have the right capitalization for APA headings is crucial for scholarly articles. The following rules apply to APA headline capitalization and title capitalization: Capitalize the first word of the title/heading and of any subtitle/subheading Capitalize all major words (nouns, verbs including phrasal verbs such as “play with”, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns) in the title/heading, including the second part of hyphenated major words (e.g., Self-Report not Self-report) Capitalize all words of four letters or more. Note: APA doesn’t say whether the last word of a title should be capitalized or not, which means that certain prepositions could be lowercase, such as in “When the Lights Go on.” Stylistically, we feel this doesn’t look good in a title, so we have chosen to capitalize the last word in APA in our tool.
