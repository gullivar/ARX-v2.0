Why people choose Termius

SSH available anywhere in the world

SSH keys are pretty easy to export and get going on other devices with Terminus, some of them I had to manually export and annotate user at the end of keys but that's not too bad.

The best terminal client

I am very very happy with the program, and using it for many years by now. Ability to use MOSH, SFTP, gpt even is a deal-maker; and visual styling is just another level of convenient and cool.

Best SSH terminal for Windows

The best app I've used to date

I've been using it for years, I started using it on the iphone, when I had my first mac I started using it too. I recommend it, to this day I have nothing to complain about, not to mention that it is free, there are more payments that do not even have the amount of resources that it provides. Congratulations to those who developed this tool.

Absolutely Essential

Been using Termius for a few years now. Absolutely essential to my job. It's far easier than putty. They have a feature to create keys and automatically push them to the server saving me a lot of time.

Nice work!

Easily transfer and receive files between my laptop and phone. Great design, simple for creation of common connections. Dig a little deeper and all the advanced features are there. No ads!
