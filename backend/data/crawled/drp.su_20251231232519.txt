Hello! My name is Artur Kuzyakov. I am the author and founder of DriverPack
From a small piece of software written on pure enthusiasm 8 years ago, we have transformed into the company which has helped more than 40 million people worldwide to configure their computers!

During this time, our software has become incredibly faster and smarter. Today, DriverPack is the largest database of unique drivers in the world, located on ultra high speed servers all over the world. In order to perform the process of driver installation always quickly and with the highest possible quality, we use machine learning technologies that makes our selection algorithm even better and more accurate. We have managed to achieve all this in such a way that the software remains absolutely free of charge, and everyone can use it.

My team and I are proud of our product, and we hope it will become your reliable assistant in configuring any computer in the shortest possible time frame. We spend all our time in order to save yours!
Mass media publications about DriverPack

Any user can fix all the errors and set up proper operation of the system and all its devices in just two clicks. At the moment, the number of drivers in the DriverPack database has already exceeded 1.1 million entries, and they all have been tested for safety. Read more

The need to seek and install drivers each time when you reinstall Windows is, in my opinion, one of the most significant flaws of the entire Windows family. As far back as in 2008, I decided to fix this problem and wrote my own software which was called DriverPack. Today, my product is used by 40 million users all over the world, and I consider that the drivers problem in Windows has now been solved, albeit by means of a third-party solution. Read more
The new version provides a user with more tools for making up his own driver selection. It’s an especially pressing issue for those who service computers and administer lots of different hardware. Now it is possible to integrate any alternative driverpacks into DriverPack rather than just removing the unnecessary. Read more
