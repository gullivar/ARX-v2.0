Tables in the MVC Paradigm in MQL5: Customizable and sortable table columns
In the article, we will make the table column widths adjustable using the mouse cursor, sort the table by column data, and add a new class to simplify the creation of tables based on any data sets.
Reimagining Classic Strategies (Part 20): Modern Stochastic Oscillators
This article demonstrates how the stochastic oscillator, a classical technical indicator, can be repurposed beyond its conventional use as a mean-reversion tool. By viewing the indicator through a different analytical lens, we show how familiar strategies can yield new value and support alternative trading rules, including trend-following interpretations. Ultimately, the article highlights how every technical indicator in the MetaTrader 5 terminal holds untapped potential, and how thoughtful trial and error can uncover meaningful interpretations hidden from view.
From Novice to Expert: Navigating Market Irregularities
Market rules are continuously evolving, and many once-reliable principles gradually lose their effectiveness. What worked in the past no longer works consistently over time. Today’s discussion focuses on probability ranges and how they can be used to navigate market irregularities. We will leverage MQL5 to develop an algorithm capable of trading effectively even in the choppiest market conditions. Join this discussion to find out more.
Creating Custom Indicators in MQL5 (Part 2): Building a Gauge-Style RSI Display with Canvas and Needle Mechanics
In this article, we develop a gauge-style RSI indicator in MQL5 that visualizes Relative Strength Index values on a circular scale with a dynamic needle, color-coded ranges for overbought and oversold levels, and customizable legends. We utilize the Canvas class to draw elements like arcs, ticks, and pies, ensuring smooth updates on new RSI data.
Statistical Arbitrage Through Cointegrated Stocks (Part 9): Backtesting Portfolio Weights Updates
This article describes the use of CSV files for backtesting portfolio weights updates in a mean-reversion-based strategy that uses statistical arbitrage through cointegrated stocks. It goes from feeding the database with the results of a Rolling Windows Eigenvector Comparison (RWEC) to comparing the backtest reports. In the meantime, the article details the role of each RWEC parameter and its impact in the overall backtest result, showing how the comparison of the relative drawdown can help us to further improve those parameters.
Pure implementation of RSA encryption in MQL5
MQL5 lacks built-in asymmetric cryptography, making secure data exchange over insecure channels like HTTP difficult. This article presents a pure MQL5 implementation of RSA using PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, enabling safe transmission of AES session keys and small data blocks without external libraries. This approach provides HTTPS-like security over standard HTTP and even more, it fills an important gap in secure communication for MQL5 applications.
Larry Williams Market Secrets (Part 1): Building a Swing Structure Indicator in MQL5
A practical guide to building a Larry Williams–style market structure indicator in MQL5, covering buffer setup, swing-point detection, plot configuration, and how traders can apply the indicator in technical market analysis.
Creating Custom Indicators in MQL5 (Part 1): Building a Pivot-Based Trend Indicator with Canvas Gradient
In this article, we create a Pivot-Based Trend Indicator in MQL5 that calculates fast and slow pivot lines over user-defined periods, detects trend directions based on price relative to these lines, and signals trend starts with arrows while optionally extending lines beyond the current bar. The indicator supports dynamic visualization with separate up/down lines in customizable colors, dotted fast lines that change color on trend shifts, and optional gradient filling between lines, using a canvas object for enhanced trend-area highlighting.
Tables in the MVC Paradigm in MQL5: Integrating the Model Component into the View Component
In the article, we will create the first version of the TableControl (TableView) control. This will be a simple static table being created based on the input data defined by two arrays — a data array and an array of column headers.
