Case Study
Backed by Partners Across Industries

We tested IPRoyal proxies across tens of thousands of websites and achieved a success rate of over 95%. It was a substantial improvement over our previous average of 80%. A success rate this high gave us the confidence to rely on IPRoyal’s solutions rather than building our own proxy layer in-house.
