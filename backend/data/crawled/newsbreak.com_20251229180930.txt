Billie Lourd pays tribute to mom Carrie Fisher 9 years after her death: ‘I will never stop missing you’

Billie Lourd has shared a touching tribute to her mom Carrie Fisher on the ninth anniversary of her death. The actor, 33, said in an Instagram post that she will “never stop missing” the Star Wars star, who died aged 60 in 2016 . Lourd, who shares two children with her husband Austen Rydell, reflected on spending time with her father, Bryan Lourd, and her three-year-old daughter, Jackson , while remembering her mother. She wrote that Jackson and Bryan have a special relationship, describing them as two “old souls that have known each other forever.” “Watching my dad with my kids is one of the greatest joys I’ve ever known,” Lourd wrote. “Then I started thinking about how this joy wouldn’t be possible without my mom. This joy only exists because she existed. So even though she is not physically part of this joy, she is part of the reason for it. Even though she is not alive she lives on through this joy.” Lourd went on to say her grief changes constantly, but that it felt “bittersweet” at that moment.

At least 1 dead, 1 injured after helicopters collide in New Jersey

HAMMONTON, NJ — One person died, and another is in critical condition after two helicopters crashed in a midair collision in New Jersey, authorities said on Dec. 28. The two helicopters "collided in mid-air" near the Hammonton Municipal Airport in New Jersey at around 11:25 a.m. local time on Dec. 28, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Hammonton is a town about 34 miles outside of Philadelphia. At the time of the incident, the FAA said only the pilots were on board each aircraft. The helicopters involved were an Enstrom F-28A and an Enstrom 280C, according to the FAA. Hammonton Police Chief Kevin Friel said officers had received a call about an aviation crash between two helicopters. Both helicopters crash-landed, and one was engulfed in flames, he added. "There is confirmed one fatality at this point and one subject transported by EMS with critical life-threatening injuries," Friel said, adding that local police, fire, and emergency personnel helped extinguish the helicopter in flames. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash. Local fire officials asked people avoid the area to allow emergency personnel to operate safely. Acting New Jersey Gov. Tahesha Way said in a statement that her office has
