which was slow and didn’t provide any support. PrintNode gave great 
pre-sales support and easy access to any information I requested, 
even better implemented a feature requested before I had even 
signed up. The easiest & best API for any automated printing tasks. Dave Macaulay Senior Developer, Gene Commerce PrintNode is an excellent choice for integrating printing into applications 
of all sorts. We found PrintNode when we were developing a custom PHP 
application that needed to integrate with a label printer. 
PrintNode was extremely well documented, quick and easy to integrate 
and just works right away when installed. Since we had such a pleasurable 
experience the first time, when we developed an android and iOS app that 
needed printing functionality, PrintNode was the obvious choice, 
once again, it worked flawlessly. From now on, PrintNode is always our 
go to for any application that requires an integration with a printer! Josh Wegener Owner, The Tuna Group We are using PrintNode for printing courier labels in our warehouse. 
We love it because it just works. Norbert Molenkamp Product Manager, PLT Products Printers are a necessary evil and have always been extremely 
painful to interact with from our websites. We print on to 
labels with precise dimensions and layouts. Overnight 
Printnode changed this for us, Printnode was extremely 
easy to implement and lets us enable our users to print 
without us having to worry about what browser they're using 
or if they can view PDFs Robert Coleman CTO & OPs, Etailers Ltd PrintNode is a key component in ClearPathGPS' operational infrastructure. 
The API provides the flexibility to handle local and remote data for 
print jobs. Invoices, packing list, product and shipping labels 
all flow through PrintNode 24x7. Friendly support too! Chris Fowler Managing Partner, Technology & Operations, ClearPathGPS LLC We are really happy with PrintNode service, which we have been 
trying out for about a month now. Currently have 7 computers 
and over 50 printers connected to PrintNode, with over 600 
prints we haven't had any issue sending prints to the printers. 
We actually did compared PrintNode with Google CloudPrint, 
PrintNode pretty much win on every aspect. Dedicated client 
software for both Widnows and Mac, easy to install and configure. 
Easy to use API, detailed document and wide range of samples. 
Speed of printing is amazing, almost instant print after 
calling the API. We would definitely recommend PrintNode 
to others, please keep up the good work! Frank Liu Senior Developer, Orite IT Solutions Working with PrintNode has really changed the way we send 
print jobs all around the country. I am able to send print 
jobs to specific printers no matter their location with 
basic programming and I know the job is sent, received 
and executed 100% of the time. Because of PrintNode, 
I can truly think "Sky's the limit" with cloud printing. 
I will be a client for life. Kyle Bagley CEO, DataHawk Technologies We found PrintNode when developing a custom shipping application 
using EasyPost to buy and print (via the PrintNode client) shipping labels for all of our 
UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL and other carrier shipments.  After quick initial success with PrintNode, 
we realized their ability to support readings from scales might also be useful.  We've since developed 
a fully customized piece weight counting application using PrintNode.  This new tool has dramatically sped up 
our order processing time and helped increase our counting accuracy.  We ran into a few roadblocks 
throughout the process and reached out to their support.  We were amazed to receive a call or email back that same day 
and then actually connect with a real human who helped us solve the problem.  We are very pleased with PrintNode and look forward 
to utilizing their tool in new and creative ways in the future.  Thanks, PrintNode!
