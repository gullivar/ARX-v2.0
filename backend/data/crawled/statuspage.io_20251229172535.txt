SUPPORT & IT TEAMS
Eliminate duplicate support tickets & clunky email lists

Halt the flood of support requests during an incident with proactive customer communication. Manage subscribers directly in Statuspage and send consistent messages through the channels of your choice (email, text message, in-app message, etc.)

DEVOPS & IT TEAMS
Display the status of each part of your service

Control which components of your service you show on your page, and tap into 150+ third party components to display the status of mission-critical tools your service relies on like Stripe, Mailgun, Shopify, and PagerDuty. 

Statuspage is the communication piece of your incident management process

Keep users in the loop from ‘investigating’ through ‘resolved’.

Statuspage integrates with your favorite monitoring, alerting, chat, and help desk tools for efficient response every time.
