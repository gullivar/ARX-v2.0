Tadeu Faedrick

Senior Engineer Manager

Glean helps you get work done, rather than just find information. The moment we launched Glean, there was so much positivity.

Customer story

Steve Januario

VP of Technology

Calibrations, email, presentations, content creation, etc., have gotten so much easier. I've seen stats that say Glean saves people 2-3 hours of time a week, but I know it's saving me a lot more time than that, and if you're not using Glean today, you really should be.

Casey Carlton

Director of IT & Business Tech

In my previous roles, I looked at and tried out tools that said they could handle enterprise search, both on-prem and Saas-based, but nothing worked. So, I was skeptical at first. However, Glean quickly proved that my skepticism was invalid.

Customer story

Manu Narayan

VP of IT, Data & Business Operations

It seems every SaaS platform has added some kind of generative feature, but they only have a single window of context. Glean brings the same thoughtful approach they brought to search to enterprise Al.
