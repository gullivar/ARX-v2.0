Journal of Medical Internet Research

The leading peer-reviewed journal for digital medicine and health and health care in the internet age. 

Editor-in-Chief:

Gunther Eysenbach, MD, MPH, FACMI, Founding Editor and Publisher; Adjunct Professor, School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Canada


Impact Factor 6.0 
CiteScore 11.7 

The Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) is the pioneer open access eHealth journal, and is the flagship journal of JMIR Publications. It is a leading health services and digital health journal globally in terms of quality/visibility (Journal Impact Factor 6.0, Journal Citation Reports 2025 from Clarivate), ranking Q1 in both the 'Medical Informatics' and 'Health Care Sciences & Services' categories, and is also the largest journal in the field. The journal is ranked #1 on Google Scholar in the 'Medical Informatics' discipline. The journal focuses on emerging technologies, medical devices, apps, engineering, telehealth and informatics applications for patient education, prevention, population health and clinical care.

JMIR is indexed in all major literature indices including National Library of Medicine(NLM)/MEDLINE, Sherpa/Romeo, PubMed, PMC, Scopus, Psycinfo, Clarivate (which includes Web of Science (WoS)/ESCI/SCIE), EBSCO/EBSCO Essentials, DOAJ, GoOA and others. Journal of Medical Internet Research received a Scopus CiteScore of 11.7 (2024), placing it in the 92nd percentile (#12 of 153) as a Q1 journal in the field of Health Informatics. It is a selective journal complemented by almost 30 specialty JMIR sister journals, which have a broader scope, and which together receive over 10,000 submissions a year. 

As an open access journal, we are read by clinicians, allied health professionals, informal caregivers, and patients alike, and have (as with all JMIR journals) a focus on readable and applied science reporting the design and evaluation of health innovations and emerging technologies. We publish original research, viewpoints, and reviews (both literature reviews and medical device/technology/app reviews). Peer-review reports are portable across JMIR journals and papers can be transferred, so authors save time by not having to resubmit a paper to a different journal but can simply transfer it between journals. 

We are also a leader in participatory and open science approaches, and offer the option to publish new submissions immediately as preprints, which receive DOIs for immediate citation (eg, in grant proposals), and for open peer-review purposes. We also invite patients to participate (eg, as peer-reviewers) and have patient representatives on editorial boards.

As all JMIR journals, the journal encourages Open Science principles and strongly encourages publication of a protocol before data collection. Authors who have published a protocol in JMIR Research Protocols get a discount of 20% on the Article Processing Fee when publishing a subsequent results paper in any JMIR journal.

Be a widely cited leader in the digital health revolution and submit your paper today!

Acceptability and Use of Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence–Enabled Chatbots for Sexual and Reproductive Health Among Lesbian, Bisexual, and Queer Women of Color in the United States: Cross-Sectional Survey Study

Cisgender lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ+) women of color (WOC) experience barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in the United States (US). Barriers, including limited provider access and poor patient-provider communication, contribute to underutilization of SRH services and poorer outcomes compared to heterosexual counterparts. Digital health modalities, including telemedicine, mobile health, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled chatbots, offer potential to expand access to SRH information and services among LBQ+ WOC.

Digital Health Technologies Applied in Patients With Early Cognitive Change: Scoping Review

Digital health technologies (DHTs) have the potential to revolutionize the screening, diagnostic support, monitoring and intervention for early cognitive change. However, the full spectrum of their application and the existing evidence base in this specific patient population have not been systematically delineated.

Systematic Determinants of Global COVID-19 Burden: Longitudinal Time-Series Analysis Using Big Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence

The COVID-19 pandemic has transitioned into an endemic phase with heterogeneous resurgences. Despite widespread vaccination and public health measures, the interplay of viral evolution, population immunity, and environmental factors drives diverse global patterns of COVID-19 burden. However, how these systematic factors dynamically shape disease transmission and severity across populations remains incompletely understood.

Tele–Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Treatment of Diabetes-Related Distress in Individuals With Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

Diabetes-related distress (DD) is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and impairs quality of life. Tele-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Tele-CBT) shows potential for reducing DM-related psychological distress; prior research focused primarily on in-person CBT, leaving Tele-CBT’s efficacy poorly characterized.

Age-Specific Associations Between eHealth Literacy and Sleep Quality Among Adults: Cross-Sectional Study

Young and middle-aged adults are vulnerable to poor sleep quality. eHealth literacy, defined as the ability to effectively access and use digital health information, has been linked to improved health behaviors and may promote better sleep outcomes. However, its relationship with sleep quality remains unclear, especially across age groups. Age-related disparities in eHealth literacy may contribute to a digital health divide in sleep outcomes.

Evaluating Peer Online Forums to Support Health: Ethical and Practical Challenges

Many people use peer online forums to seek support for health-related problems. More research is needed to understand the impacts of forum use, and how these are generated. However, there are significant ethical and practical challenges with the methods available to do the required research. We examine the key challenges associated with conducting each of the most commonly used online data collection methods: surveys, interviews, forum post analysis; and triangulation of these methods. Based on our learning from the Improving Peer Online Forums (iPOF) study, an inter-disciplinary realist informed mixed methods evaluation of peer online forums, we outline strategies that can be used to address key issues pertaining to assessing important outcomes, facilitating participation, validating participants (users who consent to take part in one or more parts of the study), protecting anonymity, gaining consent, managing risk, multi-stakeholder engagement, and triangulation. We share this learning to support researchers, reviewers, and ethics committees faced with deciding how best to address these challenges. We highlight the need for ongoing open, transparent discussion to ensure the research field keeps pace with evolving technology design and societal attitudes to online data use.

Adherence to Accelerometer Use in Older Adults Undergoing mHealth Cardiac Rehabilitation: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial

Wearable accelerometers, which continuously record physical activity metrics, are commonly used in mobile health–enabled cardiac rehabilitation (mHealth-CR). The association between adherence to accelerometer use during mHealth-CR and improvement in clinical outcomes, such as functional capacity, is understudied. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technology provides novel opportunities to investigate accelerometry use patterns in relation to mHealth-CR outcomes.
