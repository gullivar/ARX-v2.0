“You have no idea what you’ve done to me. I’ve been replaying every sound you made, every way you came apart for me.” His grip tightened. “I’m not letting that go. I’m not letting you go. Fuck the friendship. I want you.” I let out a little gasp. His thumb rubbed across my lower lip. “I don’t just want to fuck you—I want to keep you. You’re my favorite sin, and I’ll commit it again and again until you understand you’re mine.” His lips twitched a little. “You’ve always been mine, Savannah.” ——- Her sister is marrying her ex.

Angel Moretti. He was the love of my life. I always knew he was ever since we were kids. We did everything together. His name is Ryder ‘Savage’ Jackson. He was my world, my everything. Until he brutally ripped my heart from my chest three years ago. He tore my heart to shreds when he humiliated me by claiming another woman in his clubhouse, in the same bed we once shared. Savage by name, Savage by nature. He didn’t even give me a chance to tell him the news I had just accused me of cheating. Me, Angel Moretti. Like I would ever do that to him. So I ran, I ran from the pain he caused me. Ran from my family. Not wanting to be seen as the disgrace, but mainly to save him and his MC from annihilation. So I fled with the life we created growing inside of me. But all good things must come to an end. When he walks into my bar three years later. So what do I? Do I run? Or face the man who destroyed me? What could go wrong? Well, everything apparently. Ryder ‘Savage’ Jackson. She was my Angel, my goddess sent to me from heaven and I fucked it up. I claimed someone I shouldn’t have and paid dearly for it. I was a damn fool to believe the lies and bullshit. Missing out on the most precious gift Angel could give me. But I will make it right. Angel Moretti thinks she can get away from me with my kid. She has another thing coming, especially when I claim them both as mine. She will have no choice but to move back home with me. She may be a Mafia Princess, but she is mine!

Uprooted from New York to a glittering Los Angeles mansion, the 17-year-old senior vows to endure one year of this gilded cage before escaping to college—and freedom. But freedom becomes a distant dream the moment she locks eyes with her new stepbrother: Mantovani d’Agostino, the infamous mafia underboss hiding behind a polished facade of wealth. Mantovani is a storm wrapped in control—ruthless, volatile, and haunted by a darkness he refuses to name. Ordered by his father to play English teacher at Candice’s elite academy while hunting the sheriff dismantling their empire, he plans to despise the innocent girl invading his world. One glance at her fragile beauty among the lilies, however, ignites a forbidden fire he can’t extinguish. She’s off-limits. She’s, his stepsister.

As Candice navigates a life of bodyguards, paparazzi, and a mother obsessed with status, she’s drawn to the brooding enigma who fleas from her presence yet watches her like she’s prey. Strange midnight visits, heated glances, and whispered commands blur the line between protection and possession. Mantovani fights to bury his hunger, but the mafia’s shadows creep closer—enemies circle, secrets unravel, and a single misstep could destroy them both. In a world where loyalty is blood and love is a death sentence, Candice and Mantovani must choose to surrender to the inferno threatening to consume them… or burn the empire down trying to resist.

*Spoiler Alert* "This is insane. You've lost your mind, Lucas. Werewolves... they don't exist." "Yes, they do. Allie... look at me. What do you remember about that night?" I flinched as Lucas cupped my sweaty face, gazing tenderly into my eyes. "We had sex, and... you bit me," I replied, my eyes wide with shock. The memories remained fragmented, and my head throbbed as I tried to recall what happened. "That's it, Allie. It explains everything. I'm sorry for biting you and putting you through this." Lucas pulled me into his embrace, and I began to sob. "What's happening to me...?" "You are in transition. You are going to become a werewolf." It all started with one drunken hookup—one accidental bite. I just wanted to celebrate my 18th birthday. I never expected to wake up feeling sore, marked, and already starting to feel strange. That guy turned out to be Lucas Kane—star forward, campus heartthrob, and secretly a werewolf alpha-in-training. He broke every pack law by biting a human. Now I'm transforming quickly, and he's the only one who can keep me alive during this transition. But I'm not just changing. I'm pregnant—with a wolf shifter's child. I want none of this. I have enough on my plate: college, anxiety, and trying to pretend I'm not falling for the brooding jerk who ruined my normal . Lucas is doing his best to stay away, but our bond is growing stronger, and the full moon is approaching. Worst of all? The pack doesn’t want a human mate, and they definitely don’t want me.

A video of my boyfriend proposing to his secretary makes it to the trending topics. Everyone squeals over how romantic and touching it is. His secretary even posts on social media, "I've waited so long for you to appear, and I'm glad I didn't give up. I'll leave my life in your hands, Mr. Emerson." One of the comments goes, "God, this is so sweet. A CEO and his secretary—I ship them!" I don't weep or cause a fuss. Instead, I close the webpage and ask my boyfriend for an explanation. That's when I hear him talking to his friends. "I didn't have a choice. She would've been forced to marry someone she doesn't love if I didn't help her." "What about Vicky? She's your actual girlfriend. Aren't you afraid of her getting mad?" "So what if she is? She's been with me for seven years—she can't live without me." Later, I have my wedding on the same day as his. Our cars drive past each other, and I exchange bouquets with his secretary. When he sees me, he breaks down.

I had proposed seven times, but Winnie Smith continued refusing to marry me. This was because the Smith family had a special test. To marry their daughters, their sons-in-law had to refrain from sleeping with their fiancees after being drugged. I tried seven times. However, every time after I regained consciousness, Winnie would be sleeping naked next to me. She would cry and throw herself into my arms. “It’s fine. We can try again. I trust you.” It was not until the eighth time that I overheard her instructing the butler, “Switch the aphrodisiac to sleeping pills, and make sure it’s a high dosage. “After he falls asleep, I’ll take it from there as usual.” While I kept my eyes shut tight, I could hear her taking off her long dress. Then, she came over to unbutton my shirt. I heard her sigh. “I’m sorry, Benjamin Lowe. Joe Anderson’s been diagnosed with cancer, and his last wish is to be with me. “Don’t worry, though. After he passes, I’ll marry you immediately.” Right then, I realized that her family’s test had been a lie she told just to marry her childhood best friend. The next day, my parents pressured me again to leave the country and inherit the family business. So, I agreed to their request. Since she wanted to marry Joe, I would wish the couple well.

The Puppy Queue

After an 800-meter run, I hide under the blanket to use the vibrating massager. At that moment, Uncle Theo barges into my room and asks coldly, "Does it feel that good?" I nod vigorously. The massage really does feel wonderful. Later, he yanks off his tie and uses it to bind my wrists. "It's too small and slow. Try me instead." I can only stare at him in bewilderment. But Uncle Theo, it's just a massage gun!

Perfect Timing

My name is Greta Ellsworth. In my past life, my best friend, Poppy McKellen, and I both married into the Lockwood family. They are a prestigious household with a long-standing legacy in alternative medicine. Poppy marries the eldest son, Bruce Lockwood, while I marry the younger son, Owen Lockwood. Poppy gives birth to three children with Bruce. They each grow up to be prodigies in medicine. Meanwhile, I have only one daughter with Owen—Wendy Lockwood. Sadly, Wendy struggles with even the most basic math and isn't very bright. Owen's pride takes over, and he is left feeling utterly embarrassed. Years later, I take Wendy to a medical symposium. When she shyly whispers, "Dad," the crowd erupts in laughter. Enraged and humiliated, Owen stabs Wendy to death. Before I can react, he turns my way and strikes me down as well. When I open my eyes again, I realize that both Owen and I have been reborn. I take in the scene of our families' matchmaking event once more. This time, Owen reaches for Poppy's hand and says, "I like you. Will you marry me?"
