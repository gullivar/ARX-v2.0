I like the longevity of the filters and the fact that cleaning them is easy. Power increase along with fuel savings are the reasons I put these filters on all of my vehicles. WILL BUY AGAIN All I can say is wow! Just installed on my 2015 f150 5.0. Very easy to follow instructions even for a non mechanic. Total installation time was 35 minutes. Love how it woke up the motor and the sound! BEST PRODUCT Excellent product. Performs as advertised. LOVE the sound. Blown away by the performance. Retired mechanic of 45 years. AWESOME Great product and immediate effects! Easy to install and sounds good under the hood. Good buy and great price from K&N! GOOD PRODUCT Fit well and was easy to install. The engine no longer sounds like a giant fan, but a true V6 instead. It definitely helps the truck feel better going up the steep grades at altitude (don't have to floor it to maintain 65). BEST QUALITY By far, the best air filter product on the market. I haven't used stock filters in many years on either cars, cycles or trucks. You cannot do better than K&N for the quality and pricing of their products.
