Take a tour to get the hang of how Rosalind works. If you don't know anything about programming, you can start at the Python Village .
            For a collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms book, go to the Textbook Track .
            Otherwise you can try to storm the Bioinformatics Stronghold right now. Python Village If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold. Bioinformatics Stronghold Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others. Bioinformatics Armory Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools. Bioinformatics Textbook Track A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org Algorithmic Heights A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany "Algorithms", the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
