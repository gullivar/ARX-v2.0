91 Club is a simple gaming platform, that is for the short introduction. Now let’s start to talk more about it, so it basically has over 1400 games ranging from lot of categories which is not just limited to single player but it also has multiplayer options. 91 Club has some default games which we made ourselves and the other 1400+ games are api based which means they are built by third party developers but you can play them and they are really fun.

About 91 Club

Well 91 Club is not just a game it is a brand, it has been in gaming industry for the past 10 years and since then it’s dominating all other game providers, Why? well because of it’s clean interface, which makes it so easy to manure throughout the site and choose any game you wish to play anytime you want. There is initially no time limit, but due to government recent implications we have enabled 2 hour remind for break which means we will not force you to not play but will give a gentle reminder to take a break.

91 Club is planning to launch many games similar to BGMI/PUBG, fortnite soon as per demand. We do not want to push beta updates cause we only want best user experience and do not want any bad reviews at all.
