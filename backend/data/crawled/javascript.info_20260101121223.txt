There are also additional series of thematic articles. Part 1 The JavaScript language Part 2 Browser: Document, Events, Interfaces Part 3 Additional articles The JavaScript language Here we learn JavaScript, starting from scratch and go on to advanced concepts like OOP. We concentrate on the language itself here, with the minimum of environment-specific notes. An introduction An Introduction to JavaScript Manuals and specifications Code editors Developer console JavaScript Fundamentals Hello, world!
