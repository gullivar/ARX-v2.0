I got really sick with respiratory issues, suspected my house having radon. Ordered EcoBlu and got very high readings over 14 pCi/L. Anything below 4 is safe. Called a radon mitigation team for emergency installation of a radon mitigation system the next day. Sure enough, EcoBlu showed the levels dropped to a safe zone of 0.5- 1.5. Bradley S. Verified Purchase EcoQube put my mind at ease due to my kids playing in the basement. I set EcoQube up in my unfinished basement. Not only is it 24-hour monitoring of my radon levels, but it also sends notifications to my phone when it gets higher due to rain or other bad weather. Mac D. Verified Purchase Felt confident in using RadonEye to check my mitigation fan. I ordered RadonEye to know whether my radon mitigation fan is still doing anything after 10 years of continuous running. I ran the device for a baseline and then turned off my radon fan. I was shocked to see in 36 hours the radon levels spiking above the safe threshold. I turned the fan back on and voila - RadonEye measured a return to safe levels. Ty S. Verified Purchase Everything about RadonEye Pro is worth it. RadonEye Pro surprised me. I strayed from the standard device/detector that my team uses and took a chance. It was well worth it. I’ve already made my money back. So, it’s paid for itself. I usually just email the app-completed PDF report right there on the spot. Jesse G. Verified Purchase EcoTracker gives me data to make informed mitigation decisions. My favorite part about EcoTracker is having four units to place around the house. It reassures me that we're on the right track. I feel confident knowing that when I leave the house, our radon system will work. Ed B. Verified Purchase Use EcoQube Pro to save time and money for any large project. I've leased a 100 of EcoQube Pro units, and I'm testing at least three schools this month, so I'm using them multiple times. The math is simple: with faster turnaround and reports ready right after I collect the units. it's a no-brainer to use EcoQube Pro for any large project.
