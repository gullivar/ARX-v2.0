Geyser is a program that allows Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers, allowing for true crossplay between both editions of the game. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible. How does it work? Geyser acts as a translator which sits between the Bedrock client and the Java server. It takes data from the Bedrock client and translates it into a format the Java server understands and vice versa. Geyser works with any modern Minecraft version and can be installed either as a plugin or ran as a standalone program. Join from anywhere Geyser can be joined from Bedrock clients on Windows 10/11, iOS, Android, and even consoles. Geyser works with a wide array of hosting providers, but can also be used as its own standalone proxy to join any Minecraft server! If you are a server owner, you can install our Floodgate plugin which allows Xbox Live authenticated Bedrock users to join without a Java Edition account!
