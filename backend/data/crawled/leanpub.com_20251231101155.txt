Modern Networking Declan Moran Modern networks like the Internet — explained as simply as possible — but no simpler . Learning how to learn: mental models Neil Keleher When we learn, our brain builds models (mental models). These models form the foundation of our understanding, our intuition (whether right or wrong) and our habits. The better we understand this model building process, the better we can learn, solve problems, deal with change and create desired change while at the same time improving ourselves.

How to Create Masters and Mastery in a Classroom Setting Edward W. Barnard A simple overlook on the Kentucky-Virginia border reveals the entire attention mechanism of modern AI. Through this real-world analogy, this book shows how Large Language Models process information and how the same patterns of cognition apply to human thinking. From that insight emerges a powerful method for teaching mastery: modeling mental models, making thinking visible, and cultivating metacognition as a classroom habit. A clear, accessible guide for educators and anyone seeking intuitive AI literacy. Beyond Blinky Nguyen Hoan Hoang Most embedded teams say they “avoid OOP” and “stick to C.”  But look closely at real C codebases and you’ll find function-pointer tables, opaque handles, and generic device arrays—manual object models built the hard way. Beyond Blinky shows how to embrace that reality consciously, using modern C++ to design firmware that is readable, portable, and owned—without sacrificing performance or control. This book is about moving past the blinking LED mindset and designing embedded systems as living architectures, not scripts. To blinky and beyond—Let's make your IO sing!

THE ART OF STRATEGY provides timeless answers to these eternal questions. It is an introduction to strategy through the insights of three strategists: Sun Tzu , John Boyd & Simon Wardley . It is a modern interpretation of Sun Tzu’s The Art of War . Residues: Time, Change, and Uncertainty in Software Architecture. Barry M O’Reilly Residuality Theory is a new way to think about the design of software systems that explains why we experience design the way we do, why certain things seem to work only sporadically, and why certain architects get it right so often regardless of which tools they use.  A new, scientific approach is defined that fuses Software Engineering, Complexity Science, and Philosophy to produce an entirely new way to think about how to design software. The result is a theoretical base that allows architecture to finally become its own discipline. The Architect’s Paradox Barry O’Reilly An introduction to philosophy for software engineers and architects that will help them understand their design process. This book helps to answer the question “Why are we like this?”.
