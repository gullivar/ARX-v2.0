My career as a software engineer spans over 25 years. I have worked on frontend
                and backend systems at scale, trading platforms, compilers, search engines. I've managed
                engineering teams that operated globally distributed critical services while helping them grow their
                skills and careers. I didn't expect all of these experiences to converge onto one project... earth.nullschool.net began in 2013 as a personal challenge
                to learn HTML/CSS and Javascript. Over the years, I incrementally added functionality and improved the code:
                new layers, faster rendering, more robust data pipelines. As traffic to the site grew, doors opened and opportunities arose. I founded Nullschool Technologies Inc.
                to convert this hobby into a business, and to pursue my passion of blending software and
                art to make Earth science accessible to everyone.
