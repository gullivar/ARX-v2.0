Bidirectional and low-latency communication for every platform

Get startedDocumentation
Performant

In most cases, the connection will be established with WebSocket, providing a low-overhead communication channel between the server and the client.

Reliable

Rest assured! In case the WebSocket connection is not possible, it will fall back to HTTP long-polling. And if the connection is lost, the client will automatically try to reconnect.

Scalable

Scale to multiple servers and send events to all connected clients with ease.

Basic example
