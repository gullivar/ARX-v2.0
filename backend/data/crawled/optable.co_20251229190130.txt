OPTABLE PLATFORM
Optable is the identity management and data collaboration platform built for the advertising ecosystem in the age of privacy.
How our platform works
Identity First
With shared identifiers like cookies & mobile IDs being phased out and audience data becoming increasingly fragmented, we empower media owners, publishers and platforms to harness the power of their first party data. Our platform makes it easy to assemble an identity graph across all your sources, enrich it with leading partner data sets, and use your ID graph for activation in the channels that matter the most for your ad business.
Give Programmatic Revenue a Boost
Ad sellers need a complete set of tools to support the many different ways that they monetize their audience data. For programmatic revenue, Optable makes it easy to plug into ID frameworks like UID 2.0 and Yahoo Connect ID. Additionally, publishers with unique first party audience data can port data into leading marketplaces like The Trade Desk and curation platforms such as Pubmatic. This allows publishers to test different monetization strategies and meet buyers where they are looking to activate.
Future Proof Your Direct
Ad Sales
It’s no secret that data driven sales teams win more share of ad spend. Optable makes it easy for media owners to collect, analyze and activate audience data no matter how complex their network or distribution is. Optable’s purpose-built tools for audience building, attribute enrichment and clean room collaboration means that sales teams can respond faster to RFPs, deliver more relevant audiences and offer deeper insights to their advertising partners.
