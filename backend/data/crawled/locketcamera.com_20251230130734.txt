Locket is a widget that shows live photos from your best friends, right to your Home Screen. You and your best friends will see new pictures from each other every time you unlock your phone. It’s a little glimpse of what everyone’s up to throughout the day.
 
HOW IT WORKS
1. Add the Locket widget to your Home Screen
2. When a friend sends you a photo, it instantly appears on your Locket widget!
3. To share a pic back, tap into the widget, take a pic with the camera, and then hit send! It appears right on your friends’ Home Screens
 
FOR YOUR CLOSE FRIENDS
• To keep things friendly, you can only have 20 friends on the app.
• On Locket, there’s no worrying about follower count, just add your best friends and family and live in the moment.
• With Locket, you’re able to be real and share photos to the people that matter.
 
REACT TO FRIENDS' PHOTOS
• Send a Locket reaction to your friends to let them know you saw their image.
• They’ll get a notification and you’ll love watching the emojis rain down on your photo.
• We don’t count or track the reactions, so you can be real and authentic without worrying about likes and filters like other platforms.
 
BUILD A HISTORY OF YOUR LOCKETS
• As you and friends snap Lockets, you’ll build up a history of all images sent.
• Share them out as photos or use our video recap feature to stitch together the memories of you and your friends, capturing those “love it” moments.
• Locket will also make you a recap video at the end of every month with all of the photos you've shared.
 
ADD LOCKETS FOR YOUR BESTIES AND CRUSHES
• Decorate your home screen with more photos and images dedicated to your crush or your bestie
• Add the “Crush” or “Best Friend” picture widget, and see photos only from that person. Plus, you can send images just to that person too!
 
Here’s what our users say:
 
“I love this app because I get to share cute pictures to my friends” - HI
“AMAZING SO WORTH IT” - rikkibear29282902
“Best app made this year” - johanjodel_

Download the free app! We’re keeping Locket free so you can send photos to the people that matter (friends, family, bestie, etc.). With Locket, your phone will feel like it’s bringing you closer to your best friends.

Locket’s innovative pairing of widgets with real-time photo updates has made it a staple of our phones. It’s helped us see small moments we might’ve missed (like our baby cousin on a swing) and big moments we wish we hadn’t missed (like our grown cousin’s graduation). Sometimes it was just reassurance our loved ones were on their way home—and that we’d see them soon.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this app, just one thing

LovinLocket

i use locket almost everyday , and i absolutely love the app. i’ve had it for about a year and a half now, and it is definitely one of my most used apps. it is such a unique and fun app that allows you to connect with your close friends. i just wish i could add more than 20 friends. at the beginning, 20 was more than enough for me, but as time has gone on, and more of my friends started getting the app, 20 just isn’t enough. i hate having to narrow down between friends just so i can add another person. it would be so much easier if i could add more than 20. it does not have to be over 50 ( as i know that would take away from the connecting experience that makes this app special with close friends), even 30 would be perfect! i have a lot of friends who agree with this opinion. and i mean it in the nicest way possible. i, and i assume many others, have made friends from traveling, school, sports, etc. , so being able to add the friends we make along the way through those things would be great! i just feel so bad when i have to unadd someone just to add another, it’s to the point where i just stopped adding people and requesting friend requests due to me reaching the limit of 20 friends. locket would be such a more fun and convenient app if i could do so!thank you,jojo

Love This App 💛(⚠️Developers Please Read⚠️)

💛LOVE LOCKET💛 I have had it since last year. It was my little baby steps into something of social media. My friend asked me to download it. She explained it to me and I literally fell in love with it. I have been posting almost every day just to show my friends what I do on a daily basis! I love the new update where it tells you to send a picture if you haven’t. I’ve been adding my best friends and because in high school some of my friends are going to be going to a different school. This should be handy when it comes to then. But ONE THING! 💛 I love this app and everything that it has but the ads just kinda messed the app up a little. I don’t know how the ad thing works, (devs please explain to me if you can), but I feel like when I’m going through my friends profiles when an add pops up it kinda makes me feel like I’m using a low budget app. I know before the ads the app was great! But after the ads it’s kinda been a meh for me. But I still love the app in all its ways and the backstory is so cute of how this came to be. Just hoping that devs can tell me about how the ads work.💛I do love how the developers actually read some of these reviews. Love the logo💛💛💛Edit: It would also be cool if you could tag people in photos. And have group chats.👍🏼Thank you!

OK, so basically this app is very fun and I love taking pictures of my daily life and stuff but there’s just some perks that I just don’t love about it. I mean you can’t make long videos and why is there no sound to the videos like I was talking a video and there was like completely no sound like I don’t know if it’s supposed to be like that but you just gotta make the videos longer like why does it cost money for videos to be longer?  something cool you you  should add to Locket should be like face emoji things that would be so fun and I feel like more people would get this app and if you could maybe make the videos be longer at least like a minute, but  otherwise there’s only a few bad things that I would change about this app, but either way this is such a great app and I would 100% download it 👍👍 it’s really fun to see how everyone day is going and see what they’re doing in their daily life and another things.  forgot to say was To be able to friend people that aren’t in your contacts because I have friends who don’t have my number but they have this app and I really would love to friend them on here but you can’t if you don’t have their number. so maybe be able to do that? Otherwise five star it’s a good app
