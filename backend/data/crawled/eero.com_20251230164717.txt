Limit screen time across individual devices or your entire home to minimize distractions at dinner, during homework, or before bed.

Instant guest wifi.

Easily create a guest network and share it with a link or a QR code.

With even more control and enhanced security, an eero Plus subscription makes it fast and easy to manage multiple networks and devices from anywhere.

Proven performance you can count on.
