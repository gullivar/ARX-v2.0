In this book, Abdel-Fattah closely follows the Al-Aqsa Flood since its outbreak on October 7, 2023. We met the political thinker and discussed with him his vision of the Flood, the role of resistance against the occupation, his interpretation of Palestinian steadfastness, and the regional and global reactions — both popular and official. We also touched on his expectations for the future of the Palestinian cause in light of the Flood […] Reviews The Fall of the Assads: The End of Half a Century of Tyranny in Syria and How it will Change the World In 1971, Hafez Al-Assad seized power in Syria and in 2000 his son Bashar Al-Assad succeeded him ruling the country until he was toppled in 2024.

The episode then moves to the political fallout beyond Gaza. We discuss the generational divide among Jewish voters highlighted by support for Zohran Mamdani, before looking at how Israel is once again pushing the US toward a possible war with Iran and the role neoconservative thinking still plays […] Africa Asia & Americas Middle East Europe Book Reviews Blog Opinion Reviews Multimedia Podcast: Middle East Monitor Conversations Podcast: Palestine This Week Editorial Guidelines About Us Palestine Book Awards Contact Us Privacy Policy MEMO Publishers All Stories Archive Subscribe to our newsletter Sign up © Ardi Associates Ltd 2009- .
