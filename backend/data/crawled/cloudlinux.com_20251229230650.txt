You’re in good company

4,000+ companies trust CloudLinux to run more than 20 million of customer websites.

As a managed hosting provider we are always looking for quality products that will help us increase efficiency and stability as well as improve the overall performance from our servers. We deployed CloudLinux on our shared hosting servers, and we have seen an immediate improvement in reliability. Now we want to offer the same solution to our dedicated server customers.
