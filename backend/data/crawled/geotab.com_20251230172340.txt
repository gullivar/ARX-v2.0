GO Focus Plus AI dash cam

Meet GO Focus Plus, the AI dash cam that calls out risks like distractions, tailgating and rolling stops the moment they happen. Drivers hear instant, in-cab voice feedback, turning critical seconds on the road into teachable moments before an incident occurs. Smart Sequence™ surfaces the most urgent events first, along with video and context, so managers can coach, review and take action without chasing footage or sorting through endless alerts. Focus on what demands your attention and change outcomes, all within Geotab's unified safety platform.
