Investing for 5+ years increases your chances of positive returns compared to cash savings. But investments rise and fall in value, so you could get back less than you put in. You’re responsible for your investment decisions.

I love 212 Trading

I love 212 Trading. Great card to pay abroad and in the UK. Saves you money and gives you cashback. You can trade on S&S ISA. Best financial tool ever. I have been using it since summer 2024

Easy to use and keep track of. Mainly use for ISAs, cash great, investment not so, but due to my ignorance and lack of knowledge rather than the app/bank.

It would be silly not to open an account

Great account for easy management of ISA savings and investments, with a great rate of interest. I particularly like the ability to create or copy investment Pies.

Trading 212 has been excellent so far

Trading 212 has been excellent so far. The setup and security verification were quick and straightforward, and transferring money in and out has been fast every time. There’s plenty of clear information on shares, companies, and funds, which makes researching much easier. It does take a little time to learn your way around the platform, but once you get used to it, everything feels smooth and intuitive. A reliable, well‑designed service overall.
