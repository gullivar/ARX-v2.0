About the RIPE NCC

We're an independent, not-for-profit membership organisation that supports the infrastructure of the Internet through technical coordination in our service region. Our most prominent activity is to act as the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) providing global Internet resources and related services (IPv4, IPv6 and AS Number resources) to members in our service region.

Our membership consists mainly of Internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunication organisations and large corporations located in Europe, the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.

We also provide services for the benefit of the Internet community at large.
