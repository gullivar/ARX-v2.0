Read docs FAQ What kinds of teams use Conduit? Any team building high-performance applications onchain. We support use cases across DeFi, TradFi, DEXs, RWAs, stablecoins, gaming, consumer apps, AI, and beyond. See some of our customers here . My app works fine running on another chain, why do I need my own? Applications often start strong on shared chains but inevitably hit scaling limits – high fees, latency, and congestion – as they compete for blockspace. A dedicated chain solves these challenges, enables full customization for your exact needs, and transforms gas fees from overhead into revenue . I want my own chain. Should I build a rollup or custom L1? It depends on your goals. Conduit supports both rollups and custom L1s, and we work closely with every team to choose the right architecture. Whether you need Ethereum alignment, full sovereignty, or a hybrid solution, we provide the infrastructure and expertise to launch the best version of your chain. Why should I launch my chain with Conduit rather than build it myself? Building a chain in-house comes with significant costs – months of work, millions in engineering costs, and coordination between many third parties (rollup frameworks, DA providers, interoperability, etc.). Ongoing maintenance, troubleshooting, and upgrade implementations add further strain post-launch. Conduit covers all of this seamlessly, starting at just $36K/year, freeing you to focus entirely on your business. Do I own my chain if I launch it with Conduit? Yes. If you need to take control of your chain or want to migrate to a different hosting platform, we’ll send the necessary keys to a wallet of your specification as soon as you ask. This is standard in our contracts. If you need our help migrating, we can do that too. Does Conduit offer support? Absolutely. Every Conduit customer gets a dedicated SLA, with options up to <1-hour response times and direct access to our engineering team. Beyond technical support, we partner strategically to optimize your chain, advise on integrations, fine-tune your GTM strategy, and ensure your long-term success. Learn more about our support plans .
