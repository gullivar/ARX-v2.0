For me, web hosting is the service that’s gonna help me show my work online. Every time I reach out to customer support, they have always been quick.

Web hosting as a service is mainly something that facilitates the process of creation. I’m glad I moved because SiteGround goes a lot more in depth than just the basics.

We’ve worked with limited CMS before and limited hosting platforms and you just don’t have the customization options that you do when you’ve got access to WordPress on the hosting plans that SiteGround offers.
