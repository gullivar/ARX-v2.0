I don’t even know what to describe this opportunity but this App is literally a game changer, have never ever been so satisfied with a App before. n jzzmssid Web user I am a digital artist and have tried dozens of remover and background apps. After trying SnapEdit I purchased the annual plan for a fabulously low cost because it is incredibly at removing objects and quite precise with background edits. When using the remover if you remove slightly above or below the object you will sometimes get a cleaner removal. ( just a Titbit if advice) I’m am super impressed and makes my edits much easier💜 Plushupholstery Product Photographer I wonder who kinder created this app!!

I tried a bunch of applications for cutting out photos, and they all couldn’t cope and I had to cut them out manually and freak out, but here everything is perfect!

Roberta Terço Product Photographer It really is incredible. The best app to edit photos of any type. I highly recommend it, it should be used by everyone. Keiverth Stiven Shop owner So far this is absolutely top tier among all the photo editor apps I've tried. The remover tool works so perfectly in all my photos when I want to remove something unnecessary. The enhancer does a pretty great job in enhancing the photo quality. Janella Dela Rosa iOS user I found this app today and I'm already in love with it! Too perfect! And best of all, you only need to see an ad to be able to edit. However, they could add an option to only blur the background of the photos, it seems that it only blurs the entire photo.
