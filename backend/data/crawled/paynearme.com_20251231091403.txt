Get started Outdated payments are holding you back Many payment providers can complete the simple task of moving money from point A to point B. But doing so efficiently, reliably and without heavy manual intervention? That takes an entirely different kind of platform—one that prioritizes experience over tradition. PayNearMe brings progress to your payments, enabling you to solve your most pressing payment problems. The end result? Increased self-service, better cash flow and profitability, and a significant reduction to your total cost of acceptance. View platform Lower your total cost of acceptance Taking payments over the phone, manually reconciling transactions, managing multiple systems - all these drive up your cost, by a lot. Deliver a modern user experience When your customers can’t pay you quickly, easily and with the payment methods and channels they prefer, they’re less likely to pay you at all. Increase acceptance rates Every unsuccessful payment is a payment that needs to collected, written off or retried, making each exception exceptionally difficult. Say goodbye to manual intervention More time spent managing technology, building features and fixing downtime means less time for innovation and growth. Why PayNearMe? Redefine what modern means Other payment providers claim to have a next-gen platform, but often fall short where it matters most. PayNearMe is purpose-built around Payment Experience Management to deliver a truly modern platform. That means going beyond the customer interface and tackling the end-to-end payment experience, from customers to support staff to operations and every interaction in between.
