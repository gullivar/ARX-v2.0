Instant refunds and targeted marketing campaigns helped us amp up our customer retention. Bulk credit management was a breeze with their intuitive dashboard.

We have been running the rewards program for our super premium cards - ‘Aurum’ powered by Poshvine (Razorpay acquired company) for the last 3 years and our customers appreciate the propositions, user interface and experience. This rewards program allows for extensive customisations and helps us improve and make strategic changes very quickly and efficiently.
