Severe Manifestations of Human Metapneumovirus With Co-infections: A Case Series and Literature Review
Aradhana ., Viveka Mishra... Nirmal K. Mohakud

Surya N. Mishra

MD, Professor

Any viral infection almost always has a link to the immune status of the individual. Human metapneumovirus also takes the same path and causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections among the immune deficient groups especially the children. Early clinical evaluation and supportive treatment is very important.

A Rare Case of Benign Esophageal Schwannoma
Abdullah Bahadi, Tehreemah Raziq... Waleed Saleh

Vishal V. Bhende

MBBS

While surgical resection offers radical treatment for esophageal schwannoma, the approach should be determined based on tumor size, location, and patient condition. Esophagectomy or local resection consisting of full-thickness excision and tumor enucleation are mainly performed. As a more radical approach, esophagectomy may lead to a high incidence of post-operative complications, such as recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, pulmonary compromise, or chylothorax. In contrast, local resection is a sufficient approach for the curative treatment of benign schwannomas and is less likely to result in serious morbidity . Furthermore, tumor enucleation is quite technically feasible because the esophageal schwannoma does not usually involve all layers of the esophageal wall and is typically limited to the submucosa . However, enucleation may not be a preferred approach for very large tumors because this has been associated with higher rates of esophageal stenosis !!

The article provides a good reminder that a combination of hyponatremia, gastrointestinal symptoms and CNS symptoms like confusion/ delirium in an elderly patient with community acquired pneumonia should prompt early consideration of Legionella infection even before microbiological confirmation.
