Thawte places trust at the center of SSL security

Trust is at the center of confidence—confidence in visiting your site, entering information, and making a purchase. When you put trust at the center of your website security, not only do you have peace of mind, your customers know their information, data, and money is protected.

What does an SSL certificate do?

A TLS/SSL certificate encrypts website digital information when it’s moving between the server and the browser. SSL certificates prevent hackers from gaining access to, or altering your website data, and they also allow visitors to securely enter information for form fills or encrypted purchases. An SSL certificate provides trust to you and your customers. As an SSL Certificate Authority (CA), Thawte is a trusted third-party certificate issuer.

When you see a web address beginning with HTTPS, you know that site is secured by TLS/SSL encryption.
