CS2 skins can be withdrawn to your Steam inventory, sold back to the website, sent for upgrading, or even exchanged for new ones! The upgrading feature on Skin.Club allows you to enhance the value of inexpensive skins from cases to more valuable ones. This unique feature sets Skin.Club apart, as not all case opening sites offer such an option. Be sure to give it a try! How it works: Select one or more skins from your inventory Choose the skin you desire as an upgrade Click the Upgrade button The success of the upgrade is influenced by the price difference between your selected skins and the desired skin. The smaller the gap in price, the higher the probability of a successful upgrade. To withdraw CS2 skins, follow these steps: Select the desired items in your profile. Click the "Take" button. Wait for a trade offer in Steam. Accept the trade to add the skin to your inventory. It's important to note that Skin.Club does not provide cash withdrawal options. Withdrawals typically take only a few minutes since all trades are processed automatically. Provably Fair Provably Fair is an algorithm implemented by Skin.Club to demonstrate that all rolls and outcomes in case openings and other mechanics are genuinely random and remain unaltered. This assures users that there is no manipulation of the system, and every participant has an equal chance of obtaining an expensive skin from a CS2 case. With PF, predicting future outcomes is impossible; however, users can verify previous results. This approach ensures the fairness and mathematical accuracy of all results, whether they are wins or losses, and eliminates the possibility of individuals manipulating expected numbers. Skin.Club is proud to offer one of the most transparent and honest PF systems in the market. At Skin.Club, you have the ability to review the complete history of all rolls and seed changes. This feature ensures that the customization of hit probabilities for specific users is impossible. Skin.Club allows users to inspect the hits and game results of other players, confirming the authenticity of their outcomes. This transparency guarantees that other players' game results cannot be falsified. Furthermore, Skin.Club is unique in offering the ability to check the history of both client and server seeds. This data is openly available for verification by anyone at any time. Show more
