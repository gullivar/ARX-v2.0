Opening Windows to a Wider World

Samba is the most feature-rich Open Source implementation of the SMB and Active Directory protocols for Linux and UNIX-like systems.

Samba provides secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using SMB and other AD protocols such as LDAP and Kerberos.

Samba is a high-performance, scalable distributed software for providing access to various cluster filesystems. It enables cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) providers, software-defined storage (SDS) solutions, high-performance computing (HPC) applications, and enterprise-grade network attached storage (NAS) to support the latest security and SMB capabilities.

Samba is an important component to seamlessly integrate Linux/Unix Servers and Desktops into Active Directory environments. It can function either as an Active Directory Domain Controller or as a member server.

Samba is developed, maintained and supported by an active worldwide community. Development work is made possible by individuals, companies, customers and funds like the Sovereign Tech Fund.

Samba is Free Software licensed under the GNU General Public License, the Samba project is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy.
