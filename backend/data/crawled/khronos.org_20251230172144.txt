VK_EXT_present_timing: the Journey to State-of-the-Art Frame Pacing in Vulkan
     December 4, 2025  vulkan

VK_EXT_present_timing is conceptually simple yet powerful. The extension combines two fundamental features, which Vulkan devices can expose independently:

The ability to receive timing feedback about previous presentation requests
The ability to explicitly specify a target presentation time for each request


It is the combination of these features that enables applications to achieve smooth, consistent animation.

VeriSilicon’s NPU IP VIP9000NanoOi-FS has Achieved ISO 26262 ASIL B Certification Using OpenVX
     December 3, 2025  opencl, openvx    Verisilicon Holdings, Co. Ltd.

VIP9000NanoOi-FS provides hardware support for the OpenVX API and is compatible with a robust software stack and development tools, supporting OpenCL 3.0, OpenCL 1.2 Full Profile, OpenVX 1.3, OpenVX 1.2 Neural Network Extension, and extensions for OCL, OVX, and neural networks.

As part of VeriSilicon’s VIP9000 series, the VIP9000NanoOi-FS IP is designed for automotive and edge AI applications, providing high-performance neural network processing with a safety-compliant architecture. The IP supports a wide range of AI inferencing models including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with hardware-accelerated AI inference, enabling real-time applications such as object and scene detection, augmented reality, robotics, face and gesture tracking, visual inspection systems, video surveillance, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). It natively supports multiple data types and features a programmable SIMD vision pipeline, enabling high-performance execution of neural network layers while maintaining the deterministic latency required by ASIL B functional safety standards.

Igalia Optimizes Vukan to Help Valve Power Up New Steam Devices
     December 3, 2025  vulkan    Valve Corporation    Igalia, S.L.

“We implemented many Vulkan extensions and reviewed numerous others,” said Danylo Piliaiev, an engineer on the Graphics Team. “Over the years, we ensured that D3D11, D3D12, and OpenGL games rendered correctly through DXVK, vkd3d-proton, and Zink, investigating many rendering issues along the way. We achieved higher correctness than the proprietary driver and, in many cases, Mesa3D Turnip is faster as well.”
