Get Started Highly rated, easy to use “Makes expense submission easy!” “Expensify has a really easy user interface for uploading receipts and getting
                                        expense reports submitted in a timely manner. I'm also getting reimbursed in quick
                                        order as well. The best part is that their internal team checks all receipts against
                                        the log and so our CFO doesn't have to get his hands dirty to make sure the receipts
                                        line up with what I've submitted.” Dean M. “Super Easy to Use” “It's quick and easy to use as a user, trying to get reimbursed and also very easy as
                                        a manager. Looking to approve my direct reports reviews. I particularly like the
                                        ability to forward email receipts and have them auto imported into Expensify. Plus
                                        the mobile app is really easy to use.” Christy H. “Expensify helps our company to ensure compliance and accountability” “Expensify allows me to easily capture and organize my payment receipts to keep track
                                        of my travel expenditures. The user experience is excellent, and the interface is
                                        very intuitive not only in the mobile app but also in the desktop. The automated
                                        report and approval process really works and my administrative area can easily track
                                        my budget vs actual spending, ensuring compliance and accountability in my company.
                                        I love the digital receipt capture feature, it saves me time when I come back to the
                                        base.” Enrique C. “Amazing Platform!” “I really love how intuitive Expensify is to enter in my expense reports when on
                                        business trips. The bonus is how Expensify has a great app that I can use to enter
                                        my expenses in real-time instead of Monday when I get back into the office. Extra
                                        bonus tip: Expensify allows you to forward emailed receipts directly to the expense
                                        report to make things even easier!” Chris C. “Ease of use” “Their App!! I love the fact that I can quickly scan me reciepts directly from my
                                        phone. That way I never forget to add my expenses. I also like that you receive a
                                        notification when your expense has been approved or paid, it's a nice notification
                                        to get!” Naomi L. “Budgeting made easy with Expensify” “I absolutely love Expensify's new interface. It has made the process of submitting
                                        expense reports so easy and effortless! With its large, easy-to-read font and
                                        'recently used' category suggestion tool, I no longer have to go through my receipts
                                        every month. In addition, expenses can now be completed in three minutes flat -
                                        which is much faster than before, thanks to the secure gateway integrated with our
                                        company's internal web service provider, which handles all transactions between us
                                        quickly.” Megan M. “The easiest expense tool I've ever used.” “It is very very easy, as soon as you get a receipt you can scan it, the AI will
                                        capture all relevant information and it is very little interaction to get to the
                                        final sumbmission of the expense. It is so easy!!!” Luis F. “Great Program!” “Expensify has a great UI interface and is very intuitive to use. I particularly like
                                        the funcitonality of taking a picture of a receipt and having it uploaded to my
                                        account. I also like that I can send an email and the smart-scanner puts it into my
                                        expenses.” Kirsten H. “Simple, Straight-forward Expenses!” “I've never met someone that enjoys doing their expenses. Following business trips or
                                        even a few weeks in the office, the last thing that someone wants to do is take time
                                        out of their day/week to sort through, and enter receipts. Expensify makes the
                                        process easier by prompting you to auto-import expenses as you go, and their
                                        straight-forward, simple interface makes the task in the office easier than any
                                        system that I've used in the past.” Weston M. 4.5 (4,889 reviews) 45+ Integrations See All Integrations FAQ What is Expensify? Expensify is an all-in-one expense management platform. You can track every
