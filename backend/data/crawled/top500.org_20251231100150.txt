The JUPITER Booster system at the EuroHPC / Jülich Supercomputing Centre in Germany at No. 4 submitted a new measurement of 1.000 Exflop/s on the HPL benchmark. It is the fourth Exascale system on the TOP500 and the first one outside of the USA. El Capitan, Frontier, and Aurora are still leading the TOP500. All three are installed at DOE laboratories in the USA. The El Capitan system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California, USA remains the No. 1 system on the TOP500. The HPE Cray EX255a system was remeasured with 1.809 Exaflop/s on the HPL benchmark. LLNL also achieved 17.41 Petaflop/s on the HPCG benchmark which makes the system the No. 1 on this ranking as well. El Capitan has 11,340,000 cores and is based on AMD 4th generation EPYC processors with 24 cores at 1.8 GHz and AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators. It uses the Cray Slingshot 11 network for data transfer and achieves an energy efficiency of 60.9 Gigaflops/watt. read more » List Statistics TOP500 Current List 1 El Capitan - HPE Cray EX255a, AMD 4th Gen EPYC 24C 1.8GHz, AMD Instinct MI300A, Slingshot-11, TOSS, HPE 2 Frontier - HPE Cray EX235a, AMD Optimized 3rd Generation EPYC 64C 2GHz, AMD Instinct MI250X, Slingshot-11, HPE Cray OS, HPE 3 Aurora - HPE Cray EX - Intel Exascale Compute Blade, Xeon CPU Max 9470 52C 2.4GHz, Intel Data Center GPU Max, Slingshot-11, Intel 4 JUPITER Booster - BullSequana XH3000, GH Superchip 72C 3GHz, NVIDIA GH200 Superchip, Quad-Rail NVIDIA InfiniBand NDR200, RedHat Enterprise Linux, EVIDEN 5 Eagle - Microsoft NDv5, Xeon Platinum 8480C 48C 2GHz, NVIDIA H100, NVIDIA Infiniband NDR, Microsoft Azure 6 HPC6 - HPE Cray EX235a, AMD Optimized 3rd Generation EPYC 64C 2GHz, AMD Instinct MI250X, Slingshot-11, RHEL 8.9, HPE 7 Supercomputer Fugaku - Supercomputer Fugaku, A64FX 48C 2.2GHz, Tofu interconnect D, Fujitsu 8 Alps - HPE Cray EX254n, NVIDIA Grace 72C 3.1GHz, NVIDIA GH200 Superchip, Slingshot-11, HPE Cray OS, HPE 9 LUMI - HPE Cray EX235a, AMD Optimized 3rd Generation EPYC 64C 2GHz, AMD Instinct MI250X, Slingshot-11, HPE 10 Leonardo - BullSequana XH2000, Xeon Platinum 8358 32C 2.6GHz, NVIDIA A100 SXM4 64 GB, Quad-rail NVIDIA HDR100 Infiniband, EVIDEN Imprint Contact Log in or Sign up Copyright 1993-2025 TOP500.org (c)
