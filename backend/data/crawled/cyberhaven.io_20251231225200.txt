Cyberhaven combines content inspection with context from data lineage to give you smarter, faster, and easier data protection—without disrupting the business. Intro to Cyberhaven (1:40) View all customers Product categories Protect your data in the AI era, without disrupting your business. Let’s face it, traditional DLP and insider threat tools consistently disappoint. They’re clunky, generate tons of false positives, and miss modern data consumption patterns. These traditional tools were built for a world where data lived in files and a few databases. Today, data is fragmented and derivative: copied, pasted, captured in screenshots, embedded, and summarized. In the AI era, the data perimeter is broken. Cyberhaven protects data in this new reality. We reimagined DLP and insider threat from the ground up to create Data Detection and Response (DDR), combining the best capabilities of traditional data security tools in one integrated platform. The result: Cyberhaven not only outperforms each category, but is more effective than the sum of its parts. Data loss prevention Protect data with reimagined DLP built from the ground up; block leaks across email, web, cloud, and devices. Insider risk management Combine data and behavior signals to stop insider threats, clarify intent, and catch slow-burn risks. AI data security Secure AI adoption with visibility, risk assessments, and precise controls that prevent leaks without blocking teams.
