Whether you’re gathering with friends, family, or neighbors, or staying cozy at home, we could all use a laugh from time to time. Our nation is in a scary place—billionaires are raking in record profits while Americans are bearing the brunt of Donald Trump’s tariffs, stretching their paychecks to afford the essentials. On top of that, Americans are being targeted by cruel ICE raids and losing health insurance and other basic protections. This year hasn’t been easy. That’s why we created these Mad Libs to help you center laughter and rest, and spark a bit of hope for the future as we move into the new year. They’re free for you to download now!
