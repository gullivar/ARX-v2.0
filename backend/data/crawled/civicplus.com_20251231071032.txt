Drive Community Engagement After sitting here for a couple of hours going through some social media posts, trying to get this open records request solved, I [realized] — this is ridiculous, this is taking me too long. I don’t have the time to sit here and do this, so we reached back out and we ended up with a free trial [of CivicPlus Social Media Archiving software]... the rest is history. Jeff Caponera Police Chief of Grafton, WI CivicPlus has helped us improve relationships with our community members and build trust in a number of ways. First and foremost would be our town website. We’re able to keep communications and information current and accessible. Brianna Sunryd Communications Manager and Community Participation Officer Our staff and the public are so tired of having to sign in to different systems. With CivicPlus, we have a platform that offers a single log-in whether you’re signing up for alerts or watching a board meeting, and people really like that. It’s the same for staff. They log into CivicPlus through one interface and can navigate to the different tools. Melanie McDonough Lebanon, NH Chief Innovation Officer With limited resources, we’re trying to get the most value from our staff and available funds. The combination of maps, data, service requests and work orders offers us the foundation to make the best decision.
