The granular detail provided by GPTZero allows administrators to observe AI usage across the institution. This data is helping guide us on what type of education, parameters, and policies need to be in place to promote an innovative and healthy use of AI.

After talking to the class, each student we compiled with GPTZero as possibly using AI ended up telling us they did, which made us extremely confident in GPTZero’s capabilities.

Sign up for GPTZero. Its feedback aligns well with my sense of what is going on in the writing - almost line-for-line.

I'm a huge fan of the writing reports that let me verify my documents are human-written. The writing video, in particular, is a great way to visualize the writing process!

FAQs about GPTZero

Everything you need to know about GPTZero and our ChatGPT detector.

Can’t find an answer? You can talk to our customer service team.

What is GPTZero?

GPTZero is the first and leading AI detector that allows you to identify specific content in a document or text that has been generated by a large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT. Founded in January 2023, GPTZero has served over 10 million users to date and works with 100+ organizations in education, hiring, publishing, legal and more.

How does AI detection work?

AI detectors work by looking for patterns in text that are more likely to have been written by a machine than a human. The most common factors they look for include: Perplexity: Is the writing obviously predictable? Burstiness: How much variation is there in the sentence length and style? Style: Is the tone and writing style overly generic or repetitive? GPTZero uses its own proprietary model that takes hundreds of factors into consideration and boasts the highest detection accuracy in the industry

Is GPTZero’s AI detector accurate?

Yes. Independent benchmarks, like our partners at Penn State's AI Research Lab, and our own large-scale testing show that GPTZero is the most accurate AI detector, with a 99% accuracy rate when spotting AI-generated text vs. human writing. This means we correctly classify AI writing 99 out of 100 times and keep misclassification of text to an absolute minimum. Our results were further validated on RAID, a comprehensive, third-party benchmark where GPTZero was shown to be the most accurate AI detector in North America, detecting 95.7% of AI texts while only incorrectly predicting 1% of human texts as AI, an accuracy that jumps to over 99% when filtering to modern LLMs like GPT4. Unlike many competitors, GPTZero can reliably detect "mixed documents" (where human and AI writing are combined) with a 96.5% accuracy rate. While no AI detector can ever truly be 100% perfect, we are committed to being a leader in responsible adoption of AI generation and AI detection technologies.

How do I use GPTZero’s AI detection tool?

You can start using GPTZero straight away in 3 easy steps: Paste Text or Upload Document: Paste in raw text or upload your file for review and press ‘Scan’. For scans over 10,000 characters, create a free account first. See Your Results: GPTZero will suggest what percentage of your text is likely to be AI-generated and highlight the specific phrases it has detected. Download our Chrome Extension for Google Docs and web: View AI detection and typing pattern metrics on any page, allowing you to spot AI-created content with ease.

Who is GPTZero for?

GPTZero is the most trusted AI content checker in education, both for teachers and students who use GPTZero to guide conversations on academic integrity and writing improvement. GPTZero is used in over 3500 colleges and 100s of institutions. We also serve publishers, recruiters, copy-writers, marketers and businesses where authentic and quality writing truly matters.

Does the GPTZero AI Content Checker only detect ChatGPT outputs?

No. GPTZero works across a wide range of AI language models, including but not limited to ChatGPT, GPT-5, GPT-4, GPT-3, Gemini, Claude, Llama, Deepseek, and AI services based on those models. Our detector is designed for the highest accuracy rate regardless of which model may have produced the text. In our latest model release, we’ve updated the majority of our training data, including more AI documents from: OpenAI – GPT4.1,GPT4.1-mini, o3, o3-mini Gemini – 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Flash-Lite Claude, Sonnet 4 as well as a few other models.

Which languages does GPTZero support?

GPTZero fully supports English, German, Portuguese, French and Spanish with industry-leading accuracy. We are also constantly used in many other languages and in over 100 countries.

What is the best AI detector?

GPTZero is consistently rated the most accurate and reliable AI detector across various use cases. Reliability: In 2025, G2 ranked GPTZero the #1 most trusted and reliable AI tool, above Grammarly. Accuracy: GPTZero is the most accurate AI detector with 99% accuracy rates across diverse datasets, independently reviewed by AI labs at top institutions. Independent reviewers, including Tom’s Guide, testing all popular detectors named GPTZero the most accurate. Best Interpretability: GPTZero is the only detector that explains exactly why text is AI with natural language. GPTZero also has the most accurate sentence-level AI detection, with color-coded highlights on exactly where AI is used in an essay.

What are the limitations of AI Detectors?

No AI detector is 100% accurate, and AI itself is changing constantly. Results should not be used to punish or as the final verdict. Accuracy improves with longer inputs (document-level results are stronger than paragraph or sentence-level) and is strongest on English prose. GPTZero is the only AI detector de-biased for ESL (English Second Language) learners, which many competitors do not take into account. We repeatedly train our model to reduce false positive rate for ESL writing to 1%. We also monitor our datasets to transparently prevent any bias in AI detection training data.
