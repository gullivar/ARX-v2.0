@nerdburn

It’s fun, feels lightweight, and really quick to spin up user auth and a few tables. Almost too easy! Highly recommend.

@patrickc

Very impressed by @supabase's growth. For new startups, they seem to have gone from "promising" to "standard" in remarkably short order.

@Aliahsan_sfv

Okay, I finally tried Supabase today and wow... why did I wait so long? 😅 Went from 'how do I even start' to having auth + database + real-time updates working in like 20 minutes. Sometimes the hype is actually justified! #Supabase

@yatsiv_yuriy

Supabase is the best product experience I've had in years.
Not just tech - taste.
From docs to latency to the URL structure that makes you think "oh, that's obvious"
Feels like every other platform should study how they built it
@supabase I love you

@adeelibr

@supabase shout out, their MCP is awesome. It's helping me create better row securities and telling me best practises for setting up a supabase app

@TyronBache

Really impressed with @supabase's Assistant.

It has helped me troubleshoot and solve complex CORS Configuration issues on Pinger.

@MinimEditor

I’ve always used Supabase just as a database.

Yesterday, I helped debug a founder’s vibe-coding project built with React + React Router — no backend server.
The “backend” was entirely Supabase Edge Functions as the API.
First time using Supabase this way.
Impressive.

@orlandopedro_

Love @supabase custom domains

makes the auth so much better

@sdusteric

Loving #Supabase MCP. Claude Code would not only plan what data we should save but also figure out a migration script by checking what the schema looks like on Supabase via MCP.

@SteinlageScott

I love @supabase's built-in Advisors. The security and performance linters improve everything and boost my confidence in what I'm building!

@BowTiedQilin

Working with @supabase has been one of the best dev experiences I've had lately.

Incredibly easy to set up, great documentation, and so many fewer hoops to jump through than the competition.

I definitely plan to use it on any and all future projects.

@adm_lawson

Love supabse edge functions. Cursor+Supabase+MCP+Docker desktop is all I need

@gokul_i

First time running @supabase in local. It just works. Very good DX imo.

@dadooos_

Run supabase locally and just wow in silence! I am impressed! This is the kind of tooling I would want for my team.

@Rodrigo66799141

After a week of diving deep into Supabase for my new SaaS project, I'm really impressed with its Auth and RLS features. It makes security much simpler for solo founders. #buildinpublic #SaaS

@xthemadgeniusx

Lately been using Supabase over AWS/ GCP for products to save on costs and rapid builds(Vibe Code) that do not need all the Infra and the hefty costs that come with AWS/ GCP out the door. Great solution overall.

@pontusab

I love everything about Supabase.

@viratt_mankali

Love how Supabase makes full stack features this easy. Using it with Next.js and loving the experience!
