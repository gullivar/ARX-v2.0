     dampening data from route-views3.route-views.org ( to August 2012 ) The collector script that gathers the Cisco data was writted by Sean Mccreary. Note: MRT RIB and UPDATE files have internal timestamps in
the standard Unix format, however the file names are constructed
based on the time zone setting of the collector. The collectors
had their time zones set to Pacific Time prior to Feb 3, 2003 at
approximately 19:00 UTC. At that time all but one of the existing
collectors had their time zones reset to UTC. The one exception
was routeviews.eqix which was not reset to UTC until Feb 1, 2006
at approximately 21:00 UTC.
