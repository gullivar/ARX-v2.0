Why our customers love us

We’ve been using TrustArc daily, and it’s been a fantastic experience from the start. It’s incredibly easy to use and was super simple to integrate into our existing systems. The customer service is outstanding—truly the best I’ve ever had from any software vendor. This is, without a doubt, one of the best-in-class privacy and data management solutions available. The AI capabilities are particularly impressive and feel like they’re ahead of the curve in the industry.

-Kevin Alvero, Integral Ad Science, Chief Compliance Officer

We switched to TrustArc from OneTrust because of poor support and an inability to get their cookie tool working on our site. Working with TrustArc has, quite literally, been exactly as we hoped. Our Technical Account Manager has been a big part of our success.

– Sean McInnis, Data Protection Officer, NEJM Group

Implementation was a breeze. The team has guided us through the process. In addition, and probably more importantly, the support team has been available at the beginning and for follow-up throughout the year.

– Brian K.

TrustArc is essential in helping my company navigate the complex landscape of data privacy.

– Gunhan P., Sr. Legal Counsel, Forte Labs

TrustArc has been extremely helpful in getting us set up to be compliant with a number of privacy and other applicable laws. Further, the customer team we are working with who provide implementation support are incredible and we couldn’t ask for a better team.

– Jacob G., Associate General Counsel, Redis
