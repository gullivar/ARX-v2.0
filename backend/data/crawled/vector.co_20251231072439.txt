Turn your contact-level insights into ready-to-run ad audiences. Compare our plans Frequently asked questions What is contact-based advertising? It’s advertising built for how B2B buyers actually behave. Instead of targeting anonymous visitors or whole accounts, contact-based ads reach real people verified contacts who match your ICP and are already engaging with your brand. How is this different from retargeting? Retargeting chases anyone who’s been to your site. ‍ Contact-based advertising focuses only on known, qualified contacts — using real names, titles, and companies, so you spend less on noise and more on buyers who matter. Where can I run contact-based ads? Everywhere your audience is. Vector connects your contact data to LinkedIn, Google, Meta, and other major ad platforms so your targeting stays consistent across channels. How does Vector know who to target? Vector sees who’s engaging with your brand on your site, in your ads, and across the web and matches that activity to verified contacts from your CRM and data partners. So your audiences always reflect what’s actually happening, not a static list. Build ad audiences from real people that visit your site, click your ads, and research your competitors.
