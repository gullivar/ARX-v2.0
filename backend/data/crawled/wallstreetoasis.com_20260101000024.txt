Real Results. Hear how our alumni used the program to get amazing outcomes Coming from Case Western, I wasn't a finance major, but WSO Academy was a game-changer . I went from sending 50 emails a month to 1,200 in two months using their automation tools . The mentors helped me totally nail interviews, even for restructuring, leading to my Morgan Stanley IB offer . Definitely worth it! Class of '26 Jacob Seed Q4 2023 Cohort I got Spring Weeks at Goldman and PJT , then a middle market PE internship in NYC. Recruiting from Singapore was tough, but WSO mentors, especially Cindy, helped me figure out what I really wanted and how to prep for interviews that used to scare me . Class of '26 Julia Seryakova Q3 2023 Cohort Starting early was key. I began networking freshman year even when it felt awkward . My Aggie network was huge and mock interviews made me sharp. Lazard really cared about my behaviorals and who I was. Have a life outside studying... they want the whole you. Class of '26 Connor Pieprzyca Q3 2024 Cohort I started VERY late at Oxford, literally missing spring weeks ! But WSO Academy got me started. I did, like, twenty-five calls a week... networking was key, even in the UK . This, plus deep prep, helped me land a private equity role straight out of biochem. Don't limit yourself. Class of '26 Ralph Gibson Q2 2024 Cohort As an international student and former varsity soccer player, I started with a blank slate —no accounting class, no playbook. WSO’s structure and mentor network turned chaos into a plan . Repetitions on storytelling and case prep built the muscle I needed to push through rejections and ultimately earn my BCG offer. Class of '26 Luis Estrella Q3 2023 Cohort I came in late, my resume was a mess , and I wasn’t sure I was ready. WSO Academy got me on track fast. They cleaned up my resume, drilled me on technicals, and helped me break into IB with a boutique, then land Wells Fargo. Super helpful mentors who really knew their stuff. Class of '26 Aryn Chadha Q4 2023 Cohort I already had an offer , but I didn't want to be stuck in oil & gas. Plus, breaking into NYC from Rice was tough :) WSO Academy really helped me refine my 'why' for New York and ace my behavioral interviews. Their courses also prepped me for my Excel Olympics win! I landed Jefferies Power full-time in NYC. Class of '25 Taylor Griffeth Q3 2023 Cohort Breaking into finance as a liberal arts international student at Kenyon felt impossible. My resume was a mess, and I was totally lost. But WSO Academy swooped in... I ramped up networking like crazy (150+ calls!) and their mentors helped me nail my mocks. That preparation led to 3 superdays and my Morgan Stanley offer. Class of '27 Aishik Biswas Q3 2024 Cohort As a Colby freshman, I had no direction despite wanting finance. WSO Academy gave me a detailed plan and framework . I was doing three to five calls daily and even visited NYC banks in person, which was a huge differentiator. They helped me land a private equity internship and Bank of America IBD . Class of '26 Ryan Stewart Q3 2023 Cohort This testimonial is currently in production. If you are accepted to WSO Academy and would like to speak with this Stanford student prior to enrolling, we are happy to arrange that call. Class of '25 Coming Soon Q1 2024 Cohort This testimonial is currently in production. If you are accepted to WSO Academy and would like to speak with this Stanford student prior to enrolling, we are happy to arrange that call. I knew I wanted real estate, but Academy helped me tell that story better. I talked to mentors like Teru and Nick, downloaded the modeling templates, and studied the macro stuff. It gave me a real edge in interviews . That’s how I ended up at Blackstone Real Estate full time. Class of '25 Daryl Eng Q3 2024 Cohort I was super demotivated after club rejections . Fast forward after joining WSO, I sent 412 cold emails, getting 60 coffee chats thanks to them and my polished resume. I faced nine brutal first rounds and four superdays in one week , totally slammed! But Academy prepped me, leading to my BMO offer. Class of '27 Devin Chauhan Q4 2024 Cohort I came into recruiting super late, well past the usual timelines, and I wasn’t part of any finance clubs. WSO Academy gave me a proven process and the mentorship I needed, from learning what restructuring even was to building an outreach strategy that landed me 50+ coffee chats. That preparation helped me break into Greenhill Restructuring in New York. Q1 2024 Cohort Emily Zhang Class of '25 At Villanova I felt behind, competing with Ivy League kids and lacking real finance experience. WSO Academy’s mentors and bootcamps sharpened my technicals and taught me to network effectively. I went all in (sometimes skipping class for calls) and that persistence helped me land Evercore . Class of '27 Madhav Lopez Q4 2024 Cohort I was getting to final rounds at top quant shops , but just couldn’t quite land the offer . The Academy really made a difference, especially the quant mentors. Mocks with John and Jeremy were critical... they helped me with everything from brainteasers to my story. I went from rejections to an landing offer in the quant ISG group at Goldman . By the end, interviews were actually fun. Class of '26 Zachary Smuckler Q3 2024 Cohort I was a biochem major, totally missed US recruiting timelines , and felt no way to get into IB, so I joined WSO Academy and their mentors prepped me non-stop for interviews. The support and resources helped me land a six-month Morgan Stanley IB internship in Hong Kong and full-time IB offer in the US. Class of '24 Merton Li Q3 2023 Cohort Coming from audit in South Africa, I knew breaking into M&A in London wasn’t going to be easy. Recruiters wouldn’t even take my calls . But I wasn’t ready to just settle and “go into industry”. Thanks to the WSO Academy push, I started landing 15-20 networking calls a week. One of my earliest chats led to a buy-side analyst offer at PCB Partners. Took four months, but it changed my career . Class of '21 Luca Ferri Q3 2024 Cohort I started super late at Carnegie Mellon, and networking felt like a huge uphill battle . Bank offers weren't converting... I even got ghosted for a month! But WSO Academy changed everything. Their mentors nailed my PE mocks, helping me land my dream software private equity internship . Couldn't have done it without them! Class of '27 Charles Lin Q4 2024 Cohort I went to culinary school before Brown - not the typical finance path . I started prepping early, and probably did 50-60 informational interviews. Never begged for referrals, just connected with people over stuff like cooking or school. WSO helped tighten up my resume and mock interviews , and that made a difference. Got offers at places like Morgan Stanley and a bunch of others. Class of '27 Nicholas Lam Q3 2024 Cohort I started as a total blank slate at UC Irvine, but WSO Academy transformed everything.

Class of '27 Tej Thakur Q2 2024 Cohort I had seven years post-MBA in FP&A and consulting but felt stuck. I didn’t know how to pitch myself for banking .

It helped me finally land an associate IB role at Morgan Stanley (the only candidate that received an offer that wasn't currently in an MBA program) Class of '10 Julie Wang Q1 2024 Cohort Was late, nontraditional, and unsure if WSO could help in the Middle East . Turns out they had mentors in UAE, Qatar, even other GCC countries. I got help on everything from financial modeling to behavioral prep. This made it possible to break into banking at one of Doha’s top firms. Class of '26 Ali Maksudkhonov Q3 2023 Cohort Transferring schools, adjusting to Cornell, and juggling clubs, classes, and recruiting felt intense . I had zero Cornell alum connections. WSO Academy gave me structure, mentors, and mock support that helped me crush interviews. I stacked four off-cycle internships and landed UBS . Class of '27 Maxwell Guan Q2 2024 Cohort I was stuck in back-office risk. Getting into finance late at McMaster felt like a battle, and my networking for top roles was just not cutting it. The mentors helped me nail my story and authentically brand myself for private equity and helped me land at CPPIB! Class of '24 Jash Mehta Q4 2024 Cohort Came to Princeton as a student athlete recruited for softball. Didn’t think about careers until midway through sophomore year. Joined the Academy in January super late . Had barely ten calls done, within weeks I was doing 20 a week. The prep really helped , and I eventually landed an offer at UBS . Class of '27 Allie Goodwin Q1 2025 Cohort Before WSO I barely knew what IB was. I cold-called FP&A folks just to get reps. Once I joined, I had real feedback from mentors and a clear roadmap. Did a year at a boutique, made ~200 calls, and finally broke into a bulge bracket in New York. Class of '23 Alejandro Sanchez Q3 2023 Cohort I was a sophomore, an athlete at Tufts, but felt unprepared for banking; I even missed the freshman accelerator! WSO Academy became my backbone . They gave me the roadmap and networking templates. I had sixty coffee chats and eleven first rounds, leading to my Barclays offer . Class of '26 Declan Murphy Q3 2023 Cohort Didn’t know about high finance at Auburn. After two years in FP&A, I wanted something faster paced . WSO Academy helped me get there. I leaned on the technical courses, resume review, and strategy sessions with mentors. My first interview led to an offer. It was the perfect next step. Class of '21 Jordan Christie Q1 2023 Cohort As an engineering major, I was doing back-office tech, and didn't know how to break into front office M&A. WSO Academy totally changed my view! Their bootcamps and IB interview prep were awesome for technicals. Plus, their mentors helped me craft an incredible story, making me competitive against finance majors. Class of '25 Alex Wever Q4 2024 Cohort Joining WSO Academy right before sophomore year was pivotal , even though I was nervous. Those hundreds of emails and countless mock interviews really sharpened me . It felt risky letting an early offer go, but trusting that intensive prep ultimately led me to a bulge bracket. It was quite a journey. Class of '27 Andrew Noah Q3 2024 Cohort I came from a languages background in Italy and knew nothing about finance . WSO Academy helped me ramp up fast. I was connecting with twenty people a day on LinkedIn, learning a ton, and the bootcamps really built my foundation . That prep helped me land KPMG Deal Advisory and a top Master’s. Class of '24 Jack O'Shea Scanlan Q4 2024 Cohort Freshman year sucked . I got rejected from 10+ clubs, had no clue how to prep, and my technicals were rough. WSO Academy helped me improve a lot, so I could hit the ground running. They fixed my resume, crushed the mocks, and landed 3 first rounds. Ended up getting Blair. Wouldn’t have happened without WSO. Class of '27 Andrew Lin Q4 2024 Cohort After losing my job at a family office, I felt stuck and frustrated . WSO Academy gave me structure, accountability, and confidence. I completely revamped my outreach, spoke with over 60 professionals, and landed a consulting role at A&M. It honestly changed everything for me during a really tough time. Class of '15 SJ Katyal Q1 2024 Cohort After my master’s, interviews basically stopped in January. I’d never networked and my CV read like a CS lab report. WSO mentors helped me revamp my CV and practice real outreach. Calls picked up again and I landed a quant research role . Simple as that. Class of '25 Pranam Hegde Q1 2025 Cohort My GPA from UofT engineering wasn’t great , and I knew my technicals were weak. WSO Academy changed my approach.  Alex helped me clean up my resume, the courses and mocks seriously leveled me up , and I just kept networking. After a long wait… got the offer from Scotia Capital! Class of '28 Aditya Mishra Q2 2024 Cohort WSO taught me how to tell my story . Once that clicked, conversations felt natural and interviews stopped feeling like guesswork.

Class of '27 Coming Soon Q4 2024 Cohort This testimonial is currently in production. If you are accepted to WSO Academy and would like to speak with this Stony Brook student prior to enrolling, we are happy to arrange that call.
