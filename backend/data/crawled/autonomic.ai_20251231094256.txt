Home - Autonomic Welcome Autonomic was founded in 2016 and acquired by Ford Motor Company in 2018 as a fully-owned independent subsidiary. In 2023,
                  Autonomic became fully integrated with Ford Motor Company. What is the TMC? The Transportation Mobility Cloud (TMC) is one of the largest
                connected vehicle cloud platforms in production. Autonomic built
                the TMC so developers could revolutionize the vehicle ownership
                experience. With its API-driven design, the TMC simplifies how
                applications interact with vehicles by abstracting away the
                complexities of communicating with different vehicle models and
                connectivity devices. A platform that enables innovation. Simply. © 2023 Autonomic, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices
