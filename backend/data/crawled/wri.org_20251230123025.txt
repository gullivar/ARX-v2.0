To enable progress at the pace and scale needed, we also work to shift the economic, finance and governance structures that shape people’s decisions and behaviors. Learn more about our focus areas:

Our Global Reach

While WRI’s 2,000+ staff support initiatives around the globe, many of our efforts are concentrated in countries with the most potential to unlock global transformation. These focus countries house many of the world’s most vulnerable people, contain vitally important natural landscapes and produce significant greenhouse gas emissions — or will in the coming years. We have country offices in Brazil, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Rwanda and the United States, as well as regional offices in Africa and Europe. We work with partners in more than 50 nations.
