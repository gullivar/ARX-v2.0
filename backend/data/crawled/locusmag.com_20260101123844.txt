September 2025. Stephen Baxter’s science fiction has often taken a big idea, with some grounding in speculative science, and used it as the launchpad for exploring human interactions. Think of Flood (2008), where the Earth is indundated not because of climate change but because subterranean reservoirs are breached. In Hearthspace , the initiating idea is the possibility of dark-matter stars. Imagining that such …Read More Helm by Sarah Hall: Review by Niall Harrison December 31, 2025 Helm , Sarah Hall (Faber & Faber UK 978-0-5713-8355-9, £20.00, 368pp, hc) August 2025. (Mariner 978-0-063-43994-8, $30.00, 368pp, hc) November 2025. It may be that Sarah Hall’s new novel peaks with its first chapter, but I wouldn’t change it.

Bellwether College is a floating structure somewhere in the Baltic Sea. In the future that has followed the Crash, most technology is lost or dangerous, and the ghosts of electronic information wander in search of their lost sources, infecting and fatally transforming anyone luckless enough to come in contact with them. Environmental degradation has rendered weather patterns and …Read More Halcyon Years by Alastair Reynolds: Review by Russell Letson December 30, 2025 Halcyon Years , Alastair Reynolds, (Gollancz 978-1-3996-1176-3, £25.00, 326 pp, hc) October 2025. Alastair Reynolds is known, quite properly, for work that tends toward widescreen space adventure and exploration, posthumanity, and cosmology operatics – the worlds of the Revelation Space , House of Suns , Revenger , or Blue Remembered Earth sequences. But he is also a genre adventurer, fond of embedding, say, pirate stories or police procedurals or family sagas in his …Read More New Titles & Bestsellers View All Bestsellers New Titles & Bestsellers Weekly Bestsellers, 29 December 2025 December 30, 2025 LocEditor 0 Bestsellers New Titles & Bestsellers Weekly Bestsellers, 22 December 2025 December 30, 2025 LocEditor 0 New Books New Book Releases: December 30, 2025 December 30, 2025 locusmag 0 New Titles & Bestsellers Magazines Received – November December 30, 2025 locusmag 0 Roundtable & More View All Saga Publishes Novel Co-Written by Clippy April 1, 2025 Premee Mohamed Guest Post March 7, 2025 Sophie Haeder Guest Post–“From Dice to Pen: How Tabletop Roleplaying Games Are Fuelling a New Wave of Fantasy Writing” January 8, 2025 Roshani Chokshi and Niv Sekar: Guest Post August 27, 2024 Beyond the Mag: Vlogs & More!
