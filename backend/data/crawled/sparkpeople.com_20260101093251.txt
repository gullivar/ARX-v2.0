SparkAmerica is a national movement and fitness challenge, where you can compete with cities across the nation, work toward personal growth and even win prizes!

More About SparkPeople Closing

We want to thank you for inviting us to be a part of your journey and for the privilege of earning your support and enthusiasm for the brand. SparkPeople's business model has always been free and was driven by advertiser support, a model that became difficult to maintain in recent years. With many larger technology companies emerging in the health and fitness space, we struggled to compete for the same advertising dollars that would keep the site online and alive. Unfortunately, it costs many millions of dollars per year to run SparkPeople, and the burden eventually became too much.

SparkAmerica is part of our new business model, in which we work with companies and organizations to help keep their employees healthy with PeopleOne Health. Not only does this business model allow us to expand our health offerings to more people, but it also does a much better job of paying the bills and will likely allow us to hire more people over time to keep improving our tech offerings. We're very excited that we can open up our website and app for this business while keeping it free to help all individuals and organizations in the United States achieve their health and fitness goals.
