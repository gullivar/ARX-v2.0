Parkiter
Join the revolution

A smart landing page for greater revenue.

By adopting an analytic driven approach to design, Parkiter is revolutionising the domain parking page. The traditional Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertisements have been replaced by links that if clicked, trigger a real-time auction. Thousands of advertisers then compete for this highly targeted traffic and the user is then routed to the winning bidder within milliseconds.

This is an ideal solution for monetizing domain traffic that is one hundred percent ICANN compliant for registrars while producing outstanding results for domain investments.
