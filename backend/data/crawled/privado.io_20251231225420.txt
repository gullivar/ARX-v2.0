Get PrivadoVPN Real Protection, Real Stories User Reviews Expert Reviews Great app, easily manageable and well setup. New features improved quite a bit. Possible Improvements, app shortcuts. Some apps no longer work through the shortcut with new version, when previously worked.. Protection is key and Privado provides that! Edit: version 3.33, new update has now improved with app shortcut!! - Joe D Excellent, works, no limits, no Ads. Unbelievable! - Alex Zotov easy to use. great speed and service - Nol Malone Must admit this VPN has been like a breath of fresh air with the crowded players in the privacy market. Their Free service compelled me to try the premium version so far their server speeds have been quite fast though not quicker than their well established peers. 30 day money back guarantee is a plus. Their wireguard protocol (recent implementation) is an added bonus. A must have in my opinion to keep your data safe online + they own most of their servers (physical based) & not virtual. - Pritesh-EPM So far so good! Only been two days! But I will update in the future as time goes on. Using it on my Nvidia Shield Pro android & Samsung S20+ here in Canada 🇨🇦 Both apps for my devices work smoothly! Nice simple Clean UI & easy to navigate settings for you to choose as you set up your locations & Protocols & so on! This review is for the Premium paid version. Sign up & paying was a breeze took me like 5 mins! And the holiday day special offer was a no-brainer 5 star service!!! 😎🥳 - Nick Capone I really like how secure this VPN is compared to the other ones I’ve tried over the years. The app is pretty simple and it helps keep my downloads safe. Overall, it’s great for the price and helps me get the extra protection I need. - J M While the essentials are there, such as a kill switch and split tunneling, what sets PrivadoVPN apart is free SOCKS5 proxies as part of your subscription. There’s definitely much to like here, and I’m particularly impressed with PrivadoVPN’s speed results as well as its pleasing UI. - TechRadar PrivadoVPN provides a consistent and straightforward experience for everyday use, particularly for those who value simplicity. - Top10VPN PrivadoVPN’s free plan is an excellent choice for casual VPN users. - CNet It’s tough to find a better free VPN, and Privado’s premium service is no slouch either. It’s one of the only VPNs with free servers in Brazil, and it’s faster than most other free providers. The premium plan takes away its data and device connection limits, which makes it a formidable VPN for streaming too. - vpnMentor PrivadoVPN is a powerful player in the world of unblocking and comes packing pretty decent speeds to back that up. - Tom’s Guide It’s fast, consistent, and secure, and most importantly, it works. - security.org Built for Real-World VPN Use Cases PrivadoVPN Total Online Security adapts to your lifestyle, whether you're managing work on public networks, securing your family’s devices, or browsing privately at home.
