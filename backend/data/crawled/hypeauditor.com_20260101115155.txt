The audience overlap insights are especially valuable – they helped us uncover new partnership opportunities, even leading to collaborations with brands we wouldn’t have considered otherwise. Plus, the platform makes it easy to spot fake followers and assess content performance, so we can be confident we’re working with the right creators using the best influencer marketing tools. ‌ Chang Ying Hsieh Marketing Section Manager  “Building an influencer list for Black Friday was a breeze.” HypeAuditor made it easy to build a high-quality influencer list for MediaMarkt’s massive Black Friday influencer marketing campaign. The Discovery tool helped us quickly find creators with the right audience demographics, and the detailed analytics let us filter out low-quality influencers with fake followers. The white-label reporting feature also helped us present polished, professional campaign results to our client – which is essential for an influencer marketing company like ours. ‌ Engin Yurdakul Founder (for MediaMarkt) “Influencer discovery and analysis was a game-changer.” Running influencer marketing campaigns as a small startup can be overwhelming – especially when managing everything manually. For us, automating influencer discovery and analysis with HypeAuditor’s influencer marketing platform was a game changer. Instead of spending hours evaluating profiles, we quickly identified relevant travel influencers, checked audience authenticity, and tracked key metrics like engagement rates. This efficiency meant we could stretch our budget, build meaningful influencer collaborations, and double our Instagram engagement. ‌ Negin Rostampour Social Media Manager  “Managing multi-market campaigns is so much easier now.” Working with multiple markets means we need an influencer marketing tool that’s fast and reliable. HypeAuditor helps us discover influencers from different countries, filter out low-quality accounts, and analyze audience authenticity in detail. For the Migros campaign, we found 19 relevant influencers and tracked the campaign’s performance with detailed, white-label reporting tools. The platform made it easy to present clear, data-driven results – including engagement rates, audience insights, and earned media value. ‌ Engin Yurdakul Founder (for Migros) “We found local creators and skyrocketed app downloads.” HypeAuditor has been a game-changer for our influencer search. The Discovery tool helped us find local creators who resonate with our Gen Z audience, while demographic filters made it easy to narrow down potential collaborators. We’ve also discovered rising stars through the Top Trending feature and verified their engagement and authenticity. The Campaign Management tool saved us a lot of time, helping us smoothly manage nationwide influencer marketing campaigns. Thanks to HypeAuditor, we’ve seen significant growth in app downloads. ‌ Marion Vrignaud Head of Marketing & Communication “Verifying influencer authenticity is simple.” Before using HypeAuditor, we struggled with verifying influencer authenticity and audience quality, which led to wasted time and ineffective campaigns. Now, with the Influencer Analytics tool, we can easily check an influencer's profile for key data like engagement and audience demographics, without the guesswork. It’s been a game-changer for our influencer marketing efforts, allowing us to focus our efforts on the right influencers and make better use of our marketing budget. ‌ Eva Martorell Moreno Marketing Communication Manager “Our go-to platform for global campaigns.” For us, working with social media influencers who have real followers is a top priority. That’s why we chose HypeAuditor – its ability to provide accurate data on audience quality and engagement is invaluable. Over the years, we've used their influencer marketing platform to efficiently discover, analyze, and recruit influencers across multiple countries. The Campaign Management and Reporting features have been a huge help in demonstrating campaign success to our partners, allowing us to track key metrics like reach, engagement, and ROI. ‌ ‌ Zuzana Chmelová and Radek Šimík Influencer Relations Managers “Audience insights kept our brand image strong.” HypeAuditor has been an invaluable influencer management solution for us in identifying influencers who align with our brand’s luxury image and engage authentically with their audience. The platform’s audience insights and fraud detection tools have helped us maintain campaign credibility and efficiency across our global properties. One standout influencer campaign reached over half a million users with excellent engagement. I think it's fair to say HypeAuditor has been a very reliable influencer marketing tool in being able to narrow down audiences of influencers that we’re targeting across the world. ‌ James Karuga Associate Director “We scaled to 17,000 athlete profiles with HypeAuditor’s data.” At Total Player Value, gathering accurate data on thousands of college athletes was a challenge, especially with most athletes being nano-influencers. HypeAuditor’s API helped us streamline data collection and benchmarking, allowing us to quickly pull key metrics like engagement rates and audience sizes. Now, we’ve built profiles for over 17,000 athletes and are on track to reach 40,000. The benchmarking feature helps athletes understand their performance and value, making it easier for them to monetize their social media presence. ‌ Jeff Cravens CEO “Our influencer marketing strategy transformed overnight.” In the past year, Moon Magic spent a lot of time manually analyzing influencer profiles and gathering data. But once we found HypeAuditor, it saved us so much time. We now have easy access to detailed metrics like engagement rates, audience authenticity, and influencer profiles – all in one influencer management software. We’ve been able to expand our influencer marketing strategy, build relationships with proven influencers, and save time on reporting. The automated reports and influencer tracking tools have made our work so much easier. ‌ Flora Macher Influencer Relations Manager “HypeAuditor helped us uncover new partnerships.” HypeAuditor helps us quickly analyze competitors, discover high-potential influencers, and back our proposals with real influencer marketing data.
