        step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system,
        entirely from source code. Currently, the Linux From Scratch organization consists of the following
        subprojects: LFS :: Linux From Scratch is the main book, the
       base from which all other projects are derived. BLFS :: Beyond Linux From Scratch helps you
       extend your finished LFS installation into a more customized and usable
       system. ALFS :: Automated Linux From Scratch provides
       tools for automating and managing LFS and BLFS builds. MLFS :: Multilib Linux From Scratch is a variant
       of LFS which sets up an LFS system that is able to build and execute
       32-bit binaries. GLFS :: Gaming Linux From Scratch is based on 
       BLFS and helps you install gaming support software like Steam or Wine
       on a new LFS or MLFS system. SLFS :: Supplemental Linux From Scratch
       supplements an LFS installation beyond BLFS. Hints :: The Hints project is a collection of
       documents that explain how to enhance your LFS system in ways that are
       not included in the LFS or BLFS books. Patches :: The Patches project serves as a
       central repository for all patches useful to an LFS user. LFS Editor's Guide :: A document that 
       describes the LFS development process. Museum :: Copies of ancient LFS and BLFS versions. © 1998-2025 Gerard Beekmans. Website design by Jeremy Huntwork &
