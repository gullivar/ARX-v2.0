enhanced version of the Nginx core, our enhanced version of LuaJIT , many carefully written Lua
libraries, lots of high quality 3rd-party Nginx modules , and
most of their external dependencies. It is designed to help developers easily
build scalable web applications, web services, and dynamic web gateways. By taking advantage of various well-designed Nginx modules (most
of which are developed by the OpenResty team themselves), OpenResty ® effectively
turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web developers
can use the Lua programming language to script various existing nginx C modules
and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance web applications that
are capable to handle 10K ~ 1000K+ connections in a single box. OpenResty ® aims to run your server-side web app completely in the Nginx server,
leveraging Nginx 's event model to do non-blocking I/O not only
with the HTTP clients, but also with remote backends like MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Memcached, and Redis. Real-world applications of OpenResty ® range from dynamic web portals and web
gateways, web application firewalls, web service platforms for mobile
apps/advertising/distributed storage/data analytics,
to full-fledged dynamic web applications and web sites. The hardware used to
run OpenResty ® also ranges from very big metals to embedded devices with very
limited resources. It is not uncommon for our production users to serve billions
of requests daily for millions of active users with just a handful of machines. OpenResty ® is not an Nginx fork. It is a higher
level application and gateway platform using Nginx as a component.
Most of the patches applied to the Nginx core in OpenResty ® have
already been submitted to the official Nginx team and most of
the patches submitted have also been accepted. We constantly import the latest
features and bug fixes from the official Nginx team, the official LuaJIT repository, and other sources. See Components for the complete list of software bundled
in OpenResty ® . See GettingStarted on how to quickly setup an OpenResty ® server that can say hello world over HTTP. Or you can go to the Download section
to grab OpenResty ® 's source code tarball directly. We provide free technical support through the community on the openresty and openresty-en mailing
lists. See Community . Our OpenResty Inc. company offers enterprise solutions based on OpenResty
to its global customers, with commercial support.
