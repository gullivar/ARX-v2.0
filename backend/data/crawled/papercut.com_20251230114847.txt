Printing should be waste-free, easy, and secure...

DO YOU FIND PRINTING HARD?

Easily print from any device, anytime

Printing is a boring part of IT because it should be – it should “just work”.

 

PaperCut empowers you to make printing easy again for your end users, whether they’re printing from a BYOD or mobile device, and makes your life easy by auto-deploying print drivers.

 

We’ve got truckloads more on offer, from industry-leading third-party integrations to easy tap-and-release Find-Me printing.

WHAT WAS ON YOUR LAST UNCOLLECTED PRINTOUT?

Secure all documents before, during, and after printing

Organizations spend a fortune protecting their digital data but a leak could be as simple as leaving a document on the printer.

 

Control device access, implement secure print release or even digitally sign and watermark your print jobs to take security to a new level.

WAS YOUR LAST JOB DOUBLE-SIDED?

Shrink your footprint and your bills

Waste reduction and cost control is not about using a stick, it’s about subtly changing user behavior.

 

PaperCut is packed full of features such as encouraging duplex printing, implementing reasonable usage quotas, and full pay-for-print and print chargeback policies.

 

When we surveyed our customers, we found that implementing just one feature, like secure print release, helped them save as much as 15%.
