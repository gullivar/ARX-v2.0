I'm not sure if there's a source for any of them as none of them have backstories relating to them. 

None of the other Part 3 antagonists have nationalities either, which is weird 15:06, 27 December 2025 – JojoMessi commented on Dragona Joestar : Not sure why the wiki page insists on using gener neutral pronouns. As of now: The manga, the jojo magazine and the official website, all refer to Dragona using male pronouns. The reason why some characters refer to him using female pronouns is because of they mistake him for his appearance, which i thought it was a pretty clear recurrent thing since the first episode with the police incident but now i see it isnt clear enough for some people. 03:04, 27 December 2025 – Polnarefflover602 commented on Jolyne Cujoh : i love jolyne i have so many drawings of her (counting stone free) and a nendoroid of her and giant figure of SF i love herrrrr 02:01, 27 December 2025 – Spankz commented on Vanilla Ice : source for nationality? 00:22, 27 December 2025 – Mazabara commented on Manhattan Transfer : cool bit of potential trivia, this looks heavily inspired by Jim Burns' "Refuge" painting from 1980. https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/84c/ [email protected] 03:14, 24 December 2025 – Joshua Joestar commented on Name Variants : I think that we should add Bobby Jean's full title of we are gonna add Key West's too 18:51, 21 December 2025 – KokichiOma commented on Lulu : I see some primary antagonist potential in here, maybe we should think about that 07:11, 20 December 2025 – Benn commented on Bobby Jean : Is the image of Bobby Jean's front appearance going to be updated to used the Shueisha coloured version? 19:16, 19 December 2025 – Vish commented on Key West : It released in Japan 2 days ago. 18:26, 19 December 2025 – Texas commented on Jonathan Joestar : what if Jonathan just appeared in Part 2 alongside Speedwagon Poll Poll Results How long do you think Part 9: The JOJOLands will be?
