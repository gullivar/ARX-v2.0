I love it because it has no stuffing for him to accidentally inhale. Even if he does tear the fabric exterior, it still functions as a rubber toy, so there’s no waste Through wit, pun, slapstick and occasional political swag-BARK's toys allow owners to share life experiences with their dogs. I never buy dog toys or treats anywhere else…and it’s so fun seeing their faces when we open a new box together! If your pooch has teeth of steel and tears through just about every toy they’ve ever been given, we love the Super Chewer box. You can customize everything based on your doggie's likes...

The toys hold up quite well and are super cute." ★★★★★ Michelle W. "After 2 years of BarkBox, this dog has 3 overflowing toy boxes! ...BarkBox pays attention to what each pet parent requests and we really couldn't be happier." ★★★★★ GG D. "We have been getting the BarkBox for the last two years and it is an awesome deal!" ★★★★★ Tommy K. "I have a dog with a chicken sensitivity, which can make it difficult to purchase treats.

What kind of toys are in a BarkBox? + Toys in the original BarkBox are fluffy, squeaky, and cuddly. But if your dog is a heavy chewer that needs more durable toys, then we recommend our Super Chewer subscription. What size should I get for my dog? + We offer 3 sizes. All sizes are the same price, and you can switch sizes at any time. Is BarkBox approved for puppies and different dog breeds? + Yes, BarkBox offers hours of dog fun, regardless of your pup’s age, breed, or size. For puppies, you can always size up later by contacting our Happy team at [email protected] . What is the difference between BarkBox and Super Chewer? + BarkBox toys should last long enough for your pup to enjoy it! These toys tend to be more fluffy, squeaky, and cuddly.

Super Chewer is going to be more for your dog that may be a heavy chewer that needs more durable toys. We work to create assortments of toys that cover a range of different durabilities (and other characteristics). A Super Chewer toy might not last forever, but it should last for as long as your dog wants it to. Because that's fun. Is BarkBox Customizable? + Yes! We know that every pup is unique. That's why you can always tailor your box based on food sensitivities, chew styles, play styles, durability, size, breed, and more. Reach out to our Happy team at [email protected] to start customizing! How much does a BarkBox cost? + Prices for subscriptions start as low as $24 per month! We offer 1-, 6-, and 12-month plans. How can you cancel a BarkBox? + If your pup isn't happy with their BarkBox, we’ll work with you to make it right. You may disable the auto-renewal on your multi-month subscription commitment at any time from your account dashboard here.

If you would like to end your subscription commitment early, please contact our Happy team. Please note, however, that your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current subscription term.
