Website translation made easy

GTranslate can translate any HTML website and make it multilingual. It will help you to increase international traffic, reach a global audience and explore new markets.

WEBSITE TRANSLATION GROWS SALES

If you live in an English-speaking country, you may not have considered translating your website content. However, webmasters are increasingly recognising the importance of including content that appeals to a global audience, and which addresses them in their mother-tongue languages. After all, just 27% of Internet users are English speaking according to the World Internet Statistics. Moreover, a study carried out by the Common Sense Advisory found that a massive 85% of online shoppers would only purchase from websites that discussed the products in their own language even if they were able to understand other languages used on the site.
