The Politics major (@brandeisupolitics) at Brandeis challenges students to think critically about power, justice, and shared responsibility in an increasingly complex world. For Politics major Gonny Nir ’25, the program’s close faculty mentoring and interdisciplinary approach, including her work in philosophy, helped her examine political ideas in both theory and practice while building the skills to engage thoughtfully across differences.

“My education at Brandeis has turned me into a more curious, empathetic person who seeks what we share with those who are different from me — qualities I think are undervalued but essential in our world.” — Gonny Nir ’25

Behind the scenes at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health

When psychology major Esther Bistricer ’26 signed up for a (@hiattcareercenter) Hiatt Career Center job-shadowing experience, she expected a day centered on research. Instead, she discovered a completely new side of higher education: the behind-the-scenes world of student affairs and university administration.

Through Hiatt’s program, Esther shadowed Brandeis alum (@brandeisalumni) Samantha Goldman ’14, spending the day sitting in on strategy meetings, touring facilities, attending a student award ceremony, and seeing how administrative teams collaborate to support students and keep a major institution running.

“There are a lot of jobs that were kind of mysterious to me. You see an event, but you don’t see all the work behind it,” Esther said.

The shadowing experience also gave her candid advice about career choices, job searching, and navigating life after graduation.

“Sometimes you’re just doing a job to get your foot in the door, and you learn a lot from every job you take.”

Tap the 🔗 in our bio to read the full story and learn how the Hiatt Career Center helps students explore career paths, connect with alumni, and discover what’s possible.

When Ben Lambright ’24, MS’25 introduces himself, he keeps it simple: he’s a Brandeis student completing his master’s in computational linguistics. But his work is anything but simple.

“Computational linguistics is the study of language and grammar from a computational perspective,” he explains. “We build large databases and computer algorithms to model language and automate processes that rely on it.”

Ben discovered the field as an undergraduate majoring in computer science and linguistics. The faculty relationships he built and the research he began early on made continuing at Brandeis an easy choice.

“I had a great experience here,” he says. “I knew the professors, and I knew I could keep doing the research I started.”

For his capstone, he’s bringing together language, computing, and real-world problem solving.

“I’m using AI to help resize 3D-printable prosthetic hands,” he says. “I’m building a chatbot and integrating different AI components to make the process more patient-friendly and easier for the average person to understand.”

He especially values the close-knit community. “The community is great. It’s small, so you really build strong friendships and connections,” he says. “I actually heard about my job through a friend in the program. The network is tight, and the classes feel approachable when you’re working together with your classmates.”

That job? “Last week, I accepted an offer at Babel Street, a company that processes large amounts of text data.”

🔗 Read more about Ben’s path and the computational linguistics master’s program at the link in our bio.

“Biochemistry at Brandeis pushed me to think across disciplines. I’m carrying that into my career and hope to keep combining insights from different fields to work toward shared goals with others.” — Gauri Gajeshwar ’25

At Brandeis, biochemistry students build a strong foundation in the molecular principles that drive life, working at the intersection of biology, chemistry, and quantitative science. The program emphasizes hands-on research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the problem-solving skills needed for careers in medicine, biotechnology, and advanced scientific inquiry.

Balancing school, a global fencing career, and a drive toward the 2028 Olympics is the reality for Lev BenAvram ’26.

A business major (@brandeisbusiness) and Hebrew Language, Literature and Culture minor, Lev splits his time between classes, practice, and international travel. Over the last year, he has fenced in Tunisia, Paris, Budapest, Seoul, Los Angeles, and beyond while serving as saber captain for the Brandeis men’s (@brandeisfencing) fencing team.

Ranked seventh in the United States and 144th in the world, Lev competes on three levels at once: collegiate meets, domestic North American Cups, and international World Cups and Grand Prix tournaments. The pace is intense, with international travel often requiring days away from campus and constant schedule adjustments.
Lev credits his love for the sport and support from his professors and teammates as the reason he can keep going.

“Loving fencing is most important,” he says. “The support here makes the biggest difference.”

His long term goal is clear: qualifying for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. After graduation, he plans to train full time in New York City while coaching and competing internationally.

For now, he is focused on his senior season at Brandeis and continuing to work toward improving his world ranking.

🔗 in bio for the full story of Lev’s journey and the Brandeis community supporting it.

Brandeis environmental studies (@brandeisenvironmentalstudies) and biology (@biobrandeis) professor Colleen Hitchcock received the US–UK Fulbright Global Challenges Teaching Award, and she is using it to open up the world for her students.

This fall, she is leading Brandeis’ first ever Virtual Exchange and Collaborative Online International Learning course, bringing together her Biology of Climate Change class with students at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. Students from both universities are exploring how biodiversity and human communities experience climate change in Massachusetts and in the Scottish Lowlands.

Through weekly online sessions, shared data projects and fieldwork at places such as Walden Pond and the Charles River, students are seeing what climate change looks like in real ecosystems and learning how global collaboration strengthens scientific understanding.

Hitchcock’s work reflects Brandeis’ ongoing commitment to global learning, interdisciplinary discovery and hands on academic experiences for all students.
Read the full story at the 🔗 in our bio.
