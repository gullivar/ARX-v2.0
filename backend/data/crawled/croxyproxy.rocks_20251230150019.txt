 The best privacy protection

CroxyProxy is a good alternative to a VPN. Unlike VPNs, web proxy traffic remains hidden. You can even open one web page through the proxy and keep other traffic direct, and it's all part of the free service, saving you money.

CroxyProxy is user-friendly; no downloads or browser configurations are needed. It supports various devices and operating systems, including Windows desktops, Android devices, Chromebooks, and more.
