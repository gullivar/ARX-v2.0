And it's killing your growth. You write your own sales pages. You create your own content. You build your own upsells. You manage your own email sequences. And every time you want to launch something new, it takes weeks. Sometimes months. Meanwhile, you watch other people in your space launching product after product. Cranking out content. Testing new offers. And pulling ahead of you. Here's the thing. It's not that you're not working hard enough. You're probably working too hard. ‍ The problem is you're doing $50/hour tasks when you should be doing $500/hour work. ‍ What if you had a team that could write your sales pages, create your content, and build your upsells for you? ‍ What if launching a new product took days instead of months? ‍ What if you could finally stop being the bottleneck?
