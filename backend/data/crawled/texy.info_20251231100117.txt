Texy – human friendy markup for PHP TEXY Menu home syntax for developers Playground API GitHub Texy! is sexy! Texy is a powerful and secure markup processor for PHP that converts simple text into valid HTML. Unlike
other markup languages, Texy isn't just another Markdown variant – it's a fully configurable system that you can adapt
to virtually any syntax. Why Texy? Security as a Priority Texy is designed with security in mind. It automatically protects against XSS attacks , validates URLs, and filters
dangerous HTML tags. The built-in safeMode() is ideal for processing user-generated content in comments or
forums. Texy\Configurator::safeMode($texy);
// Texy is now safe for user-generated content Full Configurability Want to use Markdown syntax? Or need completely custom markup? Texy can handle it. You can: Disable or enable any parts of the syntax Change default behavior using handlers Add entirely custom syntax elements Configure Texy to process Markdown or any other format $texy = new Texy;
$texy->allowed['image'] = false; // disable images
$texy->allowed['phrase/strong'] = false; // disable bold text Advanced Typography Texy provides sophisticated typographic processing that can be tailored to different languages. Depending on the
configured locale, it automatically: Inserts non-breaking spaces after single-letter prepositions and conjunctions Applies word hyphenation according to syllable rules Uses proper typographic quotation marks based on language conventions Applies proper dash and hyphen distinction : 10–15 (dash) vs. multi-word (hyphen) Adds non-breaking spaces in phone numbers: +420 776 552 046 Valid and Well-Formed HTML Texy always generates valid HTML5 code . It automatically corrects improperly nested tags, closes unclosed elements, and
ensures proper document structure. The output is not only valid but also beautifully formatted with proper indentation. What is Texy? Texy is a general-purpose markup text processor . While it has its default syntax (similar to Markdown but much richer),
you can completely change or extend it. It's not just a parser – Texy is a comprehensive system with modular architecture, where each module processes a
specific part of the syntax (headings, links, images, tables…). Thanks to the handler system, you can intervene at any point in
the processing and modify the result according to your needs. Texy vs. Markdown The basic syntax is similar, but Texy offers much more: Feature Markdown Texy Bold text **text** **text** Italic *text* or _text_ *text* or //text// Headings # Heading # Heading or underline Images ![alt](url) [* url *] Tables limited full support including merging Modifiers no yes – .{color:red}[class] Typography no yes – quotes, dashes, spaces Word hyphenation no yes – by syllables Configurability limited complete – custom syntax Security depends on impl. built-in (safeMode) Example of differences: Markdown:

developed for PHP 4 , it has undergone many updates throughout its long history and today fully leverages all the
capabilities of PHP 8 . Over two decades of active development mean a proven and stable library trusted by hundreds of projects.
