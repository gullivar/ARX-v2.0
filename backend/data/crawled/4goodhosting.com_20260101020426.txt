What Do Our Customers Think? Before choosing a web hosting plan, it's a good idea to research the experiences existing customers have had with us and shared in online reviews. Here are examples of 4GoodHosting reviews from customers who have chosen us as their web hosting provider. "I think they deserve 5 stars in everything, because their prices are good and in my 3 years with them Ive never noticed downtime. But on that scale, I wish I coukd give 6 or even 10 stars for their customer service. They guarantee response within the hour, no matter what time of day, and I have found that to be true. And they stick with you ubtil the problem is fixed... Even as a low dollar amount client, Ive always felt important." Patrick Ryckman "Smooth service and helpful support. Once I encountered some issues they were right on it when I raised a ticket. Was able to speak with the manager Michael literally in a minute without any issues once I asked for it - you won't get this level of personal attention at any other hosting. He took care of everything properly and made sure all is right and gave a follow-up call once all was ready. 5 stars." Igor W "I contacted 4GoodHosting in regards to migrating a website to their hosting. I had no idea how the process really worked but they were happy to advise me on the process. The customer service was some of the best I've ever had online. I was lucky enough to get to personally speak with the owner who happily managed my requests in a quick and timely fashion. Would definitely recommend 4GoodHosting if you're looking for a great product, at a good price combined with excellent customer service." Adam Doolittle Frequently Asked Questions R Why do I need a website for my business? The reason nearly every business or venture of any size will have a website is very clear. The increasing prominence of e-commerce and the way people most often find a business through a mobile or other web browsing device makes an attractive, functional website a must for all businesses. Custom domain names with 4GoodHosting start at $14.95 per year. R Why get a domain name from 4GoodHosting? We make it easy for you to use our domain name checker to see if the domain name (URL) you have in mind for your website is available. If so, we’re able to secure it for you and then you’ll have that domain name for a fixed period of time until you need to renew ownership. We’ll make you aware of when that renewal date is approaching, and then you can pay to renew your domain. The domain name is yours to use for as long as you choose once 4GoodHosting has registered it for you and you continue to renew yearly. R Why do I need a professional email? The consensus on professional email is that it is better because it’s more secure, it can promote your brand name and create positive associations, and it in a more general sense it contributes to an increasingly professional image. Another known advantage is that it is less likely that someone will consider your emails to be spam if they see a professional email address from the sender. A custom domain name following your name and the ampersand (@) is your best choice. R Why should I transfer my domain to 4GoodHosting for Canadian web hosting? We can transfer your entire website, email, CMS, and / or databases while maintaining root access and all that is required is to pre-pay for at least annual billing.

We conduct automated backups and analytics daily and we sync our disaster recovery servers every 6 hours to provide the best in data loss protection. You are better protected against data breaches, hackers, and ransomware attacks and in the event of a major hardware failure we can have your site back online in hours with no data loss.

We have two website builders available here, and you can try them for free .
