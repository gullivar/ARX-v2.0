Infinite Helium innovatively circulates helium in a closed loop, enabling your continuous flow cryostat to operate without constant helium replenishment. Designed with adaptability in mind, Infinite Helium seamlessly integrates with your existing or new continuous flow cryostats to enable cryogen-free operation. While it’s commonly paired with our ST‑500 cryostat for microscopy, ST‑400 cryostat for UHV/beamline applications, and ST‑FTIR or STVP‑NMR cryostats, its compatibility extends across our entire range of continuous flow cryostats. Automation features further reduce user error, simplifying the cooldown process and valve adjustments, ensuring consistent and optimal performance.
