Global Footprint

Speed Sonar has a global data-center footprint to assist in the monitoring and auditing of internet routing. We measure your customer's reality, not optimal peering routes.

Security First

Digital performance is great, but security is fundamental. Join our customers and learn about the routing risks that affect your data.

How It Works
Federated Test Nodes

Speed Sonar leverages a global network of test sensors to accurately time network latency to microsecond precision. Tests can be performed on schedule, randomly, or on demand to fit the most demanding audit scenarios. Evaluate performance changes, validate service performance requirements, and unlock improvements to your network ROI.

Testimonials

 It was amazing to see what was happening to clients transiting our networks with data from Speed Sonar. Having a neutral third-party involved took away the politics of making improvements and suggesting changes to our network.
