Jun 30, 2020 Dr. Eren Bilgen @ErenBilgen Finding it difficult to remain focused while #workingfromhome? @momentumdash productivity app is a visual tool to schedule tasks & remain focused on what needs to be done each day – One of the tips we discussed in today’s #PGRtraining session @AstonUniversity #TeamAston #phdchat Jun 23, 2020 Amaresh @bingzzy @momentumdash, thanks for the daily dose of #motivational quotes and showing me some incredible photos of this beautiful #earth every single day. I am glad I installed you May 15, 2020 Anne-Marie Bowler O'Neil @a912m430o @momentumdash Thank you for the beautiful scenery dashboards. So calming and peaceful in today's world upheaval. Desktop computer #InItTogether Mar 24, 2020 Dan Meehan @mrdanielmeehan Today's @momentumdash mantra is "Be grateful." I usually mock things like this but considering the times it's a helpful reminder that among all the uncertainty I'm lucky to have good friends & family. Whatever comes we'll get through this, together. #ThursdayThoughts #covid19UK Mar 19, 2020 Cameron Norman @cdnorman Thank you @momentumdash for bringing a little beauty to my everyday with your Chrome add-on. It's a small thing, but every time I open a tab and see a stunning picture of nature it reminds of the wonders of this planet. We need this. #gratitude Mar 19, 2020 Trent Johnsen @trentjohnsen I continue to be #grateful daily how a simple #Chrome plugin adds to the quality of my day 🙏 Thank you @momentumdash Jan 29, 2020 Daniel Carral @dcarral Good vibes & flowistic quote, thanks @momentumdash Ok hand “Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to #smile about.” Jan 28, 2020 Kate Trigger Duffert @ktriggerduffert The @momentumdash plug in for Chrome has been my favorite shift in internet over the past several years. It's customizeable and keeps me thinking forward/sane. Nov 6, 2019 Todd Burleson @todd_burleson I love EVERYTHING about my screen today @momentumdash My favorite place, a great mantra, and an inspiring quote.  Thank you for helping me get my day started with so much positivity! #carpediem Sep 24, 2019 Leeor Alexandra @leeoralexandra One of the easiest, most powerful ways I've changed my daily life is by using the @momentumdash plugin for Chrome. It shows you your to-do list right on your homepage, so whenever you get sidetracked, you get a reminder when you pull up a new tab about what you're supposed to focus on. Then it asks you, what's your focus for today? and you get to set your intention and keep being reminded of it. The beautiful imagery & the quotes are all a plus, also. Jul 10, 2019 Sarah Goodall @SarahGoodall Absolutely love my @momentumdash in Chrome with daily quotes, pictures and a chance to add a daily goal - today is about survival :-) #goals #dailyquotes #dailyquote Jun 9, 2019 Rochelle Maynard @rlmaynard7 If you are not already using @momentumdash , you should.  Install the extension to see a new quote every day.  Favorite the quote and/or tweet it out.  If anything, enjoy the various pictures of various (beautiful) places each day #travel #InspirationalQuotes #mottos #LifeLessons Jan 19, 2019 Anu Rana @anuxrana “What do you do with a mistake: recognize it, admit it, learn from it, forget it.” - Dean smith. I love the @momentumdash chrome extension. As a traveler I love seeing a new amazing photo every day and the quotes are actually inspiring. May 21, 2019 Rishabh Jain @rishabhjain1403 I have been using #Momentum for years now. Getting a new wallpaper and a quote every morning is just so refreshing. Recently I started using the focus field to put my screen cast focus. Just a small tweak, but adds a lot of value. Thank you @momentumdash for this awesome extension Sep 3, 2018 Shay La Vie @shaydechelle I love this @momentumdash plugin for Chrome. It makes being on the computer all day suck a little bit less. Jan 23, 2019 Felicia @felicia_voices I love this app for my focus - @momentumdash is such a great way to start the work day! Todays little quote ~"People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.”
		Ralph Waldo Emerson Jul 31, 2020 Day @Dayanalorza My @momentumdash this morning is gorgeous. For those that don't know it's an extension that displays a picture and other info when you open a new tab in chrome. My 'todo' for the day is to conquer it.
