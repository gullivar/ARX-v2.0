Terry Archer I have been a client of Hosting Australia for the past couple of years, the teams responsiveness to changes I need and the customer service is fantastic.

SSD Storage Free SSL Certificate CloudLinux LiteSpeed Server Are you putting your data at risk? SSDs are three times faster than the traditional HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) where data was stored in the past. Some website hosting providers still rely on old hardware, putting their customer data at risk of getting lost, as HDDs are not just slower but also a lot less reliable. Hosting Australia doesn’t compromise on quality when it comes to our customers’ data and hosting experience. SSD Speed HDD Speed SSL certificates are the way to go if you want your website safe from prying eyes. Google will not only reward a site with an SSL certificate, but also warn people who enter it that they’re visiting something reputable and trustworthy – which means better rankings in search engines as well! Non SSL (http) Secure SSL (https) CloudLinux provides a solution for keeping hosting severs running effeciently. If one website requires more server resources than expected, it can quickly drain all of the available resources on the server, which will begin to affect other sites in an adverse manner – either slowing them down or shutting them out completely! One way Hosting Australia offers protection against these problems is by providing automatic scaling options, via Cloud Linux, so you never need worry about your site being heldup during peak hours. Lite Speed Web Server (LSWS) is an efficient, lightweight web serving software that provides fast performance and security without compromising server resources. It has high scalability with its built in DDoS protection capabilities to allow for higher speeds and better performance. If you need maximum capacity while still ensuring stability of your site, Hosting Australia’s LiteSpeed web hosting is the ONLY choice.
