How iPostal1 Works
Choose a Location and Plan. Choose a physical address from 4,000+ digital mailbox locations in the U.S. and internationally. Then select the personal or business plan that is best for you and how much mail you expect to receive.
Checkout. At checkout, provide your contact information plus credit card or PayPal account. (PayPal is not available for mailbox locations in Canada.)
Verification of Identity. After signing up for a location you will be assigned a personal mailbox number and receive instructions for verifying your identity to help prevent fraud:
For U.S. locations, the USPS requires the Form 1583 be completed, notarized, and filed with two forms of ID. Your mail center may allow you to sign in their presence for a small fee. To notarize your form without going to your mail center, you must use our secure and convenient online notary provider for $25.
For locations outside the U.S., you will also need to complete a required identity verification process.
Redirect Your Mail. To forward mail from U.S. addresses and receive mail at your new address, file a Temporary Change of Address form with the USPS and/or notify senders directly. To forward mail from addresses outside the U.S., check your local postal service procedures.
Now you can:
View and Manage Your Mail from Anywhere 24/7. See your mail as soon as it is received. Use our free app or any computer to view an image of the outside of each mail item you receive. With a click or tap, tell your mail center what you want to do with each item: forward, scan, schedule a pickup, discard, or shred.
Receive Mail & Packages from Any Carrier. Because every iPostal digital mailbox address is a real street address, not a standard postal box, you can receive mail and packages not only from the USPS, but also from FedEx, UPS and other carriers.
Add Locations with Just a Click. It’s fast and easy to add additional address locations for business or personal use. Manage mail for all locations from one login.
