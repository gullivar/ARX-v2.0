Structured to Always Put Your Interests First Client-Focused Investment Experience Top-Down, Global Investment Approach Independent Client-Focused Since our founding in 1979, we’ve done things differently than other investment firms—not just to be different, but because we believe it makes a difference for our clients. We designed our business to always put our clients first. We separate service, sales and portfolio management roles to ensure you’re always working with someone focused in their area and on you. We believe this division of labor ensures you have our undivided care at every step of our relationship. Investment Experience Fisher Investments’ five-member Investment Policy Committee (IPC), supported by a dedicated research staff, make all strategic investment decisions for client portfolios. The IPC has over 150 combined years of industry experience. Top-Down, Global Investment Approach Our time-tested, top-down portfolio management approach starts by analyzing broad global economic, political and sentiment factors. Using that analysis, we find opportunities across investment categories before narrowing down to the specific securities we believe will perform well moving forward. Independent We’re privately held, which means we control our destiny. In our view, our independence means we are better able to do what’s best for our clients and think differently from many in our industry. How We Can Help Personal Wealth Management We help individuals and families achieve their goals through tailored investment portfolios, personalized client service, comprehensive financial planning resources and more. Wealth Management Services Institutional Investing We have a long history of managing assets for some of the world’s largest, most prestigious institutions, including corporations, pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and many others.
