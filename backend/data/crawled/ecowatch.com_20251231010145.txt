Methane 101: Understanding the Second Most Important Greenhouse Gas
BY ECOWATCH / August 5, 2025

By Olivia Rosane and Cristen Hemingway Jaynes Quick Key Facts What Is Methane? What has no color or smell and is found in wetlands, cow burps and your basement furnace? The answer is methane — a powerful greenhouse gas that is the second most important contributor to the climate crisis after carbon dioxide (CO2). It is the primary component of natural gas, which currently generates around 25 percent of the world’s electricity.  Methane is a hydrocarbon composed of four hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbon atom. It is abundant in […]

A Complete Guide to Chaos Gardening
BY LINNEA HARRIS / August 15, 2024

If the idea of meticulously planning and caring for a garden brings you nothing but stress, this gardening trend might bring you nothing but joy.  Chaos gardening is a laid-back (and haphazard) approach to gardening, built on the notion that you can garden without expensive tools or extensive know-how, and that embracing the unexpected and unplanned can yield beautiful and bountiful results.  If you’re looking for a reason to let go of the rules and let nature work its magic, look no further. What Is Chaos Gardening? It started off as a TikTok trend, but chaos gardening is becoming a more practiced method of planting. It was even featured in some displays at the 2023 Chelsea Flower Show in London.  And, it’s exactly what it sounds like: rebelling against tidy gardens and strict rules about […]

A Philosopher’s Guide to an Ethical Diet: A Conversation With Peter Singer
BY MICHAEL RIOJAS / April 10, 2024

Humans have an enormous impact on planet Earth, but from both an animal welfare and an environmental perspective, perhaps nothing is more important than our diets. In 2022, more than 82 billion livestock animals were slaughtered for meat, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States, with the majority of those animals being factory farmed. In addition to enormous animal welfare implications, the practice of farming animals is estimated to account for somewhere between 11% and 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions. All things considered, what is the most ethical diet? According to utilitarian moral philosopher Peter Singer, it’s one that includes zero — or at least very few — animal products. Singer is among the most influential living philosophers and is widely credited for putting animal ethics on the map with […]

‘We Have Just Arrived’: Author Rick Bass on Writing and Activism in Montana
BY CRAIG THOMPSON / March 8, 2024

Rick Bass is an American author of more than thirty books, both fiction and non-fiction, on a wide range of topics. An environmental activist, he is also an artist drawn to the beauty of the natural world. The winner of numerous awards, his most recent essay collection, With Every Great Breath, was released this February by Counterpoint Press and includes three new essays along with a selection of eighteen written over nearly three decades. Counterpoint Press Bass is based in the Yaak Valley in Montana. “It’s a land of extremes and superlatives,” he says. Through the Yaak Valley Forest Council, Bass and a group of locals work to preserve the valley from logging, and are also trying to convince the U.S. Forest Service to reroute the Pacific Northwest Trail away from grizzly bear habitat, of […]

‘To Dye For’: The Toxic Evolution of Fast Fashion by Alden Wicker
BY CRISTEN HEMINGWAY JAYNES / September 6, 2023

Some books take you on epic emotional journeys, while others provide you with knowledge and insights on a new subject. To Dye For, an account of the toxic evolution of fast fashion by Alden Wicker — from its mauvine- and arsenic-tinted beginnings to the takeover of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — does both. It is essential reading for those who have ever experienced skin sensitivity, a rash or worse due to clothing laden with harmful chemicals. And for anyone interested in the true cost of the modern fast fashion that is polluting the world with toxins and discarded bargain clothing. I had the pleasure of talking with Wicker recently about the book, which delves into the toxicity of contemporary fast fashion, as well as its Victorian era origins. I asked how she first became […]

Tasty, Carbon-Negative Kelp Burgers Are ‘Everything That’s Right With the Food System’
BY CRISTEN HEMINGWAY JAYNES / August 4, 2023

There are all sorts of meatless burgers out there, from bean and soy to those trying to look and taste like beef, but have you ever tried a Kelp Burger? If not, you’re missing out on a flavorful, nuanced, sustainable eating experience. Kelps are large brown seaweeds or algae that grow in underwater forests. There are 30 different types, and they are all extremely beneficial for the environment. Kelp absorbs carbon dioxide from seawater to the tune of nearly five million tons each year, according to New Scientist, which helps reduce ocean acidification, as well as sequesters phosphorus and nitrogen. Kelp also provides habitat for fish and other marine life. Kelp isn’t just good for the ocean and the atmosphere, it’s good for you — tasty and packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. In 2021, […]
