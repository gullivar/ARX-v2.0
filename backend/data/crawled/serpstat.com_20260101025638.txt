I like Serpstat because it allows me to easily see which keywords bring up featured snippets on the results page.

Neil Patel

Co-Founder, Neil Patel Digital

Serpstat is another comprehensive keyword research toolthat I discovered recently. They've done some really good work when it comes to helping us identify winning keywords.

Harsh Agrawal

Founder and CEO, ShoutMeLoud

I love that it tracks SEO over a time period, tracking keyword growth across your site and competitors over time. I'll leverage it on client meetings to show how their current SEO guy is failing.

Jena Apgar

Marketing Strategist, 2xMyBiz.com

It helps you understand how your site and sites belonging to competitors are performing in paid and organic search, and what to do about things you want to improve.

John Newton

Marketing Director, Oxygen Finance

Serpstat has excellent competitor analysis capabilities and the ability to make teamwork with the multi-user account.

Uliana Pliatsko

Business Development Manager, Closely

Serpstat helps us to track positions in SERP, see changes, and make perfect competitors research. Positions are the same as during a manual search in the corresponding countries.

Anastasiia Zmushko

SEO Team Lead, MatchOffice

For my use, there is much to like about Serpstat. I really like the site audit tool and information I can gather on competitors. Most of all, I like all of the training and support they provide.

Janeiro Blackmon

Digital Marketing Consultant, DesignBlaze Marketing

Serpstat UI is one of the most user-friendly and intuitive in any SEO tools I use. I enjoy using it on a day to day basis as the insights it provides, especially site audit.

Ivan Kychatyi

Co-Founder, UAtalents

I really love the site audit feature. I've used it to clean up old articles and redirections to my website.
