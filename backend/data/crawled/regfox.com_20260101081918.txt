Exceptional Platform, Exceptional Customer Service

"RegFox is hands down the easiest and most user-friendly event management/registration tool on the market. The whole process from start to finish was one of the easier I've ever used, and I am a past Cvent and Eventbrite user."

- Diana G, from g2.com

Best Event Registration Platform, Period.

“So easy to set up new events, incredibly intuitive interface on both internal and customer-facing sides, feature-rich, great dashboard data, drag and drop layout.”

- Pete M, from g2.com

Great Product. Even Better Customer Service!

"Setting up the events was easy. The site is intuitive. But the best part is the outstanding customer service and tech support! The team is quick to respond to any questions I have had.  Not having to pay a yearly fee upfront was also a huge plus!"

- Shannon M, from g2.com

Ease, Beauty, and Savings

“What first struck me about RegFox was the ease in building a beautiful registration page. I wanted pages that had the same feeling as my website - friendly, aesthetically pleasing, AND that I could build myself.”

- Sharon S, from g2.com

Fantastic Event Registration Company

“My organization had their first virtual conference  with the support of RegFox and it was a wonderful virtual event. The registration page, confirmation letter, and reminders were highly professional and easy to set up. The support from RegFox was amazing and they were very affordable.

- Jane W, from g2.com

Switched From Eventbrite to RegFox

“RegFox has been a great switch for us and I love the way we can make attractive events with less fees to registrants. They continue to add new features and are very easy to reach for support."

- Stacy D from Capterra
