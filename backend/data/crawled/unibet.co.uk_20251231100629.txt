Many people believe that the concept of gambling is older than writing, and its precise origins are practically impossible to determine. Although gambling stayed popular for centuries, it remained largely unchanged until the modern digital age.

Online gambling was born in 1994 when the first online casino venues emerged, and game designers began creating a world of new and virtual casino games. Online casino sites gained tremendous popularity, a phenomenon that has only escalated since the mid-1990s.

As technology advances, so too do online casinos. Popular casino games, slot games, and even live casino games can now be played online. Playing your favourite casino games from the comfort of your own home has many undeniable advantages, which is why online gambling has gone from strength to strength over the last few decades.
