Page publishing in a few clicks Easily publish new pages based on the generated list of keywords. For each keyword or query, Vpage will retrieve relevant products from your catalog and build a page.

Learn more Vlink (internal linking) Dynamic contextual linking Our system analyzes each page content, keywords, and lexical field, automatically embedding links that enrich your site’s contextual relevance and user experience. Flexible link management Control link placement by creating rules based on H1 tags, meta titles, URLs, or custom criteria, including prioritization and link density. Easy-to-install technology Choose from server-side API integration for a tailored backend solution or a simple, one-line JavaScript for instant client-side implementation, both offering seamless integration. Learn more Vrender (dynamic rendering) Crawlable pages for every bot Crawlers can’t read JavaScript. Vrender detects search and AI bots like Googlebot, ChatGPT, and PerplexityBot, and serves them a clean, fully rendered HTML version of your page — ensuring it’s fully crawlable and indexable. Reduced server load Bots already account for over 50% of e-commerce traffic — and that number is growing fast. Vrender handles bot traffic separately by serving pre-rendered HTML pages from its own infrastructure. The result? Lighter load on your servers, faster performance for users, and lower infrastructure costs. Improved crawl efficiency Search and AI bots operate on a limited crawl budget. Clean HTML pages load faster, letting bots crawl more of your content in less time. That means more pages indexed — and better visibility where it matters. Learn more Vmax (e-commerce conversion optimization) Optimal layout discovery Vmax transforms product pages into high-converting landing pages by testing and optimizing layout variations. It collects user interactions, computes predicted buying probabilities, and automatically identifies the layouts that perform best for each user, ensuring continuous improvement without the manual workload. Increased conversion rates By dynamically adjusting layouts based on visitor buying probability, Vmax significantly elevates conversion rates, transforming browsing into buying. Effortless implementation Vmax simplifies setup with no internal IT involvement required. Easily import your product catalog and let Vmax automatically test and refine your landing pages.
