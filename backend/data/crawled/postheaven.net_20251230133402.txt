What would it be like to make a service that lasts for 10 years? 100 years? That’s what we’re trying to build at Postheaven. We’re as sick as you are to have to switch services every few years, or worry about running your own servers and getting hacked all the time.

To do that, it’ll take a small team of engineers who quietly maintain the software like a constant gardener, quietly doing the right things over time.

That’s us.
