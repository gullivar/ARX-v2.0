But we’re more excited about what lies ahead than what we already accomplished. We’re on track for our second-highest year for pageviews — 6.6 million. This year we brought you more than 300 posts. Among our most-read stories this year include ones on metrics: The most-read of the year was on universities whose publication metrics show signs of “questionable authorship practices.” Also among the most-read stories was one on the 20 journals that lost their impact factors this year for citation issues. Fakery was also a theme in 2025. A story on a Springer Nature book full of fake references and one on dozens of papers with fake company affiliations were among the most popular of the year.

The study, published in July 2024 , reports the results of a trial comparing intravenous and intraosseous vascular access for treating people who experienced cardiac arrest. It has been cited 29 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The retraction marks the 13th The BMJ has issued since its first in 1989, according to the Retraction Watch Database .

For three years , researcher and sleuth Anna Abalkina has been tracking these clones in the Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker . Earlier this month, Anna’s list of hijacked journals surpassed 400 entries. We took the opportunity to ask her about the list’s history, what happens to journals on the list, how to spot a potentially hijacked journal, and more.

Ivana Frech  — formerly Ivana De Domenico — sued the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) in 2023 after the agency concluded she engaged in research misconduct while at the University of Utah, by “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating” images in work funded by the National Institutes of Health. In her legal complaint filed shortly after ORI’s debarment, Frech alleged the agency’s misconduct findings and debarment decision were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unsupported by substantial evidence, and contrary to law and regulation.” On December 12, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia threw out Frech’s suit, ruling in favor of the government’s motion for summary judgement. Summary motions are granted when a court finds no genuine dispute over material facts and a lack of conflicting evidence for a jury to weigh. The decision allows ORI’s three-year debarment – which runs through August 2026 – and misconduct conclusions against Frech to stand.

But his name wasn’t on it, nor was that of another scientist who had also been involved in preparing the manuscript. Instead, two professors Heese didn’t know had been added as authors on the paper , which appeared in June in Natural Product Communications . Alarmed, Heese emailed Sivakamavalli Jeyachandran , an associate professor at Saveetha University in Chennai, India, and one of the corresponding authors of the article. Heese had received an invitation in 2023 to help with the review from a former collaborator, Arulmani Manavalan , who was working with Jeyachandran and her student Hethesh Chellapandian.

The report, “ Nourishing Tomorrow: Addressing Obesity Through Food Systems in South Asia ,” was published in March 2025 in the World Bank Group’s Open Knowledge Repository. The document describes an analysis of how different food systems contribute to rising rates of  obesity in South Asian countries. Three of its four authors are employees of the World Bank. Muhammad Azam first came across the report in a WhatsApp group for sports science research in Pakistan, he told us. Azam, of the Government College University Lahore, has studied the prevalence of sports science research published in predatory journals in that country. So when a group member shared that some publications Azam knew to be suspect had been cited in the report, he took a closer look and found several “problematic entries,” he told us.

ORI typically releases an average of about 10 findings a year. The office, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, oversees research integrity and misconduct for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other HHS agencies. Its team of scientist-investigators review institutional inquiries and investigate possible research misconduct for a portfolio of publicly funded biomedical research that totals tens of billions of dollars. In response to questions on whether the office expects to release more rulings this year, an HHS spokesperson told us the office can’t comment on open cases or anticipated findings. “ORI’s Division of Investigative Oversight continues to carry out its oversight responsibilities, and staff actively engage in process improvements to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of responding to research misconduct allegations,” the spokesperson said.

One journal editor in chief called the results “concerning,” while another thought the analysis was looking for problems on purpose. The authors of the analysis, Vitali Mindel of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and Raffaele Ciriello of the University of Sydney in Australia, told Retraction Watch in a joint email they had set out to do a bibliometric study of “superstar” scholars in business research. The goal: “to understand the secret sauce behind exceptional productivity and success.” Continue reading ‘Elite cohort’ of biz school scholars and editors scratch each others’ backs, study finds Share this: Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Bluesky Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Posted on December 17, 2025 December 18, 2025 Author Ellie Kincaid Categories business 3 Comments on ‘Elite cohort’ of biz school scholars and editors scratch each others’ backs, study finds Posts pagination Page 1 Page 2 … Page 691 Next page Privacy policy Proudly powered by WordPress
