Sphero Coding Robots & Kits | PK-12 STEM Education, AI Literacy & CTE Sphero makes remarkably cool, programmable robots and STEAM-based educational tools that transform the way kids learn, create and invent through coding, science, music, and the arts.
    Using information available, combined with skills acquired, can help make good decisions. That’s the basic process of critical thinking. Critical thinkers can solve problems by keeping a clear mind and rational thoughts that will help you analyze a situation and make a sound decision. STEM teaching is the hands-on exploration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concepts, and it’s becoming an increasingly important part of modern-day education. STEM skills grant students the 21st-century abilities needed to perform a wide range of both essential and highly-skilled jobs. Risk-taking, leaping, trying again, and failing are part of our genetic material. Without it, humans would not have inhabited every corner of this planet. Oftentimes we can see failure, particularly in exams, as negative — one of the worst things we can allow students to experience. But what if we allow students to fail in a safe space and make learning a personal endeavor?

Educators Love Us, Too We’re captivating classrooms around the world—just take it from the teachers themselves. “Using Sphero robots has revolutionized STEM and computer science education in K-12 classrooms across our district. The intuitive design and hands-on nature of the different Sphero robots have captivated our students' attention and ignited a passion for learning.” - Alana D., Cobb County Schools, Marietta, GA “Every school in our district uses and LOVES Sphero Robotics! Our elementary schools use indis and BOLTs, and secondary students use BOLTs and RVR+s. Multi-disciplinary activities that utilize Spheros are embedded in our curriculum, and we often use Spheros at district and school-level family events.” – Paula H., Pueblo, CO “Sphero makes robotics and coding accessible to all our students! Their excitement in the elementary robotics lab is contagious, and using Sphero is inspiring our students to continue learning robotics in middle school!” – Reannah S., San Juan Capistrano, CA “From indi in kindergarten to BOLT+ in 4th grade and RVR+ with littleBits in middle school, we see engagement at every level. Sphero is easy to integrate across core subjects, so in our district, Sphero truly serves as an impactful learning partner, supporting our students' growth and development.” - Liz R., Deer Valley Unified School District “My older students adore BOLT+!  They have loved maneuvering them around the classroom and learning to program. My youngest students equally adore indi. Their faces light up when they see them, and they learn about patterns, debugging, and problem solving, while taking turns and having fun!” – Heather P., Appoquinimink School District “We are always looking for training and programs for teachers to inspire the next generation of STEM professionals. Sphero offers high-quality professional development and commits to supporting participants after the PD. The possibilities are endless, and the activities can support multiple content areas.” – Paulo O., New Mexico Space Grant Let’s Make Learning Fun Looking to bring Sphero to your school or district?
