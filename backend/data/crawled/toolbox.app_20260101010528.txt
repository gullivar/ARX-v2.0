Other versions
JetBrains Toolbox App
Manage your IDEs the easy way
Download.dmg (macOS Intel)
It’s free. System requirements
Update quickly and easily

Manage your JetBrains tools easily

Install
Update automatically
Update the plugins together with IDE
Roll back and downgrade

Save time and effort maintaining your IDEs, by downloading a patch or a set of patches instead of the full package download. Everything updates in the background while you never stop coding.

See what’s new

JetBrains Toolbox App lets you read all about the latest features and bug-fixes introduced into your IDE, before you update it.

Maintain multiple versions side by side

Handle several versions of the same tool easily. Be the first to try out the Early Access Programs (EAP) for JetBrains IDEs, and Google’s Android Studio releases and Canary builds, which can also be installed and updated through the JetBrains Toolbox App.

Open projects instantly

All of your projects are at your fingertips with your favorites pinned to the top. Find them quickly using the Search field, and open them instantly inside the correct IDE with a single click.

Remote IDE management

Install, update, and manage your JetBrains IDEs on remote machines just as easily as on your local setup. Work across Linux, Windows, and macOS with secure, flexible connections using built-in remote development support.

Integrate with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

Install the extension for Google Chrome or Firefox and you will be able to clone and open your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories right from your browser.

Save time and effort
with the JetBrains Toolbox App!
The @JBToolbox app makes managing JetBrains tools almost effortless! Highly recommended
