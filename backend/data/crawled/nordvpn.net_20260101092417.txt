Our massive network of VPN servers caters to all needs. Not a fan of constantly changing IP addresses but want the security? Get a dedicated IP and be the only one to use it! Want extra privacy? Use the Double VPN servers and encrypt your connection twice. Need to connect to a VPN in a heavily restrictive environment? Use our obfuscated servers to hide the very fact you’re using a VPN to reroute your traffic.

Need more privacy than a regular VPN can give? Enable Threat Protection Pro™, and it will even block third-party trackers from following you around the internet. NordVPN also doesn’t log your online activity, so what you do online is only your business.

Protects your internet connection

NordVPN uses the AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt your internet traffic before sending it through a secure VPN tunnel. The encryption scrambles your online data so much that no snoopers can view or use it — brute-forcing the cipher is virtually impossible.

What is a VPN?

VPN definition: A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool that protects your online activity from spying eyes. It makes your data safer from cybercriminals by encrypting your internet traffic and sending it through a secure tunnel. Every time you go online, your data is routed through a remote VPN server first. This way, it changes your IP address and virtual location, giving you safer and more private access to the internet.

What types of VPNs are there? 

VPNs come in various types, like personal VPNs, remote access VPNs, or VPN proxies. Each type of VPN works a little differently:



Personal VPN

A personal VPN connects your device to a VPN server to keep your internet activity private. It uses a VPN protocol to encrypt your connection so no one can see what you're doing online — neither snoopy parents nor your internet provider. This type is perfect for everyday use, like gaming or online shopping.



Site-to-site VPN

A site-to-site VPN is a VPN server setup that links two or more networks, for example, multiple company offices in different countries. It uses a secure VPN protocol to create a private tunnel so teams can share files and work like they’re in the same building. It’s great for businesses, but not that useful for personal use.



Remote access VPN

A remote access VPN lets you connect to your work or home network through a VPN server from anywhere in the world. It uses VPN protocols to encrypt your traffic and keeps your information safe while letting you use the data and tools as if you were there in person. It’s super helpful for remote workers.



Mobile VPN

A mobile VPN is made for devices that move around a lot. It keeps your connection to the VPN server stable even when switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data. Thanks to a special flexible VPN protocol, it avoids connection drops or interruptions while making your online traffic safer on the go — even on public Wi-Fi.



Browser-based VPN

A VPN proxy, or a browser-based VPN, is an extension you add to your browser. It connects to a VPN server, changes your IP, and encrypts just your web traffic coming from and to your browser. It’s fast and easy to use, but keep in mind that it doesn’t protect apps outside your browser.

Are VPNs legal? 

Yes, VPNs are legal in most countries around the world, including the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, and most of Europe, as long as you don't do anything illegal while using one.




However, countries that enforce online surveillance and censorship may restrict VPN usage or ban VPN services altogether. For example, VPNs are illegal in North Korea, Belarus, Oman, Iraq, and Turkmenistan. Other countries, like Russia and China, heavily restrict the use of VPNs.

What are the factors that affect VPN speed? 

Several factors can affect a VPN service’s speeds:



1.

Server location. The physical distance between your device and the VPN server plays a significant role. The farther away the server, the longer your traffic has to travel, which will reduce your connection speed. NordVPN’s global network, with servers covering 178+ locations, allows you to choose a server nearby and get the best VPN speeds possible.

2.

Encryption. Stronger encryption offers better security but will also slightly reduce speed. That’s why NordVPN created its own super lightweight NordLynx protocol to encrypt your traffic and ensure your connection is encrypted while maintaining amazing speeds.

3.

Server load. When too many users connect to the same VPN server, it can severely slow everyone down or even crash. NordVPN’s smart algorithm manages server loads effectively, ensuring that you always connect to a server that’s best for you — and other users on it.

4.

Network congestion. Your own internet connection speed and overall bandwidth can affect VPN performance. A high-speed internet connection is crucial for a smooth VPN experience — your load times will be terrible if your baseline connection is weak.

5.

VPN software. The performance of the VPN app you use will also impact speed. NordVPN offers dedicated apps for all major platforms that are designed for efficiency.

How to choose the best VPN? 

The best VPN is the one that doesn’t slow you down, helps you be safer online, and doesn’t compromise your privacy. So to choose the best VPN, you must consider several factors:



1.

Server network. A VPN that offers many server locations is your best bet if you want a fast and stable connection. Distance is internet speed’s worst enemy — so always pick a server nearby!

2.

Speed and performance. A good VPN should offer a fast, reliable connection with minimal speed loss. Look for VPN services with optimized software designed to maintain high speeds while encrypting your traffic.

3.

Privacy policy. Privacy is a major concern for most VPN users. Make sure the VPN provider has a strict no-logs policy and doesn’t track what you do online.

4.

Security features. Look for a VPN that offers strong encryption and additional security features to protect your traffic, data, and devices from hackers, malware, and other online threats.

5.

Compatibility and ease of use. Choose a VPN that is compatible with all your devices and is easy to use. What good is a digital service if you need a manual to set it up? Look for a VPN app you can simply install and use.

6.

Customer support. Quality customer support is crucial — you never know when you might need it. Look for a VPN provider that offers 24/7 support and has live chat, email, or phone assistance to help you resolve any issues quickly.

What makes NordVPN one of the best VPNs on the market? 

NordVPN is the most advanced VPN service currently on the market. It has all the basic VPN features you’ve come to expect while also creating and adding new functionalities that no other company offers.




While some users only want to connect to a VPN server and get a new IP address, others enjoy the comprehensive online security NordVPN offers. Meshnet, Dark Web Monitor, and Threat Protection Pro™ — these features make us stand out from the rest. When you combine that with thousands of servers covering 178+ locations worldwide, you can easily understand why anyone who wants to improve their online security would choose NordVPN.

What is the most secure type of VPN encryption? 

The most secure encryption algorithms are AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key) and ChaCha20. AES-256 is considered the gold standard in encryption and is widely used. This algorithm is widely recognized and used by governments, military institutions, and cybersecurity professionals around the world.

What is the best VPN server location? 

The best VPN server location for you depends on proximity and server load. Wherever you are, always choose a server close to you to minimize latency and maximize speed. But while doing so, keep in mind that the server has to have low traffic to ensure better performance and a stable connection. Not sure how to find one? That’s why it’s great to use a service like NordVPN — its apps have a “Quick connect” button that automatically connects you to a fast server that’s closest to you.

Can you change your VPN server location with NordVPN? 

Yes! Open the NordVPN app and select any country you want from the list. It only takes seconds for you to travel to a new virtual location.

Which locations are available on NordVPN? 

NordVPN has physical and virtual servers worldwide — you can choose from 129 countries, 5 continents, and 8,900+ servers among them. Whether it's servers in the USA, UK, Canada, or Australia you’re looking for — we have them (and many more) for you to explore.

Which server locations in the USA does NordVPN offer? 

NordVPN offers 31 server locations in the USA in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. From New York to Miami to Seattle — we’ve got you covered!

Which server locations in the UK does NordVPN offer? 

NordVPN offers four server locations in the UK: Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, and Manchester. Pick your favorite in the app and connect in seconds.

Which server locations in Australia does NordVPN offer? 

NordVPN offers five server locations in Australia: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. Select your preferred location from the list for instant access.

What are the pricing factors for a VPN? 

Several factors influence a VPN’s pricing:




Subscription length. Longer plans often offer lower monthly costs.

Features. Premium features (dedicated IP, obfuscation, threat protection) may increase prices.

Simultaneous connections. More connections allowed at once typically cost more.

Server network size. A larger network with more server locations is more expensive to maintain.

Bandwidth/data limits. Unlimited VPN data will be more expensive.

Customer support. 24/7 support and dedicated teams can add to the cost.

Brand reputation. Trusted brands with strong reputations can have higher prices.

Bundled services. VPNs with additional services (like an antivirus) may charge a premium.

Promotions/discounts. Discounts and promotions can allow you to save money.

Independent audits. Regular third-party audits for transparency may raise the cost.

Why should I choose a paid VPN over a free VPN? 

You should pay to get a better service. It’s difficult for free VPN providers to match the service quality and internet safety a paid provider offers, so you’re more likely to experience slow connections, weak security, and having your device used as a proxy for other customers. If you use a free VPN, its creators have to make money somehow, so they may shower you with ads, track and sell your data, or even use your device to route other people’s traffic through — a reliable paid VPN provider won’t.




With NordVPN, you can rest assured that your private data is protected by cutting-edge encryption so you can experience enhanced online privacy while browsing without VPN restrictions on data and bandwidth. Still not sure? You can try our services and get a full refund within a month of purchase if you’re not satisfied.

Does NordVPN offer special deals? 

Yes! NordVPN has seasonal deals, offering different discounts and special extra benefits for both new and existing users. There are also many special coupons you can use (most likely offered by your favorite YouTuber), and Android users can even test drive NordVPN for free — the first seven days are on us!




All plans come with our 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you’re not sure whether NordVPN is worth your money, you can try it without any risk!
