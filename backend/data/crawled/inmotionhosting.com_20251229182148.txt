What are the different types of web hosting products InMotion Hosting offers?

At InMotion Hosting, we take pride in offering a range of web hosting plans, including expert WordPress solutions, VPS hosting (virtual private servers), Dedicated Servers, and Shared Web Hosting. As industry leading web hosts, we own and operate our servers, which means that we have complete control over their maintenance and operation. However, all the data that you store on our servers belongs to you.

We also offer web hosting platforms purpose-built to support and serve your favorite web applications, frameworks, and content management systems. These web hosting solutions are optimized for the fastest possible performance for your website and tailored to meet the specific server configurations needed of your web apps for an easy and worry-free web hosting experience, such as: Drupal Hosting, Joomla Hosting, OpenCart Hosting, Magento Hosting, PrestaShop Hosting, PHP Hosting, and more.

 

 

Do I really need a host for my website?

Yes, you do need a host for your website. Web hosting is the backbone of your website’s presence on the internet. Think of it as a home for your site — it’s where all your files, data, and content are stored and made accessible to visitors around the world.

A web hosting service provides the server space, along with critical resources like storage, bandwidth, and security tools, ensuring your site runs smoothly and is always accessible. It also assigns your website an IP address and provides tools for DNS management, making it easy for people to find and interact with your site.

Without a website hosting provider, your website simply wouldn’t be visible online. Hosting ensures your site is available 24/7, delivering the seamless connectivity that visitors expect.

 

 

How do I switch website hosting providers?

At InMotion, we make it easy to switch website hosts. Website migration from a different hosting provider is offered at no charge based with certain plans.

We offer a free plugin if you would like to transfer your own WordPress website. If you need assistance, our support team is happy to help with cPanel to cPanel transfers. For a more complicated transfer, our Launch Assist website migration service program can transfer all of your files and databases to your new InMotion Hosting account. Some plans include Launch Assist or you can purchase it through our managed hosting department.

Your data, website, and databases will have a seamless transition with zero downtime. If you are a web guru, you can also migrate your website to your new hosting plan without any assistance.

 

 

How does InMotion's money-back guarantee work if I have prepaid for a year or more?

We strive to provide the best hosting experience, whether you’re joining or leaving InMotion Hosting. That’s why we offer a full money-back guarantee on all web hosting plans, which is tailored to your specific hosting plan and renewal term — 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days.

If you have prepaid yearly, your refund will be prorated based on usage and eligibility. For plans that qualify for our 90-day money-back guarantee, prorated refunds can be requested between 31 and 90 days of your initial term; refunds are not available after the initial 90-day period.

Please note that there are no refunds for addons or Remote KVMs.

You can find all the details about our guarantee in our terms of service.

 

 

Why should I choose InMotion Hosting as my web hosting provider?

When choosing a web hosting provider, it’s important to find a partner that not only meets your technical needs but also supports your long-term online success. InMotion Hosting stands out by offering fast, secure hosting platforms backed by expert support—and now, even more services to help you grow.

InMotion Hosting is the ideal solution for your business if:

You need a fast, high-performance hosting solution: Most of our hosting platforms use NVMe SSDs, delivering your website content in milliseconds for a faster, smoother visitor experience.
You want a reliable hosting solution: Whether you’re launching a short-term project or building a long-term online presence, we offer a range of hosting plans and term lengths to fit your needs.
You value expert, 24/7 customer support: We pride ourselves on offering 24/7 expert human customer support. This means that whenever you need assistance for your web hosting account, a knowledgeable team is ready to address your concerns promptly and effectively.
You want a website hosting company with a proven track record: With over 170,000 customers and decades of experience, we’ve earned our reputation for quality and reliability across all types of businesses.
You want more than just hosting: In addition to hosting, we offer professional Website Design, SEO, and WordPress Maintenance services—making it easy to get online, grow your traffic, and keep your site secure and up to date, all in one place.
