Wolfie's Website -- The Best of the Wolf Home News Bio Hobbies/Interest Pictures Links Reference Forums Welcome to my website! Version 0.2 By some mistake you have stumbled upon my website.  I have been busy lately trying to give this website a much needed overhaul and make it somewhat eye-pleasing, so let me know what you think. :-) Please take a minute to at least let me know if you like the color scheme of the page, I tend to think these colors make for easy reading and you don't have the eye strain from a background of white.  If you would like to tell me what you think of my web page, just chat, or anything else email me at: wolfie's email address. The links on the side  will tell you a little about me and my interests. Everything on this site is copyrighted by me and cannot be reproduced without my written consent.  I take no responsibility for anyone who wants to do something stupid, or does something stupid because of what they read here.  If you are an idiot you deserve what you get!
