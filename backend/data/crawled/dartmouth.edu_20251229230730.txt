Undergraduate Studies

Over 40 departments and programs constitute Dartmouth’s liberal arts core, which promotes critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration among our students. The liberal arts imperative informs every field of study and crosses departments, programs, and schools. Our students learn to ask bigger questions and apply more perspectives to the answers. They gain a deeper understanding of humanity and a broader view of what’s at stake for societies and throughout the world.
