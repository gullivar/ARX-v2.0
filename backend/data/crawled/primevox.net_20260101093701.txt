Fast, efficient, inexpensive and full of features. We dumped ATT and are saving a ton of money. Don't hesitate, sign up with these guys!” Mark James Law Office of J. Gregory Marks “I have been working with the teams from PrimeVox for about five years now. I can only say wonderful things about the service. Switching to them from our former phone company is the best decision the company has ever made. It was made easy by having knowledgeable people that actually care. They have a fantastic response time through email and can always walk me through anything I am having problems with over the phone. Kayla (Account Manager) and Lin (PrimeVox Support) have been there for me quite a few times! Also thank you to everyone else I have delt with over the years.” Patrick Schlauch Buick GMC of Beachwood “Honestly, PrimeVox just works! We roll it out fast, it’s easy for our UPS clients to use, and I don’t get phone calls about phone calls anymore.” Doug Fennell C2C Technology Group “Working with the PrimeVox team has been an awesome experience! They are focused on providing excellent customer service and their cloud-based software is powerful, easy to use and tailored to your business needs. They are friendly, knowledgeable and always quick to respond. I’d absolutely recommend them to anyone needing VoIP services.” Casey Christian Keaton Interiors “From our initial introduction I could tell there was something special about PrimeVox and the members of its staff. Time and time again they have delivered an exceptional product at a truly high valued, low cost. They are professional, prompt and utterly will bend over backwards to provide customer service. Never has it been this easy and straightforward working with a Telecom provider. Their knowledge is second to none, pair that with a desire to deliver and achieve excellence in this field, and making the transition is a no brainer. I refer ALL of my friends, coworkers and fellow business alike to PrimeVox for these exact reasons.” Dillon DeVolk Mastertech Auto Care "We have used PrimeVox VoIP phones and service for the last two years at our preschool. Huge savings, no downtime and very responsive customer service. We can't recommend them enough." Seth Van Eyk Kids R Kids Las Colinas "This company has been amazing to work with since our initial integration. The support at PrimeVox is one of the best support teams I've ever worked with. They're fast, efficient, and can always solve our problem. Even in the middle of a snow storm they were answering calls and making sure our phones were up and running the way we needed them to." Samantha Chong Allied Health Agency “The customer service is unmatched and having the same number as my phone and fax number has made things so much easier. I could also go on and on about the ease of use and benefit of using the mobile app to streamline a bunch of our processes with our main line. PrimeVox is a must have service for any successful practice.” Dr. Josh Bonine, DC South Texas Spine & Knee “I can’t say enough good things about PrimeVox! It’s the fourth service I’ve tried after countless frustrations with other VoIP systems, and the first one that finally works seamlessly with my clinic.No one beats their pricing, and they literally do the work for you! My patients didn’t even realize I switched — PrimeVox handled everything, including setting up my voicemail and auto messages. The transition was unbelievably smooth. Best of all, when I have a question, I get to speak with a real human! PrimeVox is HIPAA compliant and by far the easiest VoIP service I’ve ever used. I highly recommend them, especially for healthcare offices.” Dr. Nicole Uomoto Renewed Strength Chiropractic “I was initially hesitant to leave my former provider, but switching to PrimeVox Communications has been the best decision for my business. My concerns around porting numbers, keeping our message-on-hold, after-hours call pass-throughs, and updating menu voices were all handled seamlessly. Having quick, simple access to U.S.-based support was imperative in my decision, and PrimeVox has exceeded expectations. Their customer service is the epitome of how a business should be run; prompt, professional, and truly focused on the customer.” Dr. David Adler Adler Comprehensive Chiropractic Get started today and elevate your communication with effortless solutions!
