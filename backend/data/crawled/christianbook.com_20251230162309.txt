About Christianbook

From humble beginnings in 1978, two brothers - a 19-year-old Bible college freshman and a 14-year-old high schooler - sold a few discounted academic titles to fellow students and pastors from their parents' home. Orders poured in, and the small house's driveway, bedrooms, and garage overflowed with boxes of books. After four decades of continued dedication to selection, savings, and service, Christianbook now has more than 600 employees and 500,000 Christian products in a 370,000-square-foot facility.
