How remote desktop software works?

The term "remote desktop connection" means remote access to another PC via remote desktop software, like AeroAdmin. The software is run on both PCs and then a connection between them is established. Remote desktop software grabs a display image of the remote PC, processes it in a special optimized way and translates it to the local computer of an operator.

All keyboard and mouse signals are communicated from the operator to the client pc, and the latter interprets these signals as if they are being inputted right on this local pc by a person.

Before image and control signal data is sent to a remote PC and vice versa, a secure encrypted connection is set up, so that no third party will be able to decrypt and use it.
