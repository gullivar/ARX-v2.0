Do Xuan Hung, DBA from Golden Gate University Career Acceleration AGM Finance  at Regent Garment Factory Limited Explore Course The program's ease of use truly made lifelong learning a reality. Michael Onuorah, DBA in Emerging Technologies from Golden Gate University Knowledge and Skill Enhancement Data Engineer at MS247 Tech Cooperation Explore Course Testimonials: Letters from our learners Discover the impact of our quality from the community Learners Michael Murray LinkedIn Doctor of Education Learner, Edgewood University The Ed D isn't just for those in traditional education roles. It's a highly practical program, ideal for professionals in many different organisations, as well as educational leadership. This program can be completed in just 24 months, focusing on real-world applications rather than theory. It covers vital areas like leadership and education, policy development and market forces that are essential in driving innovation and change. One of the key advantages of the program is its structure. Rather than having large end of course assessments, the program is built on micro assessments and progressively builds your grades over the two years by the time you begin your thesis. You'll already have 2/3 of your grades completed. This makes the entire process far more manageable compared to a PhD, where you will, for money, find yourself lost along with research projects. In the end, each assessment builds towards your thesis, so you're constantly working towards it. Read Full Story Kanon Clifford LinkedIn DBA Learner, Golden Gate University I'm a lawyer at Bourgeron Clifford, a top 10 personal injury law firm in Canada. My interests lie at the intersection of business, law, and technology. Through upGrad, I'm able to get access to Golden Gate University's DBA program, where all three of those subjects are at front and center. I was looking for a program that could build on something with a higher level skill set than what I currently have, and something that pushes me to learn to implement new academic theories at work, something that's accessible, and something that's affordable. Three things that stand out about upGrad to me are, one, they're weekly live lectures and seminars that help you understand the practicality of topics you learn in theory. Number two, upGrad buddies that push your boundaries to complete the course, submit assignments on time, and do everything together. Third, the career mentors in your field of study periodically share great tips with you that you'd never have anywhere else. The program has allowed me to continue working while attending school and has allowed me to seek my next academic challenge and to immerse myself in doctoral-level business education. Read Full Story Jacqueline LinkedIn DBA Learner, Golden Gate University When I went for this, I could see that there was that level of dedication and commitment by the university in wanting to ensure that the students would be achieving the necessary education level that they need in sitting and reading for their doctoral degree in itself. Now, as a knowledge hound, this is something that is important to me, the validity and the validation. But over and above that, I would say that the touch points that have been created by upGrad and GGU for the learner have been very good, a very well laid out student portal. Everything is in sequence of what we need to do, the instructions are clear, and In addition to all of that, there are also live sessions where we actually have lessons to contextualize, to formalize the online learning that we are doing on, you know, our own time. And yes, they are responsive. They don't leave us hanging, which helps with the learning experience.

We have always strived to facilitate quality education to the upcoming workforce through industry-relevant UG and PG programs. Staying Dynamic and Forward-Looking From being incepted in 2015 to teaching a learner base of 10k+ in 2018 to crossing the 1M mark in 2020 - upGrad has always focused on staying dynamic and future-centric. This approach has helped us grow as an organization while catering best-in-class learning to our students. In 2021, upGrad became a unicorn with a valuation of $1.2B, expanding to North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific. Only onwards and upwards from here! Growing and Expanding Constantly Growth has been our true constant in this journey. Whether it is entering the unicorn club or winning the Best Career Planning platform award, or being ranked the #1 startup in India per LinkedIn's 2020 report - we've always strived to go above and beyond our current capacities and bring novel ideas to the table for the betterment of learners across the globe.
