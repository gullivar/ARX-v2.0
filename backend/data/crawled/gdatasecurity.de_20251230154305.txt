G DATA BootMedium

The G DATA boot medium is a practical aid for detecting viruses that have already embedded themselves on your computer prior to installing the antivirus software. The download file is an ISO file, i.e. it must either be burnt to a CD/DVD or be mounted via a virtual drive so it can be used from a USB stick for example. You can download the boot medium in the "Tools" download area.

G DATA FakeAVCleaner "System Tool"

The G DATA FakeAVCleaner “System Tool” removes FakeAV of the “System Tool” type and related types. Note: The G DATA FakeAVCleaner “System Tool” has to be executed with the Windows user account that is infected. As the FakeAV “System Tool” shuts down all user-initiated programs which do not have any kind of ‘reserved’ name, like explorer.exe, winlogon.exe or svchost.exe and many more, the file name for the G DATA FakeAVCleaner is svchost.exe.


Download
Mon Activity CS

The MonActivity tool enables you to monitor the activity of the AVK-guard in the background. This can be helpful to analyze performance problems. You can run this tool in real time during "normal" activity, and then try to reproduce the problem. Or you can run it for half an hour with the hitlist function and then refresh the view to see if a specific process pops up all the time. Defining an exception for a specific type of files might solve the problem in that case.


Download
Quarantine Generation 2011

This version is for G DATA products of generation 2011 and later. This tool enables you to work with files that have been placed in quarantine. These quarantined files have the extension *.q and can be found on the client in the folder "C:\ > Program files > Common files > G DATA > AVKScanner > QBase" or on the server in "C:\ > Program files > G DATA > AVK ManagementServer > QBase". You can for example place infected mail archives into a new folder and continue working.

G DATA USB Keyboard Guard

The G DATA USB Keyboard Guard is an add-on that protects you from the most likely form of USB attack: USB devices pretending to be keyboards. If a new keyboard is detected by the system, access is initially denied and a pop-up is displayed. You can then check in your own time whether this really is a keyboard, and either grant or deny access permanently. You can download the software for free.
