UNIC Stories Inspiring stories and testimonials from UNIC students and alumni. Rhaam Rozenberg When I initially began my Bachelor’s degree I was not exactly sure what path I wanted to follow, the different courses I got to take gave me the chance to discover different varied areas of computer science. Eventually, I found my interest to be in data science, AI, and machine learning. This led me to where I am now. I am really happy with what I have learned and am still learning thanks to some of the great professors that I had along the way. If I was given a chance to do it all again I would do it the same way. Anna Rangelova Director Client Service, Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience, Nielsen, Geneva, Switzerland Education is not preparation for life. It is life itself. However, while education is a never-ending process, it is the foundations I acquired at UNIC that made the difference for me. I learned! I think BIG! What about you? Dr Foivos Koulaidis Looking back, I can now safely say that the MD programme prepared me extremely well throughout my six years of study. It provided the necessary knowledge and skills that gave me confidence while dealing with patients and proceeding methodically from a patient history 
and physical examination to the appropriate differential diagnosis and treatment plan. Rafaella Georgiou Permanent Mission of the Republic of Cyprus to the United Nations The knowledge and experiences I acquired as a student at the University definitely shaped me as both an individual and a professional. Due to its geographical position and rich history, Cyprus is a truly unique place, ideal for studying International Relations. Indeed, this has 
given me a great advantage in my current position, where I get to apply all I have learnt during my studies. I am a very proud UNIC graduate!
