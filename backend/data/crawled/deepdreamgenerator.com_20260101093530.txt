                        (3.69 MP) Used settings: Prompt : The rhythm of life: There's no one else who needs to know. She tells herself, oh Memories back when she was bold and strong and waiting for the world to come along. Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone.  A masterful charcoal and wet on wet ink rendering unveils an elegant biomechanical hyper-realistic woman, captured mid-performance. Her slender torso merges seamlessly with the resonant body of a cello, forged from polished obsidian and adorned with luminous silver filigree. Delicate limbs formed of brass and bone clockwork extend with poised precision, while translucent tubes glow faintly with amber light, echoing the rhythm of living veins. She sits with her legs wrapped around the cello motionless on a desolate, darkened stage, her figure isolated beneath a single dramatic spotlight. The visual language evokes the anatomical precision of a lost Leonardo da Vinci study entwined with the grotesque refinement of H.R. Giger. Intricate cross-hatching, exquisite chiaroscuro, and meticulous detail elevate the sketch into a haunting fusion of art and machinery.

                        (19.98 MP) Used settings: Prompt : Hybrid 50% animal 50% plant: cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) x cherry (Prunus avium)
Full width 16:9 illustration filling the entire image width of an orchard with a close-up on a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) x cherry (Prunus avium) hybrid. The hybrid has the shape of a cherry tree hung with abundant red male cardinal cherry fruit, with yellow cardinal beaks, black cardinal eyes and scarlet feathers. The fruit is shown close-up, surrounded by dark-green, veined cherry leaves. The beautiful hybrid rises solitary from a grassy orchard with long stems of grass waving in the summer wind. At the upper edge of the image, the sky is azure blue and is filled with strongly patterned cumulus clouds. The image is executed in an appealing jumble of very tiny, extremely intricate, elaborate, decorative patterns and scribbles as well as some very tiny low-poly elements in the feathers of the cardinal cherry fruit as well as the cherry leaves. The hybrids stand out very strongly against the ornate, highly textured background with its appealing, tiny patterns. The entire image is rendered in very rich, vibrant, ultra-detailed colors in intense pen-and-colored-ink technique with high color contrast. The fully melded biological oddity is illustrated with painstaking precision in a detailed biology illustration style. Astonishing, impossible hybrid, extremely detailed, intricate illustration.

                        (3.70 MP) Used settings: Prompt : A graceful and powerful goddess in a dynamic pose, rendered in Japanese ink-splash art on rice paper, dressed in a suductive ornate Chinese outfit, sensually sits on a couch. The scene is rendered with a prominent, multi-layered impasto texture and gestural brushstrokes creating a sense of movement, akin to abstract realism and expressionism. Muted, dark tones dominate the palette, with subtle tonal variations and densities of brushstrokes creating depth. A diffused, cool light source casts a mysterious shade. The ink work features subtle gradients and intricate, fractal-like details. Pearlescent accents contrast with deep blacks, adding an otherworldly glow. Balanced composition with elegant, restrained color highlights. Inspired by the abstract, sculptural and expressive qualities of artists like Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning.

It brought Google's revolutionary DeepDream neural network technology to the public through a simple web interface—allowing anyone to create AI-generated art without coding or technical skills. While earlier AI art projects existed—such as Harold Cohen's AARON program from 1973—Deep Dream Generator was the first platform to make generative AI art accessible to everyone online. Users could simply upload an image and watch as neural networks transformed it into surreal, dream-like artwork. Today, Deep Dream Generator continues to evolve, offering 30+ AI models, text-to-image generation, and video creation capabilities—a far cry from its pioneering origins, but still true to its mission as the original AI art website. How long has Deep Dream Generator been around? Since 2015—making us one of the first generative AI art platforms on the web, predating tools like Midjourney and DALL-E by many years. Who created Deep Dream Generator? DDG was created by Kaloyan Chernev in 2015, making it one of the earliest generative AI art platforms on the web. The team is located in Sofia, Bulgaria.
