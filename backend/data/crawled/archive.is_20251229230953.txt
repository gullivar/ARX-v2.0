My url is alive and I want to archive its content
Archive.today is a time capsule for web pages!
It takes a 'snapshot' of a webpage that will always be online even if the original page disappears.
It saves a text and a graphical copy of the page for better accuracy
and provides a short and reliable link to an unalterable record of any web page
including those from Web 2.0 sites:
https://archive.is/2020.04.21/rt.live/
https://archive.is/2014.06.26/google.com/maps/…
This can be useful if you want to take a 'snapshot' of a page which could change soon: price list, job offer, real estate listing, drunk blog post, ...
Saved pages will have no active elements and no scripts, so they keep you safe as they cannot have any popups or malware!
I want to search the archive for saved snapshots
search queries by example
microsoft.comfor snapshots from the host microsoft.com
*.microsoft.comfor snapshots from microsoft.com and all its subdomains (e.g. www.microsoft.com)
http://twitter.com/burgerkingfor snapshots from exact url (search is case-sensitive)
http://twitter.com/burg*for snapshots from urls starting with http://twitter.com/burg
