CUSTOMER STORY
Aspro Parks, responding instantly to thousands of customers
Javier Torrecilla. Marketing & Sales.
The big challenge of online sales: Don't die answering repetitive questions.

We’re telling you this because we see it every day. We want to help you solve a problem that’s surely affecting you, just like thousands of our customers.

The overload burnout from emails, calls, and WhatsApp messages from leads always asking the same things.

Does any of this sound familiar?
You added a WhatsApp button to your website thinking it would bring you more sales… but all you got is more stress and constant distractions.damn button
You get a lot of traffic, and your leads keep asking the same questions because they’re lost, they don’t know what they want, or they don’t even remember how they ended up on your site.
Your phone keeps ringing nonstop, you get emails and WhatsApp messages even outside office hours. Your sales team is overwhelmed and can barely close any deals.
You invest in ad campaigns and don’t want to waste money or lose leads. They land on your site, ask a question, but if you don’t reply fast enough, they move on to the next ad.
You see that red notification bubble on WhatsApp and feel dizzy just thinking about it — answering one by one, and there’s no way you can keep up with it all.
Your visitors need instant attention with clear, quick answers — and if they don’t feel taken care of within 10 seconds, they’ll move on to your competitors.
I want to automate my support now
If you’re still handling chats manually, one by one… this is for you
Joinchat is a conversational assistant specially designed for WordPress, built to give you extra time every day. This bundle integrates AI-powered conversational assistants that handle up to 80% of inquiries on autopilot 24/7, plus Chat Funnels that persuade, qualify, and guide each lead exactly where they need to go. We also include a set of proven templates from real clients — sales flows that:
Qualify and segment opportunities
They store your personal data and interests.
They handle objections while you focus on closing the sale.

All this without losing control:

You still have the contact
You are still the one who decides how and when to join the conversation.
You let the system do the heavy lifting.
Web traffic doesn't have a schedule. Neither do leads. Campaigns never stop. Neither does your website support.
You do stop. You rest. You live.
You are happy
