Understand data everywhere

The Data Command Graph maps all your data—structured, unstructured, primary, and secondary—and provides rich context by connecting it to every identity, AI model, and system that touches it across its lifecycle.

Bring dark data into the light. Spot hidden exposure, cut ROT data, and operate with precision with one source of truth.

Secure data and AI
Make data, identity, and AI resilient
Unleash the value of data for AI
The risks shaping your business aren’t siloed anymore

Veeam gives you a unified foundation to understand your exposure and recover operations with confidence.

0%

of ransomware attacks now exfiltrate data.

0%

of enterprise data is unstructured and largely unmapped.

0%

of organizations lack a dedicated plan to address generative AI risks.

How resilient is the data your AI depends on?

The Data Resilience Maturity Model (DRMM) is the framework for measuring trust in your data, proof in your controls, and confidence in your recovery.

See how your organization stacks up in the age of AI.
