Site Updates: Feb 8 2022 - Apr 3 2023
Apr 3 2023 by Kevin
Greetings,

It's been quite some time since that last update so lets have a quick recap. Over the past 13 months we have completed quite a bit of development involving site features and fixes. One of the more recent and substantial updates is finally being able to add support for Push Notifications on iOS 16.4+. Please take a look at the new guide to get your phone connected and receiving notifications even when your safari browser is closed! Our d2jsp mod team has also evolved over the past year, with 33 promotions, 17 retirements and 14 new trusted tags handed out. Since the last update we have also seen 4 Ladder Slasher ladder resets. Take a look at the Ladder Slasher portal for all the updates: https://ladderslasher.d2jsp.org/

We are looking forward to the Diablo IV launch on June 6 with early access going out to those who pre-purchased it on June 2nd. We already have a forum setup for it. Additionally we have created a D4 Trading forum and will make the necessary adjustments by adding additional forums and post tags as required once the game is launched.

Site Updates: Sep 1 2021 - Feb 7 2022
Feb 7 2022 by Kevin
Hello everyone!

With 2022 in full swing we felt it was time once again to post an update of what has happened since we last shared. Over the last five months there has been tremendous growth and activity within our community. On the d2jsp staff side we've gone through 25 staff promotions, 5 staff retirements and have added 13 new trusted members. We have also been hard at work improving the community and the overall user experience through over 100 site updates, changes and new features. The full list of updates and changes can be found below.

The record on the fastest Ladder Slasher reset was set, where bdan reset the Softcore Ladder in 8 days, 22 hours and 15 minutes. For those of you who are not familiar with Ladder Slasher, it is a free RPG game that you can play in your web browser, on your desktop or mobile device. I encourage you to check it out if you haven't done so.

With the release of Diablo 2:Resurrected we saw an explosion of activity shattering our online user record to over 30,000 simultaneous online users. This activity was responsible for over 6.2 million trade topics composed just shy of 21.5 million posts. With the announcement of patch 2.4 we have quite a bit to look forward to such as Ladder Rank Play, Class Balance Changes, Mercenary Changes & New Rune Words! You can find all the details in the announcement here: https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo2/23746135/diablo-ii-resurrected-patch-2-4-highlights-coming-soon. Here are the official ptr patch notes if you're interested: https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo2/23765907/diablo-ii-resurrected-patch-2-4-balance-ptr We have been told to expect the first ever Ladder Rank play to start early in 2022 and are very excited!

With the trading brought to us from Diablo 2:Resurrected we are happy to announce a complete rewrite and launch of our free, safe and secure trade mediation service. We have been able to get the wait times down to an average of one minute from request to first contact. This would have never been possible without the amazing support of our staff and mediators. We thank you for all of your continued help in keeping trades safe and secure. If you haven't yet used our free mediation service we highly encourage you to check it out. It's as simple as one click at the top of your trade topic to ensure fast, safe and secure trades. There is some more information on this free service in the site article: How To Request A Mediator And Prevent Scams.

As promised here is a full list of all changes since the last update:
