What can Grafana Cloud help you do?
Troubleshoot faster

Contextual alerts integrated into Grafana Cloud’s workflows for application, Kubernetes, and infrastructure observability – and more – speed up root cause analysis.

At BlackRock, this “put our telemetry into action and ultimately resolved issues faster,” Head of Observability Olin Gay said at ObservabilityCON.

Reduce telemetry costs

Using machine learning under the hood, the Adaptive Telemetry features aggregate unused metrics and optimize log volumes.

“It not only saves us hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but it’s also a forcing function for us to look closely at our metrics to find additional opportunities for time series reduction and cardinality improvements,” said Mux Senior Engineering Manager Ron Lipke.

Manage your incident response, all in Grafana Cloud

The IRM solution provides workflows to create alerts and SLOs, manage on-call and incident response, and learn from postmortems – all within the context of your observability stack.

“Getting on-call notifications and paging integrated closer to the dashboards and data that help developers diagnose and resolve issues will greatly improve on-call workflows,” said The Trade Desk Staff Software Engineer Nathan Bellowe.
