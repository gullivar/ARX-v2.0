YTMND's anniversary is coming up this week.  Also, the world is being plunged into chaos, millions of people are stuck inside with nothing to do other than dick around on the internet, and the last few weeks have provided me with ample time to narrow my focus. So welcome back. The first thing I'd like to do is thank the patreons without whom likely would never have happened. While patreon donations aren't paying for my labor or the site's hardware in any meaningful way, they are paying for the hosting, and more importantly, it showed me that there are a diverse group of people out there who care about preserving the site enough to throw some money at it. They're the reason you won't see ads on the site. Read More 155 comments UP AND COMING ? Luthor: PART 1 ? Angus! ? Luther: PART 3 ? When The Hulk Come To Heaven&... ? Convict Jeopardy! ?
