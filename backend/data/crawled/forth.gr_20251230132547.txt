Research Highlights
NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captures first-ever images of asteroid collisions around nearby star

Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have captured the first direct images of catastrophic asteroid collisions in another planetary system — a discovery that provides unique insight into how planets form and evolve. The new data comes from observations of the nearby star Fomalhaut, located 25 light-years from Earth. The study was recently published in the prestigious journal Science.

Μosquito vectors of malaria rapidly develop resistance against new generation insecticides

The Molecular Entomology group of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB) of FORTH, led by John Vontas, Professor at the Agricultural University of Athens, has a longstanding expertise and reputation in the delineation of insecticide resistance mechanisms in malaria vectors and agricultural pests. The current study, published in the prestigious journal Nature Communications, was led by Dr. Sofia Balaska and Dr. Linda Grigoraki at IMBB-FORTH as main authors, and was carried out in close collaboration with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK, revealing a novel carboxylesterase-mediated mechanism of cross-resistance to insecticides in Anopheles gambiae.
