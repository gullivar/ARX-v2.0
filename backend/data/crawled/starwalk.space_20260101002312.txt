Jase Parnell-Brookes, space.com The original Star Walk remains one of the best apps for budding stargazers of all levels, but Star Walk 2 has added some excellent features for night-time jaunts. It will identify the location of stars, planets, meteors and nebulae, the International Space Station and comets. Point it at the sky and you’ll soon be marvelling at the cosmos. Stuart Dredge, The Guardian Star Walk 2 is an augmented reality app which can easily be adapted for educational purposes. It is a stargazing app intended to enhance your stargazing experience, and it certainly does just that. My recommendation for using the Star Walk 2 app in instructional design or education would be to use it for a supplemental activity while teaching astronomy.
