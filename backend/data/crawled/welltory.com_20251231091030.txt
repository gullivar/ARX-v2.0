Get the app 20 times Featured by App Store 2024 winner Product leader of the year Reviews Best fitness application. PERIOD This application has saved my life on multiple times, or should I say occasions. It has alerted me to conditions that I was not aware of, and made me more cautious of paying attention to signs and being consistent in paying attention to those signs. The accuracy of the application itself is unheard of as the algorithm itself has been highly regarded as potentially life-saving and strictly accurate. When I go to my doctors appointments twice a month for pain management and my cardiologists, they both use this application. Dre Fessha Fresh May 24, 2023 Still a most favorite app This thing is a powerful tool, not just a playful app. Have been working with it for almost two yrs, 11/20, on annual subscription. It is an exceptional coach and personal trainer day by day and moment by moment. Have a chronic disabling condition, which makes it very difficult to know when it is safe to push and when it is not. Finally there is objective over subjective help. The advice given, all the articles and biometrics, are invaluable. Thank you Welltory. Ones Imus August 22, 2022 App So good, I referred it to my Dr. & RN My Mom just got out of the hospital and Im taking care of her. I wanted something to manage her health and mine. So, I can see her sleep, heart rate and stress! This app is hands down the best!! I even told the RN and Primary care Dr all about it and showed it to them. This app has been proven scientifically through rigorous tests and it is more than accurate. This app has been proven scientifically through rigorous tests and it is more than accurate.
