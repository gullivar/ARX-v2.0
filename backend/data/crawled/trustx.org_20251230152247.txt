“THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE FOR ADVERTISERS AND AGENCIES is how easily they can buy clean and clear inventory directly from the world’s most trusted publishers. Buyers are managing thousands of line items. They are looking for an open exchange without reseller exposure and without all the risks, costs and complexity. That’s why they need TRUSTX.”
