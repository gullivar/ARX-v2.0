Extremely easy to use Love the email to app feature. The Today list keeps me focused by keep the clutter away yet every todo that I think of is in the app. Kudos. The best todo app I’ve ever used. Btw, text to app would be awesome Raissa Fedora 5,0 Finally i got task manager app / calendar that fit like a glove! Telegram bot integration, nested task, 2way google cal integration, multiplatform, BRAIN DUMP section, and better yet, non intimidating UI. Bravo! alif_ant 5,0 My favorite productivity app iPhoneZombies 5,0 I have tried all the major task managers, but none handle recurring tasks as effectively as Singularity. I have numerous recurring tasks that I often need to reschedule. While most task managers allow for this flexibility, they also adjust the next occurrence based on the modified completion time, which isn’t accurate. I need the next instance to regenerate based on the original schedule, not the last adjusted time. Singularity is the only tool that meets this requirement perfectly. Karapotamus 5,0 I have been looking for the One True App to be my chaos-and-entropy management system…and this app is doing the job! It is simple, beautiful, and intuitive…but still has all of the features I need. I love the ease of managing the hierarchy in my various projects…I love that I can add notes on projects (I use this space for goals). The tags and filters are great, I love the colors I can assign to projects, I love the habits feature and the pomodoro feature. Todoist was the closest competitor, but Singularity won my attention and the investment of my time. Thanks, guys, keep up the good work!!! :) Brynn Pace 5,0 Incredible app! After the free trial, I was sold! I'm not the best at time management, but with the calendar view, it helps me visualize all my tasks as well as move things around on my schedule easily. They updated and fixed a problem when I reached out to them and now the Google Calendar sync is perfect. And they continually roll out incredible improvements. Honestly, it's everything I've ever wanted in a task management app. ❤️👌🏼🎉💯 Danil Tormin 5,0 Best project management app. Best features: 1) Print and scan your day plan 2) Synchronise calendars 3) Nesting of projects The developers also have many ideas for improving the app, which you can see and vote for on the website jadore_toi 5,0 easy and strong, highly recommend James.Taylor82 5,0 I think, this is the Best Task Manager App!
