I used to regularly follow the youtube videos, prelims booster videos and specially editorial discussion from where I made important pointers. I also watched some history videos like Buddhism, Jainism as the topics were explained very clearly… all these were very helpful during my preparation…

I am Raja Majhi, and I am thrilled to share that I have secured All India Rank 1 (AIR 1) in the GATE 2024 examination in ECE. From the very beginning, Physics Wallah stood out for its structured and comprehensive curriculum. The faculty members, with their in-depth knowledge and teaching expertise, ensured that every concept was crystal clear. GATE Wallah not only provided academic support but also fostered a positive and encouraging learning environment. The online resources, interactive sessions, and community forums allowed me to connect with fellow aspirants and learn collaboratively.
