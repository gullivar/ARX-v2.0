“We’re fully committed to Domotz. If it disappeared tomorrow, I can’t imagine going back to the way we worked before. Thankfully, Domotz has become such an integral part of our workflow that we don’t have to worry about that.”

Kevin White

CEO, TRINUS Tech

“Before Domotz, we’d realize a device existed only when something went wrong, or worse, when a client told us. Now we see it all, the moment it shows up.”

Rex Cooper
