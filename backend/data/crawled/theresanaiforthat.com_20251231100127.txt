Pet portraits Open Cheng Zhang 🛠️ 1 tool 🙏 1 karma Dec 25, 2025 @Pet2AI My daughter Abigail created a dragon story, and I used AI to help her visualize the text into a cartoon storybook.

That simple moment changed everything. Watching her eyes light up when she saw her words transformed into beautiful, AI-style illustrations made me realize: every child deserves this opportunity.

We decided to build an app to share what we learned—and to empower more kids to do innovative work by creating AI images and AI stories. Because when kids can bring their imagination to life, magic happens.

And here's what we discovered: their pets and friends make the best characters for stories. Kids already love their pets. They already have wild imaginations. What if we could combine both?

pet2ai was born from that vision. We make it easy for any child—or parent—to create fully illustrated storybooks starring their pets, friends, or custom characters. No artistic skills needed. No weeks of waiting. Just pure creativity, powered by AI.

Every story teaches positive values, celebrates friendship and adventure, and most importantly—makes kids excited about reading and storytelling. We're not just generating stories; we're sparking innovation, creativity, and a love for bringing ideas to life.

Just like Abigail's dragon story became real, we want every child to see their imagination come alive. Because every kid has an Amethyst waiting to be illustrated. 1 Reply Share Edit Delete Report Share Released 5d ago Free + from $4.99 198 4 5.0 SniffSub Analyze subreddits to find your target audience.

After years of refining its audio source separation technology through multiple generations of neural networks, LALAL.AI introduces Andromeda — its most advanced and meticulously engineered model to date. Trained on expanded datasets, driven by deeper audio pattern analysis, and fine‑tuned for maximum separation accuracy, Andromeda sets a new benchmark for quality in vocal isolation and stem separation.

This model reflects the culmination of six generations of research in digital signal processing and machine learning. Each iteration built upon the insights of the previous one, distilling everything learned from millions of processed tracks and thousands of user feedback cycles worldwide. The result is a model that delivers both greater speed and precision, achieving up to 40% faster processing while significantly enhancing the clarity of extracted stems.

Andromeda, like the previous LALAL.AI neural network Perseus, operates using transformer technology, which helps it analyze and separate complex audio more accurately. The new network processes tracks faster than the predecessor and maintains strong separation quality, handling vocals, instruments, and background sounds with improved precision.

Andromeda works by carefully separating audio layers to reduce common issues in AI separation, such as vocal bleed into other instruments, unwanted reverb, and loss of clarity in high frequencies. Instead of just looking at the sound as one simple waveform, Andromeda studies it in different ways — by time, frequency, and tone.

In practice, this means it doesn’t just detect “the voice” or “the drums”; instead, it registers timbre composition, resonance depth, and instrument presence across the stereo field. This kind of separation used to require manual cleanup in a digital audio workstation. With Andromeda, many of those post‑processing steps are now unnecessary. Even quiet elements, like soft backing vocals, come out sharper and easier to mix.

The Andromeda network is now integrated into several LALAL.AI web services: 

Stem Splitter (for Vocal and Instrumental + Voice and Noise stems)
Lead & Back Vocal Splitter
Echo & Reverb Remover
Voice Cleaner
Each of these tools benefits from Andromeda’s enhanced processing capabilities, allowing users to extract cleaner stems, reduce noise, and isolate vocals more effectively than before. 2 1 Share 🇨🇭 Switzerland Released 6d ago From $10/mo 15,562 91 3.5 Artta AI Affordable AI platform for creating videos and images.

Improved Invoices for Compliance

Invoices now include full company details, making accounting, audits, and compliance simpler and more transparent.

Faster Access & Improved Navigation
Simplified Control Center

We’ve streamlined and accelerated access to the Control Center, reducing friction and helping you get where you need faster—whether you’re managing projects, settings, or AI tools.

I'm going to follow this and see how it evolves. For now, i managed to create quite a nice Expenses app for personal use. |

It did have some problems when it came to moving some components on other pages, but for how short the prompts it uses can be, it is really impressive. With some proper prompts it can generate some strong stuff. 85 9 Reply Share Edit Delete Report Share Released 1y ago Free + from $29/mo 66,532 630 4.5 View all 3817 AIs 2023 PixieBrix Accelerate Work with AI Customer support Open 37,288 www.pixiebrix.com Share Released 2y ago No pricing 44,656 299 5.0 Osum Supercharge Your Market Research With AI ⚡ Market research Open Osum 🛠️ 1 tool 🙏 337 karma Mar 1, 2024 @Osum Hi thanks for pointing this out, we've checked and can confirm that the thing is in fact doing the thing 🫡 66 3 Reply Share Edit Delete Report Share Released 2y ago Free + from $119.99 20,609 686 3.8 Venturekit Generate comprehensive AI business plans instantly Business plans Open Dawson Whitfield 🛠️ 1 tool 🙏 616 karma Nov 27, 2023 @Venturekit A little biased, but I think it's great. 56 7 Reply Share Edit Delete Report Share Released 2y ago From $8/mo 39,953 981 2.1 Photo AI Create beautiful AI photos and videos of real people Images Open Arvoly XSL 🙏 121 karma Oct 31, 2023 @Photo AI It's not free, it forces you to input an email before shoving a price tag in your face. 60 40 Reply Share Edit Delete Report Share Released 2y ago From $9/mo 241,528 2,562 2.5 View all 4935 AIs 2022 MyReport Automating data collection and citation for your reports.

Writing Open Shawn Vybiral 🙏 62 karma Jun 7, 2024 @lxi.ai This could be a really great service that I would love to have.  The way it creates documents would be perfect for the philosophical doctrine I'm writing but unfortantilly I couldn't use this because of the hotkey setup.  I am very use to pressing CTRL Backspace to backspace by word instead of character and its ingraned in me.  Its the hotkey that deletes a node on the canvas so I was deleting my nodes every time I wanted to change a word.  There needs to be a way to disable the hotkey.  I tried finding a way to email the developer but I couldn't find anything.  Based on the idea I would give this 5stars but in its current state I cant use it.  Eventually the whole thing locked up on me and I couldn't interact with the canvas in anyway. 55 5 Reply Share Edit Delete Report Share Released 4y ago No pricing 9,798 139 Tinq NLP text analysis and rewriting.

Signing up took under a minute and because I offer a very specific set of services as a consultant, I didn't expect the AI to be able to capture my work, but it did a great job with creating content for me. I only had to make a few edits, add my bio, and was able to publish that same day. Now I get lots of compliments on my site and I've even tried their other tools like email marketing, which is great because the emails match my site's appearance. Overall I would recommend B12 as an effective, affordable, and easy to use website solution. 89 11 Reply Share Edit Delete Report Share Released 7y ago Free + from $42/mo 153,204 1,637 3.4 remove.bg Remove image backgrounds in 5 seconds with one click Background removal Open 5,412 www.remove.bg Fabio Ferraris 🙏 88 karma Sep 4, 2024 @remove.bg It works!
