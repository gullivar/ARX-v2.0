What is ETH?

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network, used to pay transaction fees and secure the blockchain through staking.

Beyond its technical role, ETH is open, programmable digital money. It is used for global payments, as collateral for loans, and as a store of value that doesn't rely on any central entity.
