For this reason, we are the only ones in control over the usage of our Hetzner servers in the data centers in Ashburn and Hillsboro. At both locations, we provide AMD-based cloud servers and cloud features. The Ashburn location is in a region nicknamed "Data Center Alley", which is one of the most highly trafficked regions in North America. The Hillsboro location is in a region nicknamed "Silicon Forest", and is also already known for an exceptional network, making our proximity to both locations ideal. We operate Hetzner Cloud products in Singapore on Hetzner’s own servers in third-party data centers. With this first location in the Asia-Pacific region, we are expanding our offering and ensuring low latency for even more customers. Data security is our top priority. That’s why only we are using our own servers in Singapore. In Singapore our shared and dedicated VPS with AMD processors and cloud features are available. The location in the heart of Asia enables fast connections to important markets such as China, India and Japan. With a sophisticated network infrastructure and numerous international submarine cable connections, Singapore offers exceptionally high data speeds and excellent connectivity throughout the Asia-Pacific region. FEATURES Load Balancer Load Balancers let you scale your applications easily by automatically distributing traffic across your infrastructure. Handle common use-cases like TLS termination or create an internet-facing entry point to route traffic into your Hetzner Cloud Networks. Primary IPs Assign Primary IPs to your server to establish a connection to the internet. Or create a private-network-only cloud server by not adding any Primary IPs at all. You can change the selected network option at any time. Networks Let your servers communicate through a private network and setup complex network topologies. Ideal for running a Kubernetes cluster or a database server that should not be reachable publicly. Firewalls Our stateful Firewalls make it easy to secure your infrastructure at no additional cost. Define inbound and outbound rules to deny any unwanted traffic. Once configured, you can assign them to as many of your cloud servers as you like.

Servers have both a monthly price cap and a price per hour. Your server's bill will never exceed its monthly price cap. If you delete your Cloud Server before the end of the billing month, you will only be billed the hourly rate. We will bill you for each cloud server until you choose to delete them. Even if you aren't actively using your server, we will bill you for it. Do you bill servers that are off? Yes. All servers that have finished their creation process will be billed until they are deleted, regardless of their state. This is because, internally, we allocate full resources to servers regardless of their power state. And it enables rapid startup and boot times for you, the customer. Is there any way to get a custom configuration? Customized virtual servers (additional RAM, additional/larger drives etc.) are not currently available. How reliable are local storage disks for servers? Servers with local storage keep all data on a local RAID10 on the host system. This provides fault-tolerance in case of hardware defects. They are optimized for high I/O performance and low latency and are especially suited for applications which require fast access to disks with low latency, such as databases. Can I install Windows? Right now we are focusing on support for Linux as an operating system. If you wish, you may install Windows on your own, and we have seen successful installations done. However, we will not provide any support for Windows. Do you plan to add x feature?/Will you add more features? We want to keep adding new features and services and are always interested in hearing from you on how we can improve our product! There are several ways you can provide us with product feedback or feature requests: Via our forum: please post your request in the Hetzner Cloud Board Via email: send us your ideas to cloud-feedback@hetzner.com . Unfortunately, we cannot give you a detailed roadmap of what we are working on. However, you can keep up to date by following us on our social media channels. Will you add additional locations in different geographic regions? We have continuously expanded our cloud locations in recent years. In addition to Germany and Finland, we now also have international locations in Ashburn, Virginia; Hillsboro, Oregon (USA) and Singapore. We are constantly examining possible future locations. If you don’t want to miss the opening of a new location, subscribe to our newsletter or follow us on our social media channels. Is there a library to access Hetzner Cloud from my programming language? We currently maintain official open source libraries for Go and Python . You can find libraries for other languages created by the community in our Awesome Hetzner Cloud List . You are also welcome to develop something yourself! Take a look at our API documentation at docs.hetzner.cloud . What are the Hetzner Cloud Volumes? It is a feature for fast, flexible, and cost-effective (SSD based) block storage which you can attach to your Hetzner Cloud Server. How does Hetzner Online store the data in Volumes? Every block of data is stored on three different physical servers (triple replication). How many servers can I create? Each customer has a default limit for the number of Cloud resources that we simultaneously provide. If you would like to increase your limit, you can send a request to our support team by opening a support ticket via Hetzner Console. Our team will quickly review your request and, if everything is in order, they will increase your limit.
