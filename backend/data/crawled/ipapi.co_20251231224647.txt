An IP Lookup is defined as finding the geographical location (or related information like currency, timezone etc.) of an IP address. The lookup can be done either with our API or website. For example, with a plan of 60,000 IP Lookups / month, you can find the location of 60,000 IP addresses in a month. Each conversion of IP address to location is counted as a lookup (repeat queries of the same IP address counts as a separate lookup). What types of IP address location plans do you offer ? We offer subscription plans with monthly & annual billing options. You can choose a plan based on your expected 
              monthly IP address lookup requirement. This IP lookup limit can be changed by upgrading or downgrading your plan. 
              You'll receive an API key along with usage instructions when you sign-up for a paid plan. Can I change my plan any time ? You can change your plan anytime from the account dashboard or 
              by sending us a message . 
              Plan upgrades are applied instantly. Downgrades take effect from the start of a new billing cycle. How do you authenticate requests from a paid plan ? You will receive an API authentication token and usage instructions on sign-up. The token should be included as a query string 
              in your API requests. It shouldn't take more than a minute to implement this tiny change when you switch from a free plan to 
              a paid plan. If you have any concerns or need assistance with the setup, please feel free to contact us. How do I cancel my subscription ? We have a hassle free, no questions asked cancellation policy. You can cancel your subscription anytime from the account dashboard or by sending us a message or e-mail (you'll receive the details on sign-up).
              Once your plan is cancelled, you won't be billed anymore but your plan will continue to work till the end of your billing cycle. Do you offer a trial plan ? We offer a free IP location plan for trial & evaluation of our service. No credit card 
              is required to use it. Basic fields are accessible without sign-up. If you require full access or a higher limit trial plan, 
              please contact us . We would be happy to help you out. Are there any limits on using the free IP location API ? Under the free tier, you get up-to 1000 IP lookups in a day (approximately 30K/month).
              The plan is suitable for testing & development purposes. It is not meant for use in production or
              deployments. The 
              system may use heuristics to further restrict free tier API calls under certain conditions.
              If you are unable to access the free plan, please contact us . 
              We would be happy to help you out. Is my payment information secure ? We use a secure, PCI compliant payment provider to handle credit & debit card transactions. 
              We never view or store any customer’s full credit or debit card details on our platform. 
              Our primary payment processor is Stripe. It has been audited by an independent PCI QSA and 
              is certified as a PCI Level 1 Service Provider. This is the most stringent level of 
              certification available in the payments industry. What can I do with the API and what are the terms of service ? The API is suitable for a website, mobile or desktop app to automatically
              find the location of an IP address. If you need to perform bulk lookup, we offer
              a separate GUI tool covered under the same subscription plan. If you expect an uncommon usage
              or traffic pattern, please contact us to ensure that the API will be suitable for you.
