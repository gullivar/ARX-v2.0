Contact us How secure is the Ideals data room compared to traditional file-sharing platforms? Unlike email or generic file-sharing tools, Ideals VDR uses enterprise-grade encryption, multi-factor authentication and granular access controls. This keeps your data room online and protected at every stage of the deal Do you provide detailed audit trails for compliance and legal purposes? Yes. Our online data room generates comprehensive audit logs that capture every action – right down to views, downloads and permission changes – keeping you safe and compliant. What types of encryption does Ideals use to protect sensitive documents? The Ideals VDR uses AES-256 encryption, a gold standard in data security. That means even in the unlikely event that files are intercepted, they can’t be read without the decryption key. What measures are in place to prevent unauthorized data leaks during due diligence? Features like dynamic watermarking, fence view and IP restrictions prevent leaks, while activity dashboards and customizable alerts instantly inform you of unusual behavior in your data room. What happens to our data if we terminate the contract? Can we control deletion and archiving? Yes – you control when your data is deleted from the virtual data room. You can also create a USB archive or download an offline backup to keep your project documents safe. Ready to accelerate your deal success?
