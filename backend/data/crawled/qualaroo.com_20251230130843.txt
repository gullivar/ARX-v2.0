Ask the Right Question at the Right Time
Target specific users for actionable feedback

Qualaroo responses are 10x more valuable than email surveys because they catch your visitor in real-time, with context. When you ask questions right on your site or app, the responses are of higher value. You can determine exactly when and who the survey targets. Target your customers based on specific actions, behavioral patterns, events, locations, browser cookies, or data streamed from your applications.

Examples:

Ask pricing feedback when someone is looking at the pricing page
Ask why someone is not buying when they are about to leave
Ask for website/product/app feedback based on engagement
Ask for content feedback when they scroll & read the page
 
10x More Valuable Than Email Surveys
Survey your visitors on-site & get actionable insights

Qualaroo makes it easy to survey specific users in context while they are looking at your product, service & brand. Get actionable user insights based on where visitors are on your site, who they are, how much they pay, visit history and more. Select from professionally designed questions and templates or create your own. Customize Nudges™ with your company colors and branding for a native feel.

Every point of individual feedback enables us to take action.
Having ongoing consumer input and feedback is paramount. Today I might ask them for feedback on the new site experience, tomorrow I want to talk about what the customer is searching for and days later I can ask how their ordering experience was. That variety and the quick pulses help us enormously.
Ajantha Suriyanarayanan,

Director of Consumer Insights for Art.com

    
Using Qualaroo we got to hear feedback from our visitors in their voice.
We used the data to develop and completely redesign our branded landing page and validate our hypotheses. Qualaroo gave us a 16% lift in conversion at 98% statistical significance.
Jaxon Lam,

Senior Strategist at Web Growth, Hootsuite Media Inc.

Customer discovery efforts are critical. How do you best put yourself in the customer’s shoes, and do so in a way that is efficient and easy to do at all stages of product development?
Laura Schaffer

Product Manager for Twilio’s Experimentation Platform
