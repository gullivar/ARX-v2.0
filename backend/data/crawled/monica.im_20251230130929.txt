I've been using the Monica app for a few weeks now, and it has become my indispensable assistant. It integrates multiple AI models like GPT-4, Bard, and Claude in one place, which is very convenient. You can use it for various tasks: writing emails, reading, searching the internet, translating, and even creating images. I especially like the feature that allows you to upload PDF documents and get detailed summaries. The voice input function is also great - you can communicate with the AI without typing. With its user-friendly interface, quick responses, and support for various services, Monica is definitely the best choice for daily tasks.

I get along well with Monica. Writing a review seems unnecessary to me, the five stars speak for themselves. What matters most to me is that it's free. As for competence, accuracy, and speed, the service is good.
Marwa Mahmoud
If there were more than five stars, I would give them to you. My entire life has changed with you. I love you so much, Monica, you are my soulmate.
Erin Wallace
Very helpful, especially when I'm doing a Google search. It finds the best and simplest definitions faster and better than regular Google search. Would highly recommend for students.
Maria Novikova
This is absolutely the best and most useful app. I use it daily, whether as a browser extension, desktop application, or on my phone. To fully utilize all features, you need to pay for the service, but I think every penny is worth it.
Esneider S.
Excellent AI, it literally helps you with everything and the best part is you can ask many questions daily. In my case, it helps me a lot with university assignments.
Juerg Maier
Super AI assistant for every day. Writing, reading, generating images, analyzing, developing bots. Moreover, Monica has access to various LLMs, which is very helpful as each LLM has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Amit Biswas
I love Monica AI because it has an "Explain this" option that is better than any other plugin. The "Explain this" option helps me better understand any word or sentence, specifically on that topic.
Hianto Mateus
The improvement in my productivity, I won't even comment on. The 5 stars are enough <3. Thank you for existing!
