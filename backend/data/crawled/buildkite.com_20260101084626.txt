Deliver software at any scale with the world’s fastest CI platform | Buildkite Your tools should earn your trust, not ask for it. Buildkite is for teams who want to understand their CI and rely on it at any scale. Clarity and precise insight matter more than hidden automation. We focus on giving you dependable signals built on a foundation you can trust. We are a configurable orchestration engine that matches the way your architecture works and the way your team approaches development. Tailor your workflows to reduce build times significantly and tame your code as complexity grows. It’s CI designed to stay reliable, even when your codebase doesn’t. Where other CI tools force trade-offs, we have taken the opposite approach. No convenience over control, no simplicity over reliability, no abstraction over understanding. We give you clarity and autonomy without sacrificing your setup. That’s why teams come to us when shortcuts stop working, ceilings are hit and reliability becomes non-negotiable. Over 1,000,000,000 daily users engage with software pushed through Buildkite. If you’re here, you’re ready for CI you can depend on. We built Buildkite to get you there. ╭ Explore by typing commands ─────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ – See all the main options: help │ │ – Discover how Buildkite is built different: capabilities │ │ – Learn how others are using Buildkite: proof │ │ – See how many dollarydoos Buildkite could cost: pricing │ │ – Exit this CLI and head to our classic site with [E] │ ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ Type help for options [ D ] Docs [ C ] Contact [ S ] Signup [ L ] Login [ E ] Exit to classic Buildkite ~/buildkite 0.080 s __PAGE_CONTENT__ ~/buildkite $ Tap for commands... ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ ⣿ Loading... ∙ 2,364,946 2.4m builds (24h) ∙ View more 155,543,338,565 155.5b builds (since '13) ∙ 3,316,927 3.3m active pipelines
