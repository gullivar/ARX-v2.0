In my mind, that's more important to create successful content. " KI Kevin Indig Director of SEO at Shopify " Before Frase, we could maybe do one post a week. Now we can confidently do three to four a week for each client—and know it's competitive. " R1 Red 11 Media Agency " We're seeing more page views, longer engagement times per top-level service pages, and a much higher number of digital conversions. " JD John Demetrius Content Lead at PTSMC " Frase has become our secret weapon. We're producing content that not only ranks but genuinely impresses our clients. " SS Sarah Salthouse Lead Content Specialist at V Digital Services " It used to take forever to put together an outline. Now, it takes half the time—or less. That was the 'wow moment' for us. It's what converted us. " OS Opinion Stage Content Team " Frase is an exceptional platform that has revolutionized how I approach my business's content optimization and customer engagement. " TR Tony R. Verified G2 Reviewer " I've spent a great deal of time comparing tools to get the most out of what I write, and Frase feels like you're using content marketing cheat codes. " BH Brendan Hufford Content Marketer at ActiveCampaign " Frase has an amazing, and affordable service. We've seen solid gains across the board using Frase, and our team loves working with it! " SG Scott Goldman Head of Content at ServiceTitan Frequently Asked Questions Everything you need to know about SEO and AI search optimization What makes Frase different from other SEO tools? Frase is the only platform that optimizes content for both traditional search engines (Google, Bing) AND AI search platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini). While most SEO tools focus solely on Google rankings, Frase helps you get cited by AI platforms—the fastest-growing source of content discovery with 800% year-over-year growth. Our dual optimization approach means you're not choosing between SEO and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)—you get both. Track when ChatGPT or Perplexity cites your content, optimize for AI answer formats, and maintain your Google rankings all in one platform. Can I really optimize content to get cited by ChatGPT and AI search? Yes. AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude prioritize content with specific characteristics: comprehensive answers (2000+ words), clear explanations with definitions and examples, data-driven content with statistics and research, and visible structure (headers, bullets, Q&A sections). Frase analyzes your content and provides real-time suggestions to match these AI preferences. Our GEO optimization engine helps you create the comprehensive, well-explained content that AI platforms actually read and cite—optimizing paragraph length, adding educational depth, and structuring information the way AI systems prefer to extract it. Most users see their first AI citations within 2-4 weeks of optimizing with Frase. How quickly can I see results? Most Frase users see AI citations within 2-4 weeks of optimizing content, and traditional SEO ranking improvements within 30-60 days. Our Content Opportunities feature delivers the fastest results—it proactively identifies underperforming pages you already have, giving you actionable "Fix/Boost/Fill" suggestions you can implement immediately. For new content, Frase's AI writer generates SEO + GEO optimized articles in minutes, not hours. Many users publish their first optimized article within their first day and start tracking performance immediately. Do I need technical SEO knowledge or coding skills to use Frase? No technical knowledge required. Frase is designed specifically for content teams, marketers, and writers—not developers. Our AI-powered tools guide you step-by-step with clear, actionable suggestions. Write content in our editor and get real-time feedback on SEO score, readability, and AI optimization. The technical aspects (schema markup, meta tags, AI-friendly formatting) happen automatically behind the scenes. Our interface is intuitive—if you can use Google Docs, you can use Frase.

Full access to all Frase features: AI content writer & SEO editor, GEO optimization engine, Content Opportunities (Fix/Boost/Fill framework), AI Search Tracking (ChatGPT, Perplexity citations), Brand Voice customization, SERP research & analysis, and unlimited documents & searches.
