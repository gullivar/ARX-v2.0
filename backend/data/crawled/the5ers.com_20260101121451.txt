                                        1 week ago Simply the best Their support team always listens up

Recently i made the second account using my other gmail
According to thier rules i should have only one since i immediately contacted them
Not only they helped me in removing other email also refunded the amount of the account
Dashboard issue solved immediately for which my account was terminated

And many more examples while scaling my account they helped me

I wanted to write review after atleast 2 months so i had great experience with them so far Guru Raj, 
                                        2 weeks ago The best firm The best firm, the company is very transparent and has integrity. The payout very fast, about 3 days. Thank you Suong Phan Thi Thu, 
                                        2 months ago The most trustworthy prop in the industry The most trustworthy prop in the industry, thank you 5ers for all your support and making this trading journey great for all traders Yazan Abumuslem, 
                                        2 months ago A 60K High Stakes Funded Trader with the5ers Excited to announce that I'm now a 60K High Stakes funded trader with the5ers! They are simply the best. Clear and straightforward rules. Great trading conditions. Beginners' friendly. Fast executions & good spread. No dishonesty/cheating. Customer service-top notch & unmatchable. If you are planning to buy a new prop firm challenge, they are highly recommended. The5ers tick all the boxes. Paul O, 
                                        2 months ago Highly customer based To be honest it's my best experience with propfirm. Highly customer based. They are highly available in social networks or by mail in case of troubles. No hidden rules, not so expensive. The possibility to buy a small challenge (5k) with a small amount of money is a game changer for me because you can learn to trade easily and test both emotions and strategies. Gabriel, 
                                        2 months ago Everything is clear Everything is clear. Just read carefully rules and follow them. I have passed 10k challenge account and I got my funded account. I still have not withdraw money I hope I will withdraw soon. Urolov Jamshidbek, 
                                        5 months ago TOP! I've recently received my funded account and everything has been smooth so far. The support team is fast and responsive, always ready to help whenever needed. No issues at all — everything is working perfectly. Great experience up to now! Marco Totaro, 
                                        5 months ago This is the best-funded account I’ve ever had I’ve tried other funded accounts,but I didn’t find the right support and often faced technical difficulties.
The customer service here is fast and friendly,and I worked through several trials to succeed .Resilience is the key. mohsen shahrisvand,
