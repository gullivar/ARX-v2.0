Quora uses the short domain http://qr.ae when generating some external links back to content on Quora. For example, including http://qr.ae/7FQS9 in a twitter update or email links to the Animated GIFs topic.


To get a short http://qr.ae link for content on Quora, select the sharing options icon underneath the content you'd like to share and select 'Copy link'.
