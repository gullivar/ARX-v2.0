Ever tried to load JavaScript from a CDN and realized that it doesn’t work in a browser
				without a bundler? Skypack operates like your favorite CDN but with an important difference: packages are preoptimized for browser use. But Skypack doesn’t stop there: it handles minification, browser polyfilling, gzip/brotli,
				HTTP/3, caching, and more! Skypack is free to use for personal and commercial purposes, forever. The basic CDN is production-ready and is
				backed by Cloudflare, Google Cloud, and AWS. We’re fully committed to building a core piece
				of infrastructure you can rely on. To give us feedback on Skypack, please visit our issue tracker or join our Discord . If you’re
				interested in advanced features such as a custom domain, or you have specific needs, please
				contact us at info@pika.dev .
