“With the Agora App Builder, we transitioned our codebase quickly and were able to manage many customizations easily. It has been an extremely cost-effective solution.”
Michael Glenn Williams
CTO, TotalVU
“Agora’s Adaptive Video Optimization (AVO) drastically improved the real-time video experience in our app. Users get smooth, high-quality video without freezes—even on slow connections and older devices. Since implementing AVO, we’ve seen a 30% increase in session length and engagement."
Ellard Capiral
VP of Engineering, KUMU
“We really wanted to create a unique customer experience, and Agora allowed us to do a lot of customization while other platforms just had one out-of-the-box solution.”
