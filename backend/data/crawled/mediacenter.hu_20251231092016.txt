Phishing e-mail In recent days, unknown individuals have sent phishing emails in the name of our company.

It is important to note that the sender of these phishing emails is not our company’s email address. Please ignore this email! Important!

New Service: Exclusive Domestic Web Traffic We are pleased to announce our new free service, which enables exclusive domestic web traffic for your website. By activating this option, the selected domain (or even an entire hosting account) will be accessible only from within Hungary. The technical operation is simple: we allow web traffic exclusively from IP ranges belonging to Hungarian internet service providers, while all foreign access is automatically blocked. This service fills an important gap in the Hungarian market and is currently available exclusively to Mediacenter.hu clients. Its introduction was driven by strong customer demand: several webshop owners and webmasters reported that, although their sites serve only a domestic audience, they are regularly targeted by flood attacks or automated hacking attempts originating from abroad. If international accessibility is not important for you, this feature allows you to exclude all foreign traffic and focus solely on your local visitors. The service can be requested through our customer support and is activated free of charge . 23 May. 2025. Update of Email Servers We would like to inform our valued customers that during this period, our email servers are undergoing a system conversion. As part of this process, the software versions running on the servers are being replaced with newer versions that comply with current standards and modern security requirements. This conversion does not affect the availability of the service and will not result in any downtime. 13 Mar. 2025.
