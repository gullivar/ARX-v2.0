Right-click a block to see what adjacent block was removed.

Right-click (place) a block in a location to see what block was removed at that location.

Right-click (place) a block in another block to see who placed it. (ex: place dirt in water to see who placed the water)

Right-click on a door,button,lever,chest,etc, to see who last used it.

A Few Reviews

"It's easy to use and lightning fast when it comes to rollbacks."

"I've been running a MC server since before Bukkit, so I've used just about every block logger out there. CoreProtect is the best and the fastest."

"Go with CoreProtect. It's fast, updated frequently, and logs WorldEdit."

"Overall it felt more natural, simpler, and much faster to use CoreProtect than Prism, which just doesn't compare."

"CoreProtect brings complex logging and rollbacks, whilst at the same time keeping a low profile."
