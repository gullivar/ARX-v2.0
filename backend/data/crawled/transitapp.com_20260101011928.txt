It solves traffic. It reduces our carbon footprint. It frees up urban space for life beyond cars. By empowering people to ditch their car, we can help cities swap out gas stations for parks, on-street parking for places to eat, and congested streets for ones filled with buses and bicycles that let you zip across the city.
