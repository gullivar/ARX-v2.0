Inflation is a measure of how prices change over time. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (a part of the U.S. Department of Labor) selects a "basket of goods," which is a collection of many goods and services that are commonly used by consumers. Every month, the prices of these goods are measured and compared to previous prices. Use the inflation calculator form as a starting point for answering questions that you have about the historical inflation rate in the U.S. This calculator allows you to "correct for inflation". You can also learn about inflation for the UK , Canada , Australia , and Europe . Compared to last year's annual rate, the inflation rate in 2026 is now 2.92% 1 . If this number holds, $100 today would be equivalent to $102.92 next year. Go to the current inflation page for a more detailed, month-to-month view of official inflation rates, or test assumptions to predict future inflation .

Inflation by Spending Category Every item in the Consumer Price Index "basket of goods" is categorized into spending categories. There are 8 major categories (food, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education, and other), and over 200 subcategories. In the past year, the biggest mover is Food and beverages , which changed by -100.00%. This is followed by Housing (-100.00%), Apparel (-100.00%), and finally Transportation (-100.00%). Food and beverages has averaged 3.97% inflation since 1967. Housing, Apparel, and Transportation averaged 4.26%, 1.96%, and 3.34% respectively since they were first recorded. In summary: Food and beverages : -100.00% (avg. 3.97% between 1967 and 2025) Housing : -100.00% (avg. 4.26% between 1967 and 2025) Apparel : -100.00% (avg. 1.96% between 1913 and 2025) Transportation : -100.00% (avg. 3.34% between 1935 and 2025) Note that category changes will appear as "-100%" if data for this year has not yet been released. Inflation by City (1990-current) Inflation can vary widely by city, even within the United States. For obvious reasons we do not have inflation data going all the way back to the 1600s for these cities, but this excerpt showing inflation from 1990 to present day will give you an idea of how inflation varies by location. Click through to see more city details or run your own inflation calculation using the form at the top of the page. Here's how purchasing power in some major cities changed between 1990 and 2020: San Diego, California : 3.41% average rate, $100 → $255.60 , cumulative change of 155.60% Seattle, Washington : 3.33% average rate, $100 → $258.44 , cumulative change of 158.44% Denver, Colorado : 2.80% average rate, $100 → $216.67 , cumulative change of 116.67% San Francisco, California : 2.78% average rate, $100 → $221.79 , cumulative change of 121.79% Atlanta, Georgia : 2.63% average rate, $100 → $212.52 , cumulative change of 112.52% Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Florida : 2.60% average rate, $100 → $210.49 , cumulative change of 110.49% Tampa, Florida : 2.52% average rate, $100 → $200.77 , cumulative change of 100.77% Boston, Massachusetts : 2.45% average rate, $100 → $202.00 , cumulative change of 102.00% New York : 2.42% average rate, $100 → $199.92 , cumulative change of 99.92% Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota : 2.37% average rate, $100 → $192.89 , cumulative change of 92.89% Houston, Texas : 2.23% average rate, $100 → $189.62 , cumulative change of 89.62% Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas : 2.22% average rate, $100 → $188.82 , cumulative change of 88.82% Philadelphia, Pennsylvania : 2.19% average rate, $100 → $187.52 , cumulative change of 87.52% Chicago, Illinois : 2.09% average rate, $100 → $182.26 , cumulative change of 82.26% Detroit, Michigan : 2.08% average rate, $100 → $181.85 , cumulative change of 81.85% St Louis, Missouri : 2.04% average rate, $100 → $179.57 , cumulative change of 79.57% San Diego, California experienced the highest average inflation rate of all the cities, 3.41%, in the 29 years between 1990 and 2020.

This the weighted average of many changes in the price of goods and services. Inflation is quantified as a rate because it is a measure of how the CPI changes over time. When you see an inflation rate, the number is based on change in CPI between two points in time. It's important to know which dates are being compared in order to understand the inflation rate. In most cases, inflation rates are 12-month trailing. This means, for example, that the inflation rate released in March 2026 is based on a comparison to the CPI in March 2025. If the inflation rate is annual, then it's based on the year-over-year CPI. Select one of the options below to explore the basket of goods , or view the U.S. CPI over time . Purchasing Power The concept of "purchasing power" is used to compare the value of a dollar between different years. The Consumer Price Index directly measures purchasing power by keeping track of how many dollars it takes to buy common goods and services. For example, if an apple costs $0.50 last year and $1.00 today, we can say that "the purchasing power of a dollar has decreased," because a dollar now buys you 1 apple instead of 2 (you can view actual inflation rates for apples and many other items). Inflation is linked to purchasing power. As inflation takes place, the purchasing power of the dollar decreases . If deflation takes place, the purchasing power of the dollar increases . Inflation rates of specific categories Medical Care · Housing · Rent · Food · More Inflation-adjusted measures S&P 500 price · S&P 500 earnings · Shiller P/E Example: Calculate the Inflation Rate for $100 since 2000 This inflation calculator uses the following inflation rate formula: CPI in 2020 CPI in 2000 × 2000 USD value = 2020 USD value Then plug in historical CPI values . The U.S. CPI was 172.2 in the year 2000 and 257.208 in 2020: 257.208 172.2 × $100 = $149.37 $100 in 2000 has the same "purchasing power" or "buying power" as $149.37 in 2020. To get the total inflation rate for the 20 years between 2000 and 2020, we use the following formula: CPI in 2020 - CPI in 2000 CPI in 2000 × 100 = Cumulative inflation rate (20 years) Plugging in the values to this equation, we get: 257.208 - 172.2 172.2 × 100 = 49.37% Data source & citation Raw data for these calculations comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' Consumer Price Index (CPI), established in 1913. Price index data from 1774 to 1912 is sourced from a historical study conducted by political science professor Robert Sahr at Oregon State University and from the American Antiquarian Society. Price index data from 1634 to 1773 is from the American Antiquarian Society, using British pound equivalents.
