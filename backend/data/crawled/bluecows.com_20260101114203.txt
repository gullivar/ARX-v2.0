      educational institution excel in today's global network. We specialize
      in making existing technical infrastructures more productive or building
      entirely new ones for greater compatibility and potential. Offering a
      full mesh of services from technical consulting to retail sales, we 
      strive to provide the system enhancement or knowledge boost needed to
      keep pace with current and emerging technologies. We are a proud supporter of the Open Source Community and all of
      our own infrastructure is based on the Debian Linux operating system
      with Open Source software on Intel and AMD processors. We support several
      Linux distributions along with Microsoft Windows®, BSD, Solaris,
      OpenSolaris and MacOS on various hardware platforms. We also support
      and engineer Cisco-based networks. We can help you with most of your Open Source technical needs, from
      a simple explanation of a technical term, to the hardware, software,
      support and information necessary to build or rebuild an entire network
      or server farm. Please visit our Contact page to ask
      a question or tell us your current technical needs. In many cases we
      will be able to assist you at absolutely no charge. If a request for
      technical support should go beyond the scope of our free offerings or
      require long-term commitment, a support specialist will help you get
      set up with an affordable Platinum Support plan for your organization.
