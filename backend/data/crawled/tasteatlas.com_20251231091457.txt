Osban
TUNISIA

n/a

RATE IT

Osban is a North African dish most strongly associated with Tunisia, consisting of sheep intestines and stomach stuffed with a mixture of rice, greens, herbs, and spices, then cooked slowly until tender and flavorful. Its roots go back to the culinary practices of the Maghreb, where stuffed meats and sausages have long been prepared using animal casings filled with grains, vegetables, and aromatic spices. In Tunisia, the dish evolved into a highly specific preparation where the filling emphasizes the freshness of herbs such as parsley, mint, and dill, mixed with greens like spinach or chard, combined with rice, onions, garlic, and sometimes chickpeas. This herbal and grain-based filling sets it apart from purely meat-focused sausages found elsewhere, giving it a distinctive balance of textures and flavors. Preparation begins with thorough cleaning of the intestines and stomach, which are then cut into manageable sections. The filling, made from rice, finely chopped greens, onions, parsley, mint, and spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and black pepper, is spooned into the casings and carefully tied. Once stuffed, the osban is simmered gently in a seasoned broth that may also contain chickpeas, lamb cuts, and root vegetables, which later form the base for couscous or stews. When finished, the osban is sliced into rounds, revealing the colorful filling within, and served alongside couscous or directly in the broth. Today osban is eaten across Tunisia and in some neighboring North African countries, most often during major gatherings, holidays, and communal meals that feature lamb or mutton. It is usually served on a large platter with couscous, vegetables, and meat, or sliced and eaten on its own as part of a feast.  

Manzana asada
SPAIN

n/a

RATE IT

Manzana asada is a baked apple dessert originating in Spain, commonly prepared in regions such as Andalusia and Asturias. It has deep roots in home kitchens where apples were baked as a simple sweet during cooler months or when fruit was abundant. Over time, it was adapted by local cooks, who introduced ingredients such as honey, butter, cinnamon, and regional wines or ciders to enhance its flavor. To make manzana asada, whole apples are washed and cored, leaving a cavity for flavorings. Butter, cinnamon, and sugar (or honey) are placed inside the apple hollows, and sometimes raisins or nuts are added. The apples are set in a baking dish, and liquids like cider, wine, or water may be poured into the bottom to help them cook without drying out. The dish is baked until the apples soften and the fillings melt into a sauce. Some versions drizzle honey or sprinkle cinnamon on top after baking to add aroma and sweetness. One feature of manzana asada is its adaptability: the core method stays the same, but local variations in apple varieties, sweeteners, or cooking liquids let each version reflect one's tastes. Manzana asada is served warm or slightly cooled, often as a dessert or afternoon treat. It is commonly paired with a scoop of cream or served alongside custard, and it also matches well with a glass of apple cider, sweet wine, or even a mild dessert liqueur.

Poule au pot
FRANCE

n/a

RATE IT

Poule au pot is a chicken stew from France, prepared by slow-cooking a hen with a medley of vegetables in a flavored broth. The dish became widely known during the reign of Henry IV, who famously declared that he would ensure “a chicken in every pot” for his subjects, embedding the recipe in national culinary memory. In its preparation a large, mature hen is placed in a deep pot and covered with cold water or stock, then simmered gently along with whole onions studded with cloves, leeks, carrots, turnips, garlic, bay leaves and thyme. After the hen becomes tender, the meat is removed and the vegetables are served first with a portion of the broth. The chicken is then carved and returned to the pot or served on its own, accompanied by the vegetables and ladled broth. Some versions include rice, cream-ruffled potatoes or additional vegetables such as parsley root or celery, and the broth may be clarified before serving. The defining characteristic of poule au pot is its unified cooking vessel in which meat and vegetables cook together, creating a broth-laden dish that serves as both soup and main course. It is typically eaten hot, served in two courses (broth with vegetables, then meat with more broth), and pairs well with light red or dry white wines from western France, such as Bordeaux blanc or a light Beaujolais, which complement the gentle, comforting flavors without overwhelming them.

Bürli
SWITZERLAND

n/a

RATE IT

Bürli is a round Swiss bread roll from the German-speaking cantons—especially the east around St. Gallen—made from a very soft dough of white or semi-white flour, water, yeast, salt, and a touch of malt, baked as paired “double” rolls or in fours so the pieces join at the seam and develop a crisp, flour-dusted crust and a large, irregular crumb. Its documented past reaches to the early 1700s: a 1723 Appenzell note already mentions “bürle” served in inns, indicating a small white-flour bread seen as a luxury for tavern service rather than a farmhouse loaf, and mapping of Swiss small breads shows the style tied to traffic-linked, urban, prosperous areas; sources suggest it began in eastern Switzerland and spread west, later appearing in Romandy under local names. Bakers achieve the hallmark texture by using unusually high hydration—nearly as much water as flour—prefermenting the dough overnight, then mixing salt and malt into water, folding in the preferment and flour, letting the very fluid dough rest, and shaping it gently without further kneading so fermentation gases stay trapped; two or four pieces are set together, dusted with flour, and slid without final proof into a very hot oven, which produces the thin, shattery crust and open crumb. Sold in various sizes (roughly 80–180 g / 3-6 oz, depending on the baker), bürli is eaten at any time of day and commonly served with veal bratwurst or cervelat or split and filled with fleischkäse or ham; in Rapperswil’s Fasnacht custom “eis-zwei-geissebei,” loaves are even tossed to children from the town hall windows alongside sausages and sweets, a practice recorded since the 1940s. At the table, it fits breakfast trays and butcher-stall grills alike, pairing well with Swiss cheeses, cold cuts, mustard, and beer, or with soups and salads where its airy crumb and robust crust hold up to dipping. 

Ganses
NICE, FRANCE

n/a

RATE IT

Ganses are small, fried pastries from the county of Nice, deeply rooted in the region’s carnival-time baking. They have been made for centuries in local households where simple ingredients like flour, eggs, butter and citrus zest were transformed into treats for festive gatherings. The dough is prepared by combining flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk, a pinch of salt and a leavening agent, then flavouring with lemon or orange zest. After resting, the dough is rolled thinly, cut into strips or diamonds, often knotted, and deep-fried in olive oil until golden. While still warm, the ganses are generously dusted with powdered sugar. Variations include using wheat flour blends, increasing the aromatics such as orange blossom water, omitting the leavening for a denser texture, or dipping the finished pastry in honey rather than sugar. What distinguishes ganses is their shape, knotting or folding of the dough strips, and the use of olive oil for frying in the Nice version, which gives them a crisp exterior and light interior. Ganses are eaten during the carnival season, at village squares or family gatherings, and are best enjoyed fresh, paired with coffee, tea or hot chocolate, and they accompany dessert wine or sparkling wine as a sweet finish to a meal.

Shàoxīng zuìjī
SHAOXING, CHINA

n/a

RATE IT

Shàoxīng zuìjī is a cold poultry dish from Shaoxing, where Shaoxing wine serves as both a cooking ingredient and a flavoring agent. It consists of chicken that is poached, cooled, and marinated in Shaoxing huangjiu, a fermented rice wine recognized for its deep amber color and mellow aroma. The dish is a hallmark of Jiangnan cuisine, which emphasizes subtle balance and clarity of taste. Early cooks used the abundant local wine not only to season food but also to preserve it, and dishes such as marinated meats and poultry evolved as part of this practice. Preparation begins with a fresh whole chicken or chicken parts, which are poached gently in water with ginger and scallions until fully cooked but still tender. Once cooled, the chicken is cut into serving pieces and placed in a mixture of Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, sugar, and occasionally a small amount of salt or aromatic spices. The wine used for marination is often drawn from the same aged Shaoxing variety favored for cooking, such as Huadiao or Nuerhong. The chicken is left to soak in this mixture for several hours or overnight under refrigeration, allowing the flavor to penetrate evenly while the alcohol lightly firms the texture. The skin becomes glossy and slightly gelatinous, and the meat absorbs the fragrance of the wine without losing its natural sweetness. It is served cold, often as a starter or part of a banquet spread, and is sliced neatly for easy eating. The clarity of flavor depends on the quality of the wine, which acts as both seasoning and preservative. Some versions feature jellied broth from the poaching liquid poured over the chicken before chilling, creating a firm, translucent coating when cold. Shàoxīng zuìjī is commonly eaten in Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangsu, particularly during summer when cold dishes are preferred. It pairs naturally with the same Shaoxing wine used in its preparation, as the shared aroma enhances both food and drink. Light teas such as Longjing or jasmine are also served alongside to cleanse the palate. The dish remains a prominent example of how Shaoxing wine influences the broader Jiangnan table, defining a regional style centered on balance, restraint, and precision of flavor.  

Chóngqìng kǎoyú
CHONGQING, CHINA

n/a

RATE IT

Chóngqìng kǎoyú is a spicy grilled fish dish from Chongqing, known for combining smoky grilling with the complex layers of Sichuan-style seasonings. It begins with whole freshwater fish, usually carp, catfish, or grass carp, which are cleaned, marinated, and grilled until the skin is crisp and the flesh tender. The grilled fish is then submerged in a bubbling broth of chilies, Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, ginger, and fermented bean paste, served still sizzling in a deep tray or pot. This method creates a dish that is both smoky from the grill and intensely flavored from the sauce, capturing the essence of Chongqing’s bold cooking style. The dish became popular in Chongqing in the late twentieth century when street vendors and small restaurants began offering grilled fish as a specialty. While grilling was not new, the combination of grilling first and then cooking the fish in a seasoned broth set it apart from other methods. This approach allowed the fish to retain the charred aroma while soaking up the richness of Sichuan spices, something that appealed to locals who favored fiery and complex flavors. From its origins in casual eateries, it quickly spread to become a highlight in hotpot-style restaurants across Chongqing and later in other Chinese cities. Today, Chóngqìng kǎoyú is widely eaten in Chongqing restaurants that specialize in spicy cuisine, often shared by groups at dinner. It has spread throughout China and is now found in many cities where Sichuan food is popular, as well as abroad in restaurants catering to fans of regional Chinese cooking. It pairs especially well with plain steamed rice, which balances the intensity of the broth, and with light cold dishes such as cucumber salad or pickled vegetables that refresh the palate. Beer is also a common companion, offering a cooling contrast to the heat.  

Moqueca de camarão
BRAZIL

n/a

RATE IT

Moqueca de camarão is a Brazilian seafood stew made with shrimp, coconut milk, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and fresh herbs, slowly cooked to create a rich, aromatic dish that reflects the flavors of the country’s northeastern and southeastern coasts. It is most closely associated with the states of Bahia and Espírito Santo, where coastal fishing communities developed seafood stews centuries ago to make use of fresh local catches, combining ingredients brought by Portuguese colonizers with African and Indigenous culinary influences. Over time, moqueca evolved into a cornerstone of regional cooking, with shrimp becoming one of its most popular versions due to its abundance along Brazil’s Atlantic coast. The preparation begins by marinating the shrimp with lime juice, garlic, and salt, a step that enhances the seafood’s natural flavor and tenderizes it. A base is built in a clay pot with sautéed onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers, to which coconut milk and dendê oil (palm oil) are added, lending the stew its characteristic creamy texture and deep golden color. The shrimp are gently cooked in the sauce until just tender, often seaoned with parsley or cilantro and sometimes chili for heat, resulting in a dish that is both delicate and deeply flavorful. One of the most distinctive aspects of moqueca de camarão is the use of dendê oil, introduced from West Africa, which not only defines its taste but also symbolizes the cultural fusion at the heart of Brazilian cuisine. The dish is typically served hot, often straight from the pot, accompanied by white rice and farofa, a toasted cassava flour mixture that adds texture and soaks up the sauce. It is a staple of festive gatherings, family meals, and seaside restaurants, where it pairs beautifully with a cold beer or a crisp white wine, enhancing the vibrant, coastal flavors that define it.

Lóngjǐng xiārén
HANGZHOU, CHINA

n/a

RATE IT

Lóngjǐng xiārén is a Hangzhou dish made with freshwater prawns stir-fried with Longjing tea, a green tea produced in the mountains around West Lake in Zhejiang Province. It is considered one of the regional dishes that highlight locally sourced ingredients, since both the tea and the prawns come from the same area and benefit from the soft water and mild climate of Hangzhou. The dish formed in an environment where tea cultivation was closely tied to local agriculture and where small, tender freshwater shrimp were commonly caught in nearby rivers and lakes. Cooks in Hangzhou began combining the two ingredients by infusing the prawns with the aroma of freshly brewed Longjing tea, using the tea both as a flavoring liquid and as an ingredient whose leaves remain visible in the finished dish. Over time, the preparation method became standardized around using very fresh prawns, lightly seasoned and cooked quickly so that the natural sweetness of the shrimp remains the focus. Preparation begins with peeling and deveining small freshwater prawns while keeping the meat intact. The prawns are usually tossed with a little egg white and starch to preserve their delicate texture during stir-frying. Longjing tea is brewed with water just below boiling temperature so the leaves remain green and aromatic, and the brewed tea is set aside for the cooking process. In a hot wok, the prawns are quickly stir-fried with mild seasonings (often only salt, a touch of rice wine, and a small amount of stock), before the strained Longjing tea and a portion of the soft tea leaves are added. The prawns are cooked only briefly, turning white and firm while absorbing the tea’s aroma. The finished dish is pale, lightly glossy, and studded with green tea leaves that contribute both color and a gentle vegetal note. A defining feature is the requirement for high-quality Longjing tea; inferior tea produces a dull color and lacks the characteristic aroma that distinguishes the dish. Lóngjǐng xiārén is served in Hangzhou restaurants, tea-focused establishments, and banquet settings, especially during spring when the first flush of Longjing tea becomes available. It is usually eaten with plain rice and mild vegetable dishes so the prawns and tea flavors remain prominent. The dish pairs well with Longjing tea itself, allowing the beverage to echo the flavors in the food, and also complements light broths, steamed freshwater fish, or neutral white wines that do not interfere with the dish’s subtle aroma.  

Chamoyada
MEXICO

n/a

RATE IT

Chamoyada is a sweet, sour, spicy, and salty frozen treat that originates in Mexico and is especially popular in the central and western regions of the country. It is a type of icy beverage or dessert that blends fruit sorbet, shaved ice, or slush with chamoy, a tangy sauce made from pickled fruit, chili, salt, and lime. The result is a layered and vibrant concoction that captures the bold flavors of Mexican street food culture, often served in cups or tall glasses with a straw and spoon. Its roots trace back to the rise of chamoy itself, which was introduced to Mexico in the mid-20th century and adapted from Asian pickling and seasoning techniques brought by Japanese immigrants. Over time, chamoy became a staple condiment for snacks like fruit, chips, and candy, and eventually found its way into frozen drinks. The idea of combining the sauce with ice and fruit likely grew from local paleterías and street vendors, who experimented with different ways to highlight chamoy’s intense flavors during hot weather. Preparing a chamoyada involves assembling layers of shaved ice or fruit-flavored slush, usually mango, tamarind, or pineapple, and drizzling each layer with generous amounts of chamoy and chili powder. Diced fresh fruit, particularly mango, is often mixed in, and the drink is finished with a tamarind candy straw or a topping of pickled fruit. The balance of heat, acidity, and sweetness is essential, and every component is meant to contrast and complement the others. Variations are common, with some versions including a splash of lime juice, chunks of spicy dried fruit, or even a scoop of sorbet to intensify the fruity base. It is widely enjoyed throughout Mexico as a street food staple, particularly in summer, and has spread to Mexican communities abroad, especially in the United States. It is most often eaten as a standalone refreshment, though it can also accompany savory snacks or spicy antojitos, offering a cooling counterpoint to rich, hearty foods.

Piàn'ér chuān is a noodle dish from Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, known for its use of thin wheat noodles served in a clear broth with sliced bamboo shoots, xuecai snow vegetable, and lean pork. Its development is linked to Hangzhou teahouse and street-side cooking during the early twentieth century, when cooks combined locally available preserved greens and seasonal bamboo shoots with hand-pulled noodles to create a quick, inexpensive meal that reflected the region’s access to both fresh produce and preserved vegetables. Preparation begins with a light broth, often made from pork bones or chicken, simmered until clear. The pork is cut into small pieces and briefly stir-fried, the bamboo shoots are sliced into thin strips, and the xuecai is rinsed to balance its saltiness before being added. Fresh wheat noodles are cooked separately and placed in a bowl, then topped with the toppings and finished with the hot broth. It is eaten throughout the city in small eateries, home kitchens, and teahouses, commonly as a breakfast or light lunch. The dish pairs well with mild side dishes such as cold tofu, simple vegetable plates, or lightly brewed green teas like Longjing, whose clean profile aligns with the broth’s delicacy.

Zhaya
KAZAKHSTAN

3.4

RATE IT

Zhaya is a preserved horse meat product made from a specific cut taken from the upper hind leg of the horse and prepared in Kazakhstan, where it is recognized as a valued meat item associated with guest meals and ceremonial tables rather than everyday cooking. Its development is rooted in steppe pastoral life, where horses held central economic and social importance and slaughtering one required careful use of every part, leading to preservation methods that emphasized whole-muscle cuts instead of minced meat and allowed meat to be stored and transported over long distances without spoilage. Preparation begins with separating the lean muscle from the hind leg, salting it thoroughly, and air-drying it under controlled conditions, sometimes followed by light smoking depending on regional practice, after which the meat may be boiled before serving or sliced thin and served as-is, with minimal seasoning to preserve the character of the cut. Serving usually involves slicing zhaya across the grain and arranging it on a platter either on its own or alongside other horse meat products, and it is often incorporated into large shared meals rather than presented as a standalone portion. What distinguishes zhaya is its use of a single intact muscle rather than fat-layered or stuffed preparation, resulting in a dense, lean texture and a clean meat profile that contrasts with richer horse sausages such as qazı. It is eaten during family gatherings, weddings, commemorative meals, and honored guest occasions, commonly shared communally, and it pairs naturally with flat dough dishes, noodles, or simple breads, as well as softened onions and clear broths, while beverages such as black tea, lightly salted broth, or fermented mare’s milk are consumed alongside to complement its firmness without adding sweetness or acidity.

Gourmetten

RATE IT

Gourmetten is a Dutch tabletop cooking practice centered on small electric grills where individuals prepare their own portions of meat, fish, vegetables, and sauces, and it is most closely associated with the Netherlands, where specialized gourmet sets are widely sold and used in private homes. Its development is linked to mid-twentieth-century shifts in domestic cooking equipment, when compact electric appliances became affordable and Dutch households adopted communal table grilling influenced in part by raclette and other European forms of shared hotplate dining, eventually evolving into a distinct Dutch custom with sets designed specifically for small pans and mini portions. Preparation involves assembling a variety of thinly sliced ingredients, marinated meats, seafood, cut vegetables, ready-made sauces, and small batter mixes for pancakes or eggs, all placed on the table so that each person can cook in their own pan or directly on the grill surface, and serving is continuous and informal, with diners preparing and eating in cycles throughout the meal. The format allows considerable variation in ingredients and encourages extended cooking sessions, and Dutch manufacturers have long produced compact appliances with multiple individual pans, which gives the practice a recognizable setup. Gourmetten is most commonly eaten during Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and family gatherings, where it serves as a social meal that keeps everyone at the table for several hours, and it pairs well with light beers, sparkling wine, crisp white wines such as Pinot Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc, and simple salads or bread that balance the richness of the grilled items.

Máo Shì hóngshāoròu
HUNAN, CHINA

n/a

RATE IT

Máo Shì hóngshāoròu is a well-known Hunanese pork dish, consisting of braised pork belly cooked slowly with soy sauce, sugar, rice wine, and aromatics until it becomes tender, glossy, and deeply flavorful. It is a specific variation of the broader Chinese red-braised pork style, distinguished by its regional flavor profile and its association with Mao Zedong, who was known to favor this preparation. It became widely recognized during the mid-20th century when chefs in Mao’s hometown of Shaoshan refined the dish to his tastes, balancing savory depth with gentle sweetness and a hint of spice. Over time, this particular version gained cultural significance, appearing on restaurant menus and family tables across the region as a tribute to both its flavor and its historical connection. Preparation of Máo Shì hóngshāoròu begins with high-quality pork belly, cut into generous cubes to preserve the layers of meat, fat, and skin that give the dish its characteristic texture. The pork is briefly blanched to remove impurities, then caramelized with sugar to develop a deep amber color and a base layer of sweetness. Shaoxing wine or huangjiu is added along with light and dark soy sauces, sliced ginger, and star anise, and the mixture is simmered gently for one to two hours. Unlike some eastern Chinese versions, this Hunanese style often incorporates a small amount of dried chili or fermented bean paste to introduce subtle heat and complexity. The pork is cooked until the fat becomes silky, the meat tender but still cohesive, and the sauce reduced to a thick, glossy coating that clings to each piece. It is slightly less sweet than its Jiangsu or Zhejiang counterparts and more aromatic, with a savory backbone and a mild, lingering heat that reflects the preferences of Hunan cuisine. The dish is typically served hot as a centerpiece of a family-style meal, often accompanied by plain steamed rice, which absorbs the rich sauce, and lighter vegetable dishes such as stir-fried greens or pickled mustard stems to provide contrast. It is a popular choice at banquets, festive occasions, and everyday meals alike, and many restaurants in Hunan specialize in their own versions.  

Gānguō jī
SICHUAN, CHINA

n/a

RATE IT

Gānguō jī is a dry pot chicken dish from Sichuan province. The name literally means “dry pot chicken,” referring to a cooking method that differs from saucy braises or soups by using high heat and minimal liquid to intensify the flavor of each ingredient. The origins of gānguō cooking are closely linked to Sichuan’s hot pot culture. As dry pot techniques evolved from the communal hot pot tradition, cooks sought ways to achieve the same intensity of flavor without the broth, creating dishes that were richer, more aromatic, and easier to serve individually. Gānguō jī grew from this evolution, often appearing in small eateries and home kitchens as a more concentrated version of the flavors diners loved in hot pot: spicy, numbing, and deeply savory. Over time, it became a symbol of contemporary Sichuan cooking: a style that celebrates both the power of spice and the balance of heat, fragrance, and texture. Preparation begins with marinating chicken pieces, usually bone-in chunks, in soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, ginger, and a little starch to enhance their tenderness. The chicken is first seared or lightly fried to develop a golden crust, which locks in moisture and creates a base layer of flavor. It is then cooked together with dried chilies, Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, ginger, and doubanjiang, creating a deeply aromatic foundation. Various vegetables such as lotus root, potatoes, celery, or mushrooms are often added, not only for texture but also to absorb the spicy, savory oil released during cooking. The process uses very little liquid, relying instead on rendered chicken fat and infused chili oil to carry the flavors, resulting in a dish that is rich without being heavy. Gānguō jī is typically served as a main dish, often shared family-style at the center of the table. Its intense flavors make it ideal alongside plain steamed rice, which balances the heat and richness, and it is commonly paired with cold vegetable salads or lightly pickled side dishes to refresh the palate. In restaurants, it may be accompanied by a mild soup or tea to round out the meal.  

Choux au craquelin
FRANCE

n/a

RATE IT

Choux au craquelin is a French pastry consisting of cream-filled choux buns topped with a thin layer of crisp dough that gives them a delicate, crackled surface. It evolved from classic choux pastry techniques refined in French pâtisseries, where chefs sought to improve both texture and appearance. The addition of the craquelin — a sweet, buttery topping that bakes into a thin crust — provided a more uniform rise and an appealing crunch, quickly establishing the pastry as a hallmark of modern French baking. The preparation begins with the craquelin topping, made by mixing softened butter, brown sugar, and flour into a smooth dough. This mixture is rolled out thinly, then cut into small discs that will later cover each choux mound. The choux pastry itself is prepared by heating water, butter, sugar, and a pinch of salt until boiling, then stirring in flour to form a smooth paste. The dough is allowed to cool slightly before eggs are added one by one until the texture becomes glossy and thick enough to pipe. Small mounds of this dough are piped onto a baking tray, and a craquelin disc is placed on each mound. As the choux bakes, steam causes it to expand evenly under the craquelin, which forms a delicate, crackled crust as it hardens in the oven. Once baked and cooled, the choux are filled through a small opening with a cream such as vanilla pastry cream, chantilly, chocolate, or praline. The contrast between the crisp shell and smooth filling defines the pastry’s appeal. Variations include flavouring the craquelin with cocoa, matcha, or coloured sugar to create visual patterns, or filling the choux with fruit-flavoured creams, coffee, caramel, or hazelnut praline. Some versions use mousseline cream, combining pastry cream and butter for a richer texture, while others opt for lighter fillings such as whipped ganache or custard infused with herbs or spices. The choux can also be stacked into small towers or presented as individual pastries topped with icing or powdered sugar. A distinctive feature of choux au craquelin is the way the craquelin layer helps the choux puff up evenly, producing a perfectly rounded shape and a crisp, golden surface that resists softening. Choux au craquelin is eaten as a dessert or pâtisserie item and is found in bakeries and pastry shops throughout France and beyond. It is often served at celebrations, at afternoon teas, and as part of fine-dining desserts. It pairs well with coffee, tea, or sweet wines, and its light texture makes it suitable after a meal. The combination of precise technique, balance of textures, and elegant presentation has made choux au craquelin a benchmark of skill in French pastry-making.

Pâte d’olive
FRANCE

RATE IT

Pâte d’olive is an olive paste from France made by grinding cured olives with olive oil into a smooth or coarse mixture used as a spread, condiment, or cooking ingredient. It is most closely linked to the Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur region, where olive cultivation is widespread and local mills and households have long processed olives into various forms to extend their use beyond whole-olive consumption. Its development followed the needs of olive-growing communities that aimed to preserve or repurpose fruit that was fully edible but not ideal for table presentation, leading to the steady use of pastes made from brined or salt-cured olives. As olive production expanded in southern France, pâte d’olive became both a home preparation and a product sold by small producers, cooperatives, and regional food companies, with versions based on local olive cultivars such as Cailletier gaining particular presence in markets. Preparation begins with olives that have already undergone curing, most often through brining, though dry-salted olives are also used for stronger flavor. The pits are removed and the flesh is crushed, ground, or blended while olive oil is added gradually until the paste reaches the desired consistency. Some cooks incorporate lemon juice, garlic, herbs, or capers, but the defining feature is that the paste is centered on olives rather than on added ingredients, distinguishing it from tapenade, which requires capers and usually anchovies. Once prepared, the paste is stored in jars and typically covered with a thin layer of olive oil to reduce oxidation and maintain its flavor. Textural differences depend on the olive variety, its ripeness, and the curing method, giving regional producers products with distinct profiles. Pâte d’olive is eaten throughout southern France and appears in export markets that specialize in Provençal foods. It is spread on bread, toasts, or crackers, used in sandwiches, stirred into sauces or vinaigrettes, applied to fish or poultry before baking, and incorporated into pasta or vegetable dishes. It pairs well with fresh goat cheese, tomatoes, roasted peppers, cured meats, anchovies, and rustic breads. Suitable beverage pairings include dry rosé from Provence, light white wines, sparkling water, and herbal teas when served as part of a simple appetizer plate.

RATE IT

Shāchá miàn is a noodle dish especially associated with Xiamen and nearby coastal cities, where it is prepared with wheat noodles served in a broth seasoned with shāchá sauce, a savory paste made from dried seafood, spices, peanuts, and aromatics. It developed in a region with a long history of overseas trade and migration, during which southeast Asian satay sauces influenced local cooking, and Fujian cooks adapted those flavors into a paste suited to their soups and stir-fries. Over time, shāchá sauce became a staple in markets and home kitchens, and noodles cooked with it formed a recognizable regional dish often sold in small eateries and breakfast stalls. Preparation begins with a clear broth, usually made from pork bones, dried shrimp, or a mix of both, which is simmered until lightly flavorful. Shāchá sauce is then added and mixed until it dissolves into the liquid, creating a broth with a slightly opaque, amber appearance. Fresh wheat noodles are blanched separately and placed into a bowl, then topped with sliced pork, thinly cut beef, offal, seafood, or fish balls depending on local preference. The hot shāchá broth is poured over everything, and some cooks finish the bowl with garlic oil, chopped scallions, or fried shallots. Certain vendors offer dry versions by tossing the noodles directly with shāchá sauce and serving the broth on the side. The dish is eaten throughout the day in Xiamen and surrounding areas, commonly for breakfast or as a quick meal at small shops, night markets, and household tables. It pairs well with light teas, soy milk, or simple side dishes such as boiled greens, fried dough sticks, or pickled vegetables that balance the rich, aromatic broth.  

Bōbōjī
CHENGDU, CHINA

RATE IT

Bōbōjī is a cold chicken skewer dish from Chengdu in Sichuan province, known for its fragrant, spicy, and numbing flavor. The name comes from the word “bōbō,” which refers to the earthenware or metal pot used to soak the skewers in seasoned chili oil. It belongs to the family of cold Sichuan foods that rely on aromatic oils, spices, and herbs rather than heat from cooking, capturing the region’s precise balance of chili, peppercorn, and sesame. Bōbōjī has its roots in Chengdu’s street food culture, where cold dishes offered relief from the region’s humid climate. Over time, vendors developed their own versions, influenced by local ingredients and preferences. The dish grew from simple chicken boiled and dipped in chili oil into an elaborate cold skewer experience, served with layers of spice, sesame, and herbs. Chengdu’s long-standing love for málà—the combination of numbing and spicy—shaped its flavor, while the city’s reputation as a hub for refined street food helped spread it beyond local neighborhoods. Today, it is widely recognized across Sichuan and often seen as a link between the more rustic spicy snacks and the intricate cold dishes served in restaurants. Preparation begins with boneless chicken, usually breast or thigh, poached gently with aromatics like ginger, scallion, and cooking wine until tender. Once cooled, it is cut into bite-sized pieces and skewered onto small bamboo sticks. A sauce is prepared from a base of chili oil infused with Sichuan peppercorns, sesame paste, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and sometimes a touch of sugar or crushed peanuts for texture. The skewers are then placed in a large bowl or pot, often the “bōbō” that gives the dish its name, and fully submerged in the seasoned oil mixture. They are left to marinate and absorb the flavors before being served at room temperature or slightly chilled. The resulting taste is complex: aromatic from the spices, mildly numbing from the peppercorns, and balanced by the nutty and tangy sauce. In Chengdu, bōbōjī is eaten throughout the year but is particularly popular in warm weather when cold dishes dominate the table. It is commonly served as a shared snack in casual eateries or night markets, often accompanied by cold noodles, pickled vegetables, or small glasses of beer or herbal tea. The dish also appears in restaurants specializing in cold Sichuan appetizers, where it bridges the gap between street food and refined dining.

Kǒushuǐjī is a cold chicken dish from Sichuan, recognized for its rich and numbing chili sauce that combines heat, fragrance, and spice with a clean finish. The name means “mouth-watering chicken,” a reference to its ability to stimulate appetite through aroma and balance rather than heaviness. The origins of the dish trace back to home kitchens and small eateries in Sichuan, where poached chicken served with chili oil became a favored preparation, especially in the warmer months. Over time, chefs refined the sauce, adjusting its proportions to achieve a harmony that would later make it one of the most recognizable cold appetizers in Chinese cuisine. Its name was popularized during the twentieth century in Chengdu, when versions of the dish began appearing on restaurant menus under that title, emphasizing not just taste but the sensory anticipation that preceded it. Preparation starts with a whole chicken, often poached gently in seasoned water with scallion, ginger, and a pinch of salt until the meat is just cooked through and still moist. After cooling, the chicken is chopped into bite-sized pieces and arranged on a plate, sometimes over a bed of cucumber or bean sprouts for freshness. The defining element is the sauce, made from chili oil infused with crushed Sichuan peppercorn, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, sesame paste, sugar, and a touch of cooking wine. The mixture is poured over the cooled chicken, coating it evenly without soaking it. Roasted sesame seeds, chopped peanuts, and scallions are usually sprinkled on top, completing the contrast of smooth, spicy, and nutty textures. The flavor develops as the oil spreads across the surface of the meat, releasing aroma and gentle heat that lingers but does not overpower. Kǒushuǐjī is eaten throughout China, often as the opening dish of a Sichuan meal, served before hot dishes to awaken the palate. It pairs naturally with plain rice or light noodles, which help absorb the sauce, and with mild drinks such as jasmine tea or cold beer that temper the spice.

Chicken parmigiana is a poultry dish consisting of breadcrumbs-coated chicken breasts that are topped with tomato sauce and cheese, then baked until the cheese melts and the chicken is properly cooked. Although it has an Italian-sounding name, chicken parmigiana is actually an American dish, derived from an Italian dish called melanzana alla parmigiana, or eggplant parmigiana. No one knows who invented chicken parmigiana, but it is very popular in American cities with a large number of Italian immigrants such as New York and New Jersey. Regardless of the origin, the dish is usually served on top of rice or pasta, while some prefer it as a part of submarine sandwiches.

Olivier Salad
MOSCOW, RUSSIA

RATE IT

Olivier salad is a Russian salad with variable ingredients, but it is typically made with chopped vegetables, meat, and mayonnaise. The key ingredients include diced potatoes, vegetables, eggs, chicken, or ham. This salad is one of the most important appetizers at the New Year's salad buffets in Russia, as well as in some of the other countries of the former USSR. The original was invented in the 1860s by Lucien Olivier, a chef in the popular Moscow restaurant called L'Hermitage. Olivier guarded the recipe until he died, but it is believed that the recipe was stolen by an employee who watched the chef at work, so the salad is still made today. Another theory says that the recipe for the new Olivier salad was developed by one of the restaurant's customers who wanted to keep the salad alive after the chef passed away. Olivier salad as we know it today is nothing like the original version, because it was called game bird mayonnaise, made with gourmet ingredients such as black caviar, capers, hen, and crayfish tails. Over time, the salad evolved and most of the gourmet ingredients have been replaced with more common ones such as peas, chicken, ham, and pickles. Today, the variations are endless, but most Russian chefs agree on one thing: adding carrots to the Olivier is a heresy. Interestingly, Olivier salad is also sometimes called Russian salad, while the meatless version is called French salad or francuska salata, probably due to the French name of its creator. The Spanish version is known as ensaladilla rusa. It is so popular in Spain that it's an important part of the Spanish gastronomy as well as being a staple in schools and summer camps all over the country. Ensaladilla rusa is also one of Spain's most popular tapas – in some cases, it's even served free of charge if you order a beer. There's also the Piedmontese insalata russa, typically consumed as an appetizer, and with many variations, so the salad might also include ingredients such as pickled cauliflower, anchovies, and tuna. Interestingly, in the Italian municipality of Carrù, tuna is an obligatory element of the salad.

Bakwan Malang is a savory Indonesian meatball soup that originates from the city of Malang in East Java. It consists of a flavorful broth served with a variety of bakso or meat-based components, such as beef meatballs, tofu stuffed with ground meat, fried wontons, and crispy dumplings, typically accompanied by yellow noodles or vermicelli. The name “bakwan” in this context refers not to vegetable fritters, as it does in some regions, but rather to the ensemble of meatball components, while “Malang” denotes the dish’s geographic origin. The broth is usually made from simmered beef bones and seasoned lightly with garlic and shallots, allowing the richness of the meat and the texture of the accompaniments to stand out. Vendors and street stalls throughout Malang and other parts of Java serve bakwan Malang as a complete, customizable bowl, often allowing customers to choose their preferred items from a display before ladling the hot broth over the selection. Condiments like sweet soy sauce, sambal, fried shallots, and lime are commonly added at the table to adjust flavor and heat to personal taste. While similar to bakso in its core components, bakwan Malang is specifically defined by its East Javanese origin and the variety of toppings that come with it.

Gaz

RATE IT

Gaz is a Persian confection known for its chewy texture and delicate sweetness, primarily produced in the city of Isfahan. It belongs to the broader family of nougat confections and is often considered a symbol of Isfahani hospitality and craftsmanship. Gaz is typically made by combining a syrup derived from the sap of a desert plant called angebīn (Tamarisk manna) or, in more modern recipes, glucose syrup, with egg whites beaten into a stiff foam. The history of gaz dates back several centuries, when the sap collected in the Iranian plateau was blended with local ingredients to create a sweet that could be stored for long periods. This reliance on manna, rather than only sugar, is a defining feature of authentic gaz and contributes to its distinct taste and texture. This base is enriched with pistachios or almonds and flavored with rosewater to create a distinctive aroma. The preparation of gaz involves heating the syrup to a precise temperature and then slowly folding it into the whipped egg whites to create a smooth, elastic mass. This mixture is stirred constantly to prevent sticking and to achieve the desired density and gloss. Once the nuts and flavorings are incorporated, the nougat is spread into molds dusted with flour or starch to prevent sticking and left to cool. When firm, it is cut into small rectangular or diamond-shaped pieces and sometimes wrapped in edible rice paper to keep the surface from becoming tacky. Gaz is traditionally served alongside tea and is popular as a gift during holidays and family gatherings. The flavor combines the floral notes of rosewater with the richness of nuts and the gentle sweetness of the manna syrup, which sets it apart from European nougat varieties. The confection’s pale, ivory color and tender consistency have made it one of Iran’s most recognizable sweets, with shops in Isfahan specializing exclusively in its production. Over time, producers have developed variations, including gaz with saffron or flavored with cardamom, though the classic version remains the most sought-after.

This dish is one of the most traditional Roman dishes, and it is deeply rooted in regional cuisine. The name of this Italian classic comes from salti in bocca, meaning it jumps in the mouth, which is exactly what the flavors of saltimbocca do. The dish consists of tender, pan-fried veal cutlets that are wrapped in Italian prosciutto, flavored with fresh sage, then sautéed in white wine. Even though the original recipe for saltimbocca is supposedly centuries old, the first written trace of this dish was found in Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook La Scienza in Cucina e l’Arte di Mangiar Bene, in which he claims to have enjoyed this famed dish at Roman trattoria Le Venete. However, saltimbocca alla Romana is often said to have originated not in Rome, but in Brescia, a Lombardian city nestled at the foot of the Alps, where an almost identical dish dubbed saltimbocca alla Bresciana has been prepared since the early 1800s. Regardless of its true origins, saltimbocca is one of Rome’s favorite secondi piatti today, and it is usually enjoyed with a side of green vegetables such as piselli alla Romana, Roman-style green peas.

Osban
TUNISIA

Tunisian Cooked Sausage #3. Osban is a North African dish most strongly associated with Tunisia, consisting of sheep intestines and stomach stuffed with a mixture of rice, greens, herbs, and spices, then cooked slowly until tender and flavorful. Its roots go back to the culinary practices of the Maghreb, where stuffed meats and sausages have long been prepared using animal casings filled with grains, vegetables, and aromatic spices. In Tunisia, the dish evolved into a highly specific preparation where the filling emphasizes the freshness of herbs such as parsley, mint, and dill, mixed with greens like spinach or chard, combined with rice, onions, garlic, and sometimes chickpeas. This herbal and grain-based filling sets it apart from purely meat-focused sausages found elsewhere, giving it a distinctive balance of textures and flavors. Preparation begins with thorough cleaning of the intestines and stomach, which are then cut into manageable sections. The filling, made from rice, finely chopped greens, onions, parsley, mint, and spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and black pepper, is spooned into the casings and carefully tied. Once stuffed, the osban is simmered gently in a seasoned broth that may also contain chickpeas, lamb cuts, and root vegetables, which later form the base for couscous or stews. When finished, the osban is sliced into rounds, revealing the colorful filling within, and served alongside couscous or directly in the broth. Today osban is eaten across Tunisia and in some neighboring North African countries, most often during major gatherings, holidays, and communal meals that feature lamb or mutton.

A perfect remedy for a hot summer day called gazpacho is a cold soup consisting of crushed tomatoes, finely chopped cucumbers, onions, peppers, croutons, vinegar, and olive oil. With the same level of familiarity as paella to the consumers worldwide, the soup's refreshing, cool and acidic flavors promote Spanish cuisine at its best. The dish began as a light lunch that the wives brought to their husbands in the field in order to cool them down from the hot summer sun. Shortly after, it began to be served at the end of big meals, although today it is a popular summer appetizer. Throughout Spain, there are a number of gazpacho varieties, such as gazpacho blanco (white gazpacho) or ajo blanco, a Málaga specialty made with garlic, bread, and almonds, with a garnish of green grapes. As the dish evolved, all kinds of ingredients started to be added to the soup, such as watermelon and cantaloupe. Regardless of the varieties, all gazpachos share a common thread of three key ingredients - bread, vinegar, and oil.

The epitome of a cozy Sunday breakfast in Denmark is a crispy sweet treat known as Danish pastry. It is made with laminated dough, where the dough is repeatedly covered with butter and folded over itself. The result is a creation that is quite similar to puff pastry. The dough is shaped into different forms and filled with flavorful, creamy fillings. Traditional fruit fillings such as apple and raspberry, vanilla custard, and almond paste are Danish favorites, but due to its popularity, the fillings are usually region-specific. For example, cinnamon is more favored during the winter season, while readily available fresh fruit is occasionally incorporated into Danish pastry during the warmer months. The pastry is often decorated with almond flakes or lemon drizzle, which contribute to a more sophisticated look and provide more interesting flavors and textures. It is believed that Danish pastry was created by Austrian bakers who were hired in Denmark during the bakers' strike in 1850, and they brought a tradition of preparing laminated dough to the country. They modified the recipe by adding more butter to create what is today known as Danish pastry. However, in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway it is referred to as wienerbrød, originating from the name Viennese bread, and in Vienna, it is often called Kopenhagener plunder. Today, this pastry is an internationally recognized baked product that is found in many European countries and both North and South America. With intricate designs and a variety of flavors, it represents a staple pastry of every bakery and a favorite sweet breakfast of many people.

The ancient Anatolian city of Antep, today known as Gaziantep, is Türkiye's gastronomic capital famous for being home to the world’s finest pistachios and the delicious Antep baklavası. Originally an Ottoman legacy, baklava is regarded as one of the greatest creations from the pastry chefs at Topkapı Sarayı, the major royal residence of Ottoman sultans from the 15th to the 19th century. Baklava was traditionally prepared for Eid-al-Fitr, also known in Türkiye as Ramazan or Şeker Bayramı, a religious holiday when Muslims celebrate the ending of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. Today, this Turkish treat is available year-round, and with more than 500 baklava bakeries in the city of Gaziantep, it is definitely not to be missed, especially during the pistachio harvest from midsummer to September, when these emerald-colored nuts are just the right size for baklava. To make this popular pastry, the finely crushed, genuine Gaziantep pistachios are generously spread between paper-thin sheets of phyllo dough which are brushed with melted butter and smeared with semolina cream. Antep baklava is then splashed with another dose of melted butter, baked, and finally, poured over with a hot sugar and lemon juice syrup. According to Turkish ustaları or master bakers, a well-baked baklava is tender, but at the same time has a perfect crunch to it. When divided with a fork, it makes a cracking sound which is not only a sign of freshness, but also a sign of the finest baklava, which isn't too sweet or heavy and leaves a heavenly taste in your mouth. Garnished with crushed pistachios, and often topped with kaymak, Turkish clotted cream, or a scoop of milk-flavored ice cream called kaymaklı dondurma, Antep baklava goes a long way: it can be enjoyed either with Turkish coffee in the morning or as a mid-afternoon treat with a cup of tea, but also as an after lunch or dinner dessert.

Originally, this treat was made before the 18th century by Catholic monks and nuns in Santa Maria de Belém in Lisbon. The tart was made from leftover egg yolks that were used in the clearing of wines and starching of clothes. Later on, the clerics made a deal with a nearby bakery to start selling pastel de nata commercially, and the product was a huge success. It is still hugely popular, and the fact can be supported by long lines of people who are waiting on their pastel de nata in front of numerous Portuguese bakeries.

Poule au pot
FRANCE

French Chicken Dish #16. Poule au pot is a chicken stew from France, prepared by slow-cooking a hen with a medley of vegetables in a flavored broth. The dish became widely known during the reign of Henry IV, who famously declared that he would ensure “a chicken in every pot” for his subjects, embedding the recipe in national culinary memory. In its preparation a large, mature hen is placed in a deep pot and covered with cold water or stock, then simmered gently along with whole onions studded with cloves, leeks, carrots, turnips, garlic, bay leaves and thyme. After the hen becomes tender, the meat is removed and the vegetables are served first with a portion of the broth. The chicken is then carved and returned to the pot or served on its own, accompanied by the vegetables and ladled broth. Some versions include rice, cream-ruffled potatoes or additional vegetables such as parsley root or celery, and the broth may be clarified before serving. The defining characteristic of poule au pot is its unified cooking vessel in which meat and vegetables cook together, creating a broth-laden dish that serves as both soup and main course. It is typically eaten hot, served in two courses (broth with vegetables, then meat with more broth), and pairs well with light red or dry white wines from western France, such as Bordeaux blanc or a light Beaujolais, which complement the gentle, comforting flavors without overwhelming them.

The cocktail can be made with different types of rum or different proportions of ingredients than those used in the original recipe, but it can also be served frozen. Regarding the cocktail's origins, a bartender named Ramón "Monchito" Marrero Pérez made this cocktail in 1954 at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, which is now considered a birthplace of the Piña Colada.

Delicately flavored soy eggs are a simple and versatile Chinese invention. Boiled and peeled eggs are submerged in the soy sauce mixture and left for a couple of hours until the salty flavors penetrate, infuse, and color the outer layer of the egg. The simplest marinade includes a combination of soy sauce, spices and other ingredients that might include typical and authentic ingredients such as scallions, sliced ginger, chili peppers, or garlic. The marinade can be boiled or simply mixed, and eggs should not be left in it for too long, as the flavors would become overpowering. When cooking soy eggs, the key is not to overcook them. The yolk should be left soft, almost like a silky custard, and slightly runny in the center. Soy sauce eggs are best known as a topping served alongside hearty ramen dishes, but they also represent a quick and satisfying snack and are commonly eaten as an accompaniment to different alcoholic beverages. Since their taste is not overpowering, they make an excellent breakfast choice and a nutritious addition to various salads and rice dishes.

Barbecue Ribs

Originally an American invention, succulent and smoky barbecue ribs have become one of the most famous dishes in the world. The dish is typically prepared with pork ribs, usually spareribs or the tender, leaner baby back ribs. Pork is the obvious choice for the dish since it tends to be juicier on the bone, allowing the meat to come right off after the grilling process. It is one of the barbecued dishes which leans on the American-style grilling, in which the meat is cooked long, slow, and at a low temperature. To give the ribs their distinct taste and texture, they are always treated before grilling. Two most common ways include marinating and dry-rubbing. Marinating is usually done with soy or Worchester sauce, different spices, ketchup, and occasionally even whisky or honey. As the name suggests, dry-rub is usually made with powdered spices such as smoked paprika, garlic, Mediterranean or Oriental spices, sugar, and mustard. During grilling, the ribs are repeatedly smothered with a spicy barbecue sauce, which eventually provides the ribs with a luscious, viscous, and slightly spicy external layer. Ribs are a typical part of classic American barbecues, although they can be found in restaurants around the world and are also commonly prepared at home.

Sashimi

RATE IT

Sashimi is a Japanese delicacy consisting of thinly sliced raw fish or shellfish (or even meat) served with soy sauce and other ingredients such as wasabi or ginger paste. Most common ingredients used in the preparation of sashimi are tuna, squid, scallop, whale, and octopus. Sashimi can be cut in different ways to alter the appearance of the dish, from extremely thin to very thick slices of fish. It is usually served as an appetizer, decorated with shiso leaves, cucumbers, and seaweed (wakame and tosaka-nori). There is a tradition in Japan to serve an odd number of pieces of sashimi on a plate called mukozuke, because it is considered bad luck to have an even number of ingredients. Sashimi is often confused with another popular Japanese dish, sushi, a dish made with raw fish and vinegared rice. Sashimi and sushi also share a common history, as both dishes were originally prepared during the 8th century in Southeast Asia.

Kai yang is a poultry dish made by grilling or barbecuing a whole, marinated chicken. Although the dish has origins with the Lao people of northeastern Thailand, today it is extremely popular and commonly eaten throughout the country. The chicken is typically paired with sticky white rice, dipping sauces (sweet sauce in the Central region, sour sauce in the Northeast), and a vegetable salad called som tam. It can be found at numerous street stalls all over Thailand. Kai yang differentiates itself from other grilled chicken dishes by its marinade, which is made from numerous ingredients such as soy sauce, ginger, white pepper, fish sauce, vinegar, hoisin sauce, and herbs such as cilantro, lemongrass, and garlic. The dish is also characterized by the method of preparation: the chicken is cooked slowly in order for the meat to absorb all of the flavors from the marinade. Although not much is known about the origin of kai yang, it is believed that the dish was reserved only for the wealthy people in the past, since Lao people primarily consumed seafood, and other types of protein were very rare.

Unadon
JAPAN

RATE IT

Unadon is a Japanese dish consisting of grilled unagi (eel) fillets placed on top of steamed rice. The eel is grilled kabayaki-style, where the fish is split, gutted, butterflied, cut into squares, skewered, then diped in tare sauce before being grilled. The tare sauce consists of soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sake. It provides the necessary caramelization to the fish during the grilling process. Before serving, unadon is typically garnished with sanshō berries on top. In Kantō, the eel is traditionally steamed before grilling, resulting in a more tender texture of the fish, while in Kansai, the eel is simply grilled without prior steaming. This way of enjoying eel over rice was invented in the Edo era, and nowadays it is a classic dish in Japanese cuisine.
