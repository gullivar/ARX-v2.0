So we don’t care if you give us a toothpaste tube, a tractor, a space shuttle, a school, or a whole Fortune 500 company. We innovate by applying our process, expertise, and decades of experience to bring completely new ideas to life.” David Kelley, IDEO Founder Jim Hackett "Changing how people think is hard. Changing how an organization fundamentally operates is almost unimaginable. IDEO helped us do both. Their strategic clarity, radical creativity, and deep partnership turned what felt like an impossible task into one of the most successful transformations we’ve ever unlocked."

Their collaboration enabled us to deeply understand the needs of both consumers and internal stakeholders, co-create a strategic framework tailored to those insights, and clearly quantify the expected impact on our business outcomes and organizational capabilities." Global Chief Growth Officer, Mars Petcare Aaron Sefi “Working with IDEO enabled Kooth to supercharge the development of Soluna as a product-led initiative. With their help developing key conceptual themes and dreaming the art of the possible, we were able to design, develop, and launch at an incredible pace. The result—the numbers speak for themselves—but most importantly, youth in California recognize Soluna as a mental health app that speaks to them.” Read more Chief Product & Research Officer, Kooth Sean Duffy “Over a decade later, I still reflect on the ‘North-Stars’ I learned at IDEO, and the power of deeply, reflectively listening to the needs of users and watching their behaviors as the one and only truth. Our IDEO roots helped grow branches that still benefit the business and our members today.” Read more Co-Founder & CEO, Omada Health Ask us for references Frequently asked questions What is human-centered design, and how does IDEO apply it? Human-centered design (HCD) is a creative approach to problem-solving that starts with understanding peoples' needs, motivations, and behaviors, and ends with innovative solutions that are meaningful and effective for them. Rather than beginning with technology or business constraints, human-centered design begins with empathy: observing how people live, work, and make decisions to uncover deep insights that drive new possibilities. At IDEO, human-centered design is not just a process—it’s a mindset and a practice we’ve refined over decades. We apply it through three interconnected phases: ‍ Inspiration : Engaging directly with people to uncover unmet needs and opportunities. Ideation : Generating and testing a wide range of ideas, guided by what we’ve learned from real-world contexts. Implementation : Bringing solutions to life through rapid prototyping, iteration, and collaboration with partners, organizations, and communities. This approach allows IDEO to design new products, services, systems, and strategies that create value for both people and businesses. It’s been used to help organizations reimagine everything from healthcare experiences to workplace cultures to the future of education and sustainability. How does IDEO help organizations innovate? IDEO helps organizations innovate by combining human-centered design, systems thinking, and creative experimentation to unlock new sources of value. We partner with leaders to understand their people, culture, and market context—then co-create strategies, products, and services that make innovation tangible and sustainable. ‍ At the heart of IDEO’s work is the belief that innovation happens where human needs and organizational capabilities meet. We help teams build the capacity to design for that intersection through: ‍ Deep insight and foresight: We uncover unmet needs, emerging behaviors, and cultural signals that point to future opportunities. ‍ Creative experimentation : We use rapid prototyping and iterative testing to turn ideas into evidence, reducing risk while expanding possibilities. ‍ Capability building : We train and coach organizations to embed design thinking, experimentation, and collaboration into their day-to-day work. ‍ Systems-level impact : Beyond individual products or services, we help redesign how organizations make decisions, build culture, and create long-term resilience. Through this approach, IDEO has helped global enterprises, startups, and social sector organizations reimagine business models, improve customer experiences, and lead transformational change—all grounded in empathy and creativity. Which industries does IDEO work with? IDEO works across industries and sectors, helping organizations of all kinds design new value—whether that means reimagining products and services, creating more human-centered systems, or shaping the future of work, education, and the planet. ‍ Our multidisciplinary teams bring design, strategy, and foresight to a wide range of fields, including: ‍ Healthcare and life sciences: designing patient-centered care experiences, medical technologies, and health equity initiatives. ‍ Financial services: helping banks, fintechs, and insurers design trust, transparency, and better financial well-being. ‍ Education and learning : shaping learning systems, tools, and experiences for a rapidly changing world. ‍ Technology and AI: working with emerging technologies to ensure innovation is ethical, human-led, and responsible. ‍ Consumer goods and retail: rethinking products, packaging, and brand experiences for modern consumers. ‍ Public sector and social innovation : partnering with governments and nonprofits to design systems that serve communities more equitably. ‍ Climate and sustainability : creating circular systems and resilient solutions for climate-positive futures. ‍ While our work spans many industries, the common thread is people. IDEO’s human-centered, systems-aware approach helps any organization—regardless of sector—discover fresh opportunities for growth and positive impact. How is IDEO’s approach to design evolving in the era of AI and emerging technology? IDEO’s approach to design is evolving to meet the opportunities and responsibilities of an AI-driven world. While our foundation in human-centered design remains constant, the way we explore, prototype, and create is expanding toward designing with technology, not just for it. ‍ From human-centered to human–AI collaboration For decades, IDEO has designed around human needs. Now, we’re also designing for human–machine partnerships—systems where AI augments creativity, supports decision-making, and extends human capability. We focus on making emerging technologies more intuitive, trustworthy, and equitable, ensuring they serve real human and societal needs. ‍ Expanding the designer’s toolkit AI allows IDEO designers to explore new forms of prototyping, scenario modeling, and systems foresight. We use generative tools to imagine future possibilities faster, while maintaining human judgment and ethical reflection at the core of our process. This helps organizations navigate complexity, bias, and change with intention. ‍ Designing responsibly As technology grows more powerful, so does the importance of design ethics. IDEO integrates principles of responsible innovation—transparency, inclusivity, and long-term impact—into every engagement. We help partners move beyond efficiency and novelty, toward design that strengthens human and planetary well-being. What makes IDEO different from other design consultancies? IDEO is different from other design consultancies because we don’t just design things—we design the conditions for innovation itself. ‍ Our work goes beyond creating products or services; we help organizations transform how they think, collaborate, and grow. For us, design is not a deliverable; it’s a mindset and a way of driving meaningful change. ‍ 1. A legacy of human-centered design IDEO pioneered human-centered design and design thinking, approaches that have reshaped how the world solves problems. We start with people—their needs, motivations, and aspirations—and use those insights to guide everything from product design to systems transformation. 2. Interdisciplinary creativity Our teams blend expertise in design, business strategy, technology, and the social sciences, bringing multiple perspectives to complex challenges. This interdisciplinary collaboration allows us to uncover connections others might miss and to design solutions that work across systems, not just within silos. ‍ 3. Prototyping and experimentation at the core We believe the best way to learn is by making. IDEO prototypes ideas early and often—testing them in the real world, gathering feedback, and iterating fast. This approach reduces risk while accelerating innovation. ‍ 4. A commitment to impact From healthcare to climate, from education to AI ethics, IDEO’s work aims to create positive, lasting impact for people, organizations, and the planet. We measure success not just by growth, but by the value and meaning we create along the way. Learn more about IDEO and what it’s like to partner with us Subscribe Want more IDEO in your life?
