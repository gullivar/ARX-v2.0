No Bullsh*t Trusted by 10+ Million Developers With FusionAuth, all plans, you can keep adding as many Identity Providers as you want at no extra cost - this was our main issue with other CIAM providers as they demand increasingly unreasonable fees David Krizanic Head of Architecture @ Com Laude We were using Auth0 before FusionAuth and, although it had great features, it could be a bit confusing, mainly when talking about roles, scopes, permissions etc. At scale, Auth0’s pricing was outrageous. Danilo Polani Senior Software Engineer @ WeRoad The implementation is so much more intuitive than Auth0. I can run it on my own infrastructure and out of the box it supports everything I need. And more! Jason Musyj Co-Founder & CTO of Unio The FusionAuth team has been extremely helpful. They really give you the attention you need to solve any identity challenge. Danny Davis Wonder Giant FusionAuth is an amazing product. Tons of features and the support is the best in the industry. Marc Pearson IT Consultant I achieved in a single day's work what took a week and a half with Gluu. FusionAuth is just that simple to use. Mike Rees Growth Partners It's a huge win for us that we can self-host FusionAuth. Not only do we have extremely low latency for API calls, but also no rate limits. We were previously with Auth0 and their APIs and UIs were rate limited. This often made them horrifically slow.
