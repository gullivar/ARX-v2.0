Read More Who can use Localtonet Localtonet's services are available to anyone who needs to securely access their local web server from the internet. This can include DevOps professionals, web developers, web designers, and even gamers who may need to access a local server to run game servers or test game modifications. Can I use the same account in more than one device? Yes, Localtonet allows users to use their account on multiple devices, but it is important to note that a separate token is required for each device. Users can generate a unique token for each device they wish to use with their Localtonet account. What is reserve ports? A reserved port is a fixed port number that is assigned to a specific service or application on a computer network. When a user creates a tunnel to access a local web server through Localtonet's secure tunnel service, they can reserve a specific port number to ensure that it remains consistent every time they activate the tunnel. Can I cancel my plan? Localtonet allows users to cancel their plan at any time directly from their account dashboard. If a user wishes to apply for a refund, they can do so by contacting Localtonet's customer support team and submitting a request along with a valid reason that justifies the refund. Have Questions?
