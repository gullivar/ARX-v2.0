The race was organized in 1945, and its status has been constantly changing. In 2004, the race received its current category, and since then, it has been held regularly. The men’s Tour of Britain 2025 took place between September 2 and 7. Within these six days, the racers passed through dozens of towns and cities, so fans had numerous chances to appreciate their skills live and catch all the action from the roadside. The tour proved to be more difficult than in the previous years, as its total distance reached 886 km with 7,500 m of elevation gain. The full Tour of Britain 2025 route was officially confirmed and announced on September 1, although the initial start and finish details were revealed earlier in August 2025. French rider Romain Grégoire emerged as the overall winner, showcasing consistent performance throughout the week. The event attracted a strong international interest and gathered large crowds along the route, reinforcing its status as the UK’s most prestigious road cycling race. Furthermore, the Tour of Britain often serves as a key part of riders’ preparation for the UCI Road World Championships, which typically take place later in September. With just a couple of weeks between these two events, the Tour provides an ideal opportunity for riders to test their form, gain racing rhythm, and adapt to competitive intensity ahead of the global season finale. Tour of Britain 2025 and Its Impact on the Popularity of Cycling in the UK Cycling events in Europe have largely been more popular in France, Spain, and Italy thanks to the presence of races like the Tour de France. They form part of the Grand Tour, which requires riders to go through some extremely tough stages before getting the ultimate glory. Professional cycling events in Britain have not attained the same popularity, but several changes to the Tour of Britain still made a big impact and brought many new fans into the sport. After all, the Tour of Britain is the most popular professional cycling race in the United Kingdom. Tour of Britain – A Peek into the History The previous Tour of Britain took place in 2024, and this was the 20th edition of the event. First, the race was held in 1945 – much later than the Tour de France. There was a brief hiatus after the 1999 edition. Following several restructures, the event resumed in 2004 and underwent major changes to make it competitive on the international front. Even though post-2004 editions often featured eight stages, the number of Tour of Britain stages was reduced to six in 2024. The 2024 edition of the Tour of Britain took place from 3 to 8 September, covering the route across England, with a total distance of approximately 943.9 km. The race featured a mix of flat sprint stages and hilly terrains, offering challenges for both sprinters and climbers. Several top-tier teams delivered strong performances throughout the week, with INEOS Grenadiers, UAE Team Emirates, and Soudal Quick-Step consistently leading the pack. Their riders dominated key breakaways and controlled the peloton on crucial climbs and sprint finishes, making the 2024 Tour a thrilling and competitive edition. Since coming into the UCI Europe Tour, the Tour of Britain route has become much more complex, with a large predominance for early stages. Twenty teams took part in the 2015 edition, which featured a mix of terrain formats. The event was dominated by three teams – Team Sky, Movistar Team, and Etixx-Quick-Step. Even though they managed to grab individual stages, Cannondale-Garmin managed to win the overall team classification by finishing 5′ 35″ ahead of Team Sky. Tour of Britain Women 2025 The 2025 edition of the Lloyds Tour of Britain Women took place from 5 to 8 June, marking a major return of the race after a two-year absence. The event showcased elite-level women’s road cycling and featured both UCI Women’s WorldTour and British Continental teams. The Tour of Britain 2025 route map for women was officially revealed in May 2025, outlining a four-day challenge across two regions of the UK. The opening two stages unfolded in North East England, while the final two moved into Scottish terrain. A standout feature of the race was the punishing finish of Stage 2 on Saltburn Bank – a 300-metre climb with an average gradient of 11% that has gained notoriety from its previous inclusion in the British National Road Race Championships. This blend of coastal sprints and steep inclines made for a dynamic and demanding parcours, testing riders’ versatility and endurance throughout the event. The race began in Dalby Forest and concluded with a dramatic criterium stage in Glasgow, with thousands of fans lining the roads throughout the weekend. New Zealand rider Ally Wollaston (FDJ–Suez) secured the overall win by claiming vital time bonuses during the final stage, overtaking early leader Cat Ferguson (Movistar Team) by just four seconds. 2025 Tour of Britain Women – Final General Classification Rank Rider Country Team Time GAP 1 Ally Wollaston NZL FDJ-Suez 10h 36′45″ – 2 Cat Ferguson GBR Movistar 10h 36′49″ +4s 3 Karlijn Swinkels NED UAE Team ADQ 10h 37′07″ +22s Ferguson impressed throughout the race, including a victory on stage three in Kelso, and finished second overall while also taking home the points and young rider classifications.
