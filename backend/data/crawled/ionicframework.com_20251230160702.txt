The Ionic VS Code Extension can help follow best practices and perform common tasks from within your editor

On-Device Hot Refresh

Speed up your process by developing right on device and making use of Hot Refresh to see your changes applied instantly.

JS Agnostic
Use the JavaScript tech you prefer.

We don’t make assumptions about the JS Frameworks you prefer to build with. That’s why we engineered Ionic to integrate seamlessly with all best frontend frameworks, including Angular, React, Vue, or even no framework.

Get started:
ionic/vue
ionic/react
ionic/angular
Performance obsessed
Build apps that are fast by default.

Ionic is built to perform fast on the all of the latest mobile devices. Build apps with a small footprint and built-in best practices like hardware accelerated transitions, touch-optimized gestures, pre-rendering, and more.

Start building →
import { Filesystem, Directory, Encoding } from '@capacitor/filesystem';


const writeFile = async (text: string) => {
  await Filesystem.writeFile({
    path: "secrets/text.txt",
    data: text,
    directory: Directory.Documents,
    encoding: Encoding.UTF8,
  });
};


writeFile("Capacitor is really cool!");
import { Camera, CameraResultType } from '@capacitor/camera';


const takePicture = async (element: HTMLElement) => {
  const image = await Camera.getPhoto({
    quality: 90,
    allowEditing: true,
    resultType: CameraResultType.Uri
  });


  var imageUrl = image.webPath;
  element.src = imageUrl;
};


const img = document.getElementById("my-photo");
takePicture(img);
import { Share } from '@capacitor/share';


const shareCapacitorUrl = async () => {
  await Share.share({
    title: 'Capacitor is cool!',
    text: 'Really awesome thing you need to see right meow',
    url: 'http://capacitorjs.com/',
    dialogTitle: 'Share with buddies',
  });
}


shareCapacitorUrl();
Seemless native integration
Connect to native when you need it.

Access full native device functionality with JavaScript. Choose from a library of native device plugins for Camera, Maps, Geolocation, Bluetooth, and more. Dive into the full native SDKs at any time—there’s no limit.

Filesystem

Save and read documents, assets, and other content

Camera

Capture photos, save images, and configure hardware settings

Share

Share content in any share-enabled app a user has installed

Write once. Run anywhere.

Deploy your Ionic apps directly to iOS and Android app stores using the Capacitor bridge and cross-platform plugin APIs.

Custom plugin development

Creating custom native experiences is easy with a simple Plugin API for Swift on iOS, Java on Android, and JavaScript for the web.

Build & deploy in the cloud

Generate native builds, push live app updates, publish to the app stores, and automate the whole process with Ionic Appflow.

Infinitely Customizable
UIs that feel at home wherever they are deployed.

Start with pre-built iOS and Material Design themes that use Adaptive Styling to display correctly on the platforms they’re rendered on, or easily tailor the components and create custom UIs that match your brand.

I love building apps with Ionic and Capacitor because you can build UI that looks amazing, all with web technologies and a little plugin magic. As a user, I would never know this wasn’t a “native” app.

Nicole Sullivan

@stubbornella

Your care and attention to detail shows in @Ionicframework components. And your commitment to interoperability with frameworks is 💯

Abimael Barea

@abimaelbarea

There are many options to build cross-platform apps. Still, the approach of @Ionicframework using web components, css variables, multi framework support, and now a straightforward integration with native code using Portals it's pretty impressive.

Einfach Hans

@einfach_hans_

I'm 23 years old and already can say:@Ionicframework changed my life. I'm proud to be able to describe myself as an Ionic Expert/Senior in my young age 👍🏻

Marius Bolik

@MariusBolik

I refactored my cryptocurrency app in under a month using @Ionicframework & @capacitorjs.

Pato

@devpato

Starting playing with @Ionicframework again today. Holy shit! Things have changed in the past 4 years with Ionic. Excited to learn more and more about this awesome tool!

Angular

@angular

Angular + Ionic represent a huge percentage of App Store and Google Play downloads

Danny Redfern

@redders166c

Why on earth did I not jump in @Ionicframework and @capacitorjs earlier?! The ease of using native plugins is outrageous.

FK - Cloud Architect

@coderonfleek

You won't totally appreciate the work that the @Ionicframework team has done until you have read the entire docs. Such an amazing tool they have built

Maximilian

@maxedapps

Ionic is awesome! Building cross-platform apps has always been amazing with Ionic (and Capacitor) but Vue being Vue, it's of course super smooth and straightforward.

Steve Sanders

@StevenDSanders

One of the devs on my team added a fantastic dark mode to our new @Ionicframework app in less than a day of work. Absolutely insane how productive you can be in Ionic! Let's just say that adding dark mode to our native iOS app took a lot longer than a day.

Glenn Nickens

@GlennNickens

I luv @Ionicframework!

Alex Dobsom

@alexdobsom

It took me 50 minutes to realize how useful is @Ionicframework for building web, android & ios with @reactjsfrom a single code source (easier than React Native and React for Web) just listening to this podcast. Just WOW 😍

Veni Kunche

@venikunche

Love Ionic! Before I got the idea for Diversify Tech, I was making app templates using it.

Simon Grimm

@schlimmson

Tried @useappflow for @Ionicframework apps and must admit this stuff rocks 🔥 Cloud builds, automations and direct deploy to app store and Google Play - all configured basically within a morning 😱

Ire Aderinokun

@ireaderinokun

Guys, @Ionicframework is insaaaneee. I'm now a Mobile Developer 💅🏾

Adam Wathan

@adamwathan

Been pouring over the various @Ionicframework websites this afternoon just because they're so beautifully designed 😍

Sarah Drasner

@sarah_edo

Finally used Ionic to build an app, and wow- this is so much fun. Building with Vue, (they have React and Angular too) and it deploys on Web, iOS, and Android? I’m having delusions of app grandeur.

Parham

@_pazel

When a mobile app is successful, often the client asks us to build a web version so it's more accessible. Building with @Ionicframework and @capacitorjs has saved our clients and us a lot of time and money by enabling us to transform into a webapp with minimal effort.

vjeux

@Vjeux

Super excited about Ionic React! I’ve always dreamed of a “ruby on rails” equivalent for React where all the environment is setup to be productive right away.

Realm

@realm

Start with an @Ionicframework React web application and run it on #iOS and #Android. 📲

#Ionic and @capacitorjs make it super easy to run your Realm-powered Ionic apps everywhere! 🌏

Ben

@derbenoo

How do you build a fully functional chat on both Android and iOS with 2 devs (shout-out to @mitschmidt) in just 4 days? 😱

Yes you guessed it: @capacitorjs + @angular + @Ionicframework + @storybookjs

Matt Starr

@mb_starr

shoutout to @Ionicframework here for being part of the sane solution for 99.9% of the people. Thank you sir!

Joeycrack.Net

@Joeycrack_Net

The @Ionicframework and @angular framework is total for web/mobile development. I mean I was just building for android and ios and suddenly I decided I want a pwa and it didn't take me up to 5mins to create one with same codebase who does that? 😂🤣😂🤣😂 This stack is the shiit

Travis Ryan

@darkunderlord

I am absolutely blown away by how awesome The @Ionicframework Appflow works so well. This is a game changer for me as a developer.
