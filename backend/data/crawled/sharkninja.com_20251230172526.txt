Will my Pickle Pom SLUSHi? I’ve been craving pickles and pomegranates, so I tried combining the two in my ninjakitchen SLUSHi. #SponsoredByNinja

Of course pickle juice contains sodium and pomegranate juice has natural sugar, but it also has some surprising health benefits when enjoyed in moderation!

Health Benefits:

Pickle Juice: Good source of probiotics, contains sodium and potassium (both electrolytes) so it’s hydrating, vinegar helps regulate blood sugar

Pomegranate Juice: High in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, rich in antioxidants, packed with polyphenols which has been studied to help brain development in utero.

This unlikely pair might be my new go-to to beat the heat. Would you try it?? Link in bio to get yours #NinjaSlushi

Soft serve ice cream with a swirl used to be something I could only get outside of my house and the dairy-free flavors are often limited to vanilla and chocolate, if any. NinjaKitchen has changed the game with the new Ninja Swirl by CREAMi #SponsoredByNinja

Imagine being able to make the flavors of your dreams right from the comfort of your home? It’s possible now! I made a high-protein dairy-free soft serve matcha ice cream with 6 simple ingredients I already had at home. This little pint of ice cream contains 30g of plant-based protein and it’s sweetened with only 1 tablespoon of organic agave nectar. You can certainly use your sweetener of choice or not use any at all. I host at my home from time to time and I’m excited to see who has the best swirl technique at the next gathering! 
You can learn more about this incredible machine through the link in my bio.

Recipe:
3 tsp matcha powder dissolved in 4 tbsp of hot water
1 ¾ cups (1can) full fat coconut milk
1 tbsp melted coconut oil
1/8 tsp xanthan gum (this enhances the creaminess and helps to avoid crystallization)
1 scoop vanilla protein powder
1 tbsp agave nectar (optional)

Directions: Mix all the ingredients together, freeze for 24 hours in the Ninja container
