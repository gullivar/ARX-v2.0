Kong powers rapid AI innovation at enterprise scale

The AI opportunity: Winner takes everything

How you deploy AI will define the future of your business. And how you govern AI will define the future of your AI deployment. We already know that lack of visibility, fragmentation, and governance gaps are killing early AI programs.

95%

of AI initiatives go nowhere

84%

of companies report AI has eroded gross margins by more than 6%

$4.63M

average cost per Shadow AI breach to enterprises

But your AI program? It can thrive. Your business can drastically increase margins with AI. And you can unify security and visibility for all AI consumption — from the agent to the LLM to the API to the data itself.

How? By unifying fragmented AI, API, and event data ecosystems — all in one platform.

Fragmentation drives AI failure. AI connectivity drives AI success.

Fragmentation kills velocity. Fragmentation spawns security vulnerabilities. Fragmentation brings critical services down. Fragmentation blows through budgets.

Fragmentation suffocates innovation.

Get un-fragmented. Unify your AI cost, security, and risk posture with Konnect. And unleash AI innovation.

Cost governance challenge is fragmented visibility

Organizations breached don't have AI governance

Organizations are completely blind to their AI data flows

With Kong
Everything AI connectivity — all in one platform.

No matter what AI-powered applications you're building — and no matter fuels them — they need AI fuel to do their jobs well. That fuel could be APIs. It could be LLMs and MCP servers. And it could be real-time data and events.

No matter what you build, and no matter what fuel it needs, Kong is the AI connectivity layer connecting it all.

Ship compliant AI products

H&M pivoted from a fragmented AI governance model to a secure, unified, and scalable platform. They shrunk the onboarding time for new AI services from weeks to days, and rolled out financial oversight. They also reduced LLM operational costs through intelligent routing and centralized rate limiting and 100% centralized logging and auditability for all AI traffic to meet compliance requirements.
