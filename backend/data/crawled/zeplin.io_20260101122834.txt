Zeplin is for clear, structured delivery. Get started Watch demo 4:57 Watch demo A letter from our CEO Here is the problem: Design tools are made for DESIGNING. Design tools are creative spaces — freeform, fast-moving, always evolving. That’s what makes them great. But it’s not where devs belong . They don’t want to click around a live file hoping they’re looking at the final version. They don’t want to dig through frames to figure out how the pieces connect, understand what every element is supposed to do. We’ve seen this mess play out over and over again — at startups, agencies, Fortune 500 teams. Design tools just let it happen. Devs want clarity. Devs want structure. Devs want confidence. Design tools are not built for delivery. That’s why we built Zeplin. Because design delivery is a phase of its own. And it deserves its own space — outside the canvas. Pelin Kenez CEO & Co-founder, Zeplin Everything your team needs for design delivery Finalize designs Track design changes Organize designs Document designs Gather feedback Manage design system Tailored design specs Finalize designs Track design changes Organize designs Document designs Gather feedback Manage design system Tailored design specs Separate ready-for-dev designs from in-progress work Track design changes deliberately Keep every project structured Communicate the complete user journey Review and approve designs with clarity Connect your design system to real product work Specs that match your development stack Separate ready-for-dev designs from in-progress work Once designs are ready for dev, select and publish frames from any design tool. Zeplin becomes your stage for presenting final designs—without the distraction of ongoing design changes. Track design changes deliberately Inspired by Git, Zeplin brings deliberate versioning to design. Each screen has its own version history, capturing changes over time so teams can review and compare when needed. Keep every project structured Standardize how designs are organized across your team. With a consistent structure, everyone can quickly find what they need and collaborate effectively. Communicate the complete user journey Map out end-to-end user flow with purpose-built journey mapping tools: connectors, labels, and shapes designed to build complex flows easily. Document requirements in context Mockups alone don’t tell the full story. Add notes and requirements directly on the designs so devs understand how things should work, not just how they look. Review and approve designs with clarity Request reviews when screens are ready, track decisions, and keep discussions organized. Build alignment without confusing comment threads. Instant feedback with AI Scan designs with AI Design Review, catching off-system colors, spacing inconsistencies, typos, and accessibility issues before sharing with devs. Connect your design system to real product work Share and maintain your design system components and token in Styleguides, linked to day-to-day projects. Devs can see exactly which components and tokens to use, promoting adoption. Specs that match your development stack Generates accurate measurements, assets, and code snippets tailored to your team’s dev stack. Connect designs to dev tools like Jira and Storybook to keep everyone in sync. Generate real, usable code from designs Turn designs into real, usable code. Zeplin MCP server looks at both your designs and documentation to generate code that match how your team actually builds.
