David Tieba Head of Product Analytics "LaunchDarkly is super fast and reliable. I can change a flag status in LaunchDarkly and see it reflected in our mobile apps instantly. I’ll pay for that any day." Artie Lee Director of Engineering "LaunchDarkly has enabled self-serve experimentation at CCP. You don’t have to be a data scientist to run valid, actionable experiments. This is unbelievably powerful." Nick Herring Technical Director of Infrastructure "From 2020 to 2023, we had a massive 97% reduction in overnight and weekend releases, while enjoying a 300% increase in production deployments.” Nathan Gray Director of Digital Engineering Operations "LaunchDarkly enables us to roll out features quickly, which allows us to collect user feedback early, measure system performance, and keep iterating on a feature until it yields the maximum results." Justin Cataldo VP of Engineering "We use LaunchDarkly to release new features to a subset of our guests, gather responses, fine-tune our approach & validate new features in production to be able to deliver a better experience for all travelers.” Manjari Ranganathan IT Manager "LaunchDarkly has given us much more flexibility than our previous tools for feature flagging and A/B testing. We’re able to experiment more effectively and make better data-driven decisions.” Rema Morgan-Aluko SVP Technology “LaunchDarkly has revolutionized our development process by streamlining feature flag activation, allowing our developers to focus on more critical tasks.” Sebastien Thibaud Lead Developer “LaunchDarkly unblocked a major bottleneck and allowed us to move forward with a continuous delivery process. Because of the speed that we achieved, we doubled that goal organically..” Greg Ratner CTO "The ability to target experiments and analyze results efficiently has been a game-changer for us. It’s enabled us to run more tests and gain actionable insights much faster. ” Riley Duncan Sr. Data Analytst Try out some flags on Toggle. enable-toggle-thumbs-up Try out some new poses. swap-shoe-color Find Toggle’s best look with A/B testing.
