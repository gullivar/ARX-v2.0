Hypixel SkyBlock 0.24 - The Greenhouse

​
Today we are releasing Hypixel Skyblock 0.24, which features the Greenhouse, a new plot that can be placed in your Garden. This update also includes 3 new crops, a revamp to Farming Tools, a new Chip System, Crop & Visitor milestone nerfs, and much more!

► Greenhouse

The Greenhouse is a new placeable plot in the Garden that lets you plant, water, and grow crops over multiple real-life hours or days whether your are online or offline. The goal is to offer a slower, more passive alternative to farming crops actively, while still contributing to your Garden progression (including crop milestones).

Instead of spending a lot of hours farming directly, you’ll be able to plan out your Greenhouse, water your crops, and check back later for the results.

Also, it introduces new content through the mutation system, but more on that below.

So let’s dive a bit deeper on how the Greenhouse will work in the Garden.

Dev Blog #13 - A look at Ravengard


Hello Everyone! My name is Kazius, and I am the Lead Designer and Project Manager for Hypixel Ravengard.

In this design (dev?) blog, I'd like to go over what Ravengard is in detail to keep you guys in the loop! Ravengard is a PvPvE loot extractor multiplayer game. The concept of the game is not something everyone will be familiar with; however, many of you will recognize the signs.

The goal is simple - crawl through the dungeon, get as much loot as you can, defeat dangerous creatures, and leave with your loot. However, whether you are exploring catacombs, dangerous forests, or demon-infested ruins, you will also have to deal with other groups of players. Will you work with your fellow explorers, or will you defeat the others and claim their loot?

Before we go further, please note that Ravengard is currently still in early development and everything we're about to show you here is subject to change!
