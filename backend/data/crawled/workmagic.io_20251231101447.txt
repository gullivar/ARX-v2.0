Our methodology
Geo Incrementality Testing

By selecting comparable geographic areas, WorkMagic helps brands create test and control groups for in-market experiments, measuring the incremental impact of marketing channels or campaigns.

Incrementality-Adjusted Attribution

By automatically running incrementality tests and refining data-driven attribution models with test signals, WorkMagic provides the most accurate and reliable measurement of your marketing performance.

Incrementality-calibrated MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling)

Beyond measurement, WorkMagic integrates incrementality test results into MMM, providing actionable insights that help brands optimize media budgets across channels and refine strategies for profitable growth.

What sets us apart
Fully Automated Incrementality Testing

Unlike other solutions that require manual configurations and back-and-forth adjustments, WorkMagic automates the entire testing process, from eligibility checking to test design, hold-out setup, and result calibration.

Measure Marketing Halo Effect

WorkMagic measures the true impact of marketing efforts on all sales channels, including not just DTC but also its halo effect on Amazon, wholesale, retail, and more.

Seamless and Easy Onboarding

Setup takes just a few clicks, with WorkMagic's integration with Shopify for first-party tracking and other data sources like marketing channels and marketplaces. Brands can finish account setup in 10 minutes and launch the first test in a week.

The Only Incrementality-Calibrated Attribution & MMM

WorkMagic is the only platform that calibrates attribution and Media Mix Model (MMM) models with incrementality tests, providing enhanced accuracy, greater granularity, and truly actionable insights for your brand.

Actionable Insights for Budget Allocation

Beyond measurement, WorkMagic provides insights about the optimal daily ad spending for each marketing channel, as well as the budget allocation strategies to drive sales, iROAS, and profitable ad spending—all based on the accurate incrementality testing results for success.

WorkMagic is the first player I've seen pair an attribution model that's customized to a brand with incrementality testing. It has helped us significantly improve our confidence in attribution.

Super excited about WorkMagic, we have not found a tool that can provide us with even semi-accurate attribution by channel, not to mention sharing insight on incrementality and halo-effect. Work Magic ticks all these boxes with a best-in-class margin of error
