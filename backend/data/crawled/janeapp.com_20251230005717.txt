ONLINE BOOKING

Jane’s most talked-about feature, developed to be incredibly easy for patients to book and manage their visits.

SCHEDULE

Enjoy a well-organized day. Jane's scheduling helps you manage your time, letting you focus on what really matters — your patients or clients.

BILLING

Bill your visits and accept payments in just a couple of clicks, and have Jane do all the math for you – even if you're billing insurers.

CHART

We've helped hundreds of clinics switch to Jane. Our team can import scanned chart notes, patient lists, and guide you in customizing chart templates.

“Jane Family, you guys are really awesome. Keep the amazing new features coming.

I love how you consistently make this clinic software better and better by the month! WOW!”

— Sue Shalanski, Reach Physio, Squamish BC

Jane is always available, anytime, anywhere.
What a difference a web-based program makes. Connect with clients, staff and all your files from any location on any device.
Staff & Owners are happy.
Jane can help with administrative tasks, giving you more time back in your day. Plus, because Jane runs online, there is no need for inconvenient updates.
Extra hands

Jane does the work of a full-time staff person, including sending patients reminders by email & SMS which frees up front desk staff to do other things.

Real-time booking

When a patient books an appointment online, front-desk staff see it immediately so there’s no risk of double booking.

Simple billing

In a few clicks, accept credit cards, issue receipts, track insurance billing, and direct bill to a number of insurers. Ridiculously easy.

Secure

Forget inputting data into multiple programs, Jane stores (and password protects) every file so it’s safe, sound and accessible from anywhere.

Your patients will be happy too.
Clients can book online, access helpful exercises from their therapist, and get reimbursed from insurance companies with no paperwork.

Easy booking

In a few clicks, clients can book one or multiple visits with their favourite practitioner. Works on a computer, tablet or phone!

Automated reminders

Email and text reminders keep your patients’ appointments top of mind, helping to cut down on no-shows and make your schedule more predictable.

Simple check-in

Front desk staff mark when a client has arrived and – whoosh – the practitioner gets a notification so they know to finish up.

Hassle free claims

Jane makes the complex world of insurance as simple as possible with intuitive ways to track and submit 3rd party billings.

A serious problem-solver. That’s Jane.
See the difference the right software can make in your clinic.
Being affordable matters to Jane.

Jane’s pricing is based on the number of practitioners in your clinic – so it always fits your budget. No extra programs are needed to run your clinic.

There's a powerhouse team behind Jane.

Jane was created by people who operate multiple clinics and people who specialize in simple, intuitive design. Our team truly understands clinic management and easy-to-use software.

Jane stores your clinic's medical data in country.

Your practice’s data is stored in one of our regional data centers (USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia). This is essential to ensure your clinic is acting in accordance with local privacy legislation.

Bring your own device.

Jane works great on tablets, smart phones, laptops and desktop computers of any flavor: Android, Apple, or Microsoft.

Jane offers unlimited support.

Cloud-based software means there are no programs to install and no costly IT people to call. Jane will help get you started and will be by your side whenever you need assistance.

Jane works in clinics of every type and size.

Jane was specifically created for interdisciplinary clinics – so just one program works perfectly for everyone from physios and massage therapists to counsellors and midwives.

No one has features like Jane.

With Jane, chart privately or share with the whole clinic. Add video or photos to capture a patient’s condition. Book multiple appointments at once. Let Jane automatically schedule to avoid awkward gaps in practitioners’ schedules. And so much more.

A beautiful design, with simplicity in mind.

Jane’s intuitive design ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for you and your staff — that even your patients will love.

Jane is lovingly made and supported by a remote-first team. While home will always be 🇨🇦 North Vancouver, we're spreading our wings and growing across the country (and the world!).
