How to release fraud rules safely
Releasing new fraud rules is a risky moment in fraud operations, as one small mistake can degrade performance, block legitimate customers, or introduce hidden system bugs. This post outlines a complete six-step rule-release process that fraud teams can use to minimize those risks. The process covers offline and online backtesting, expert review, shadow-mode validation, live accuracy checks, and long-term monitoring. Each step is designed to prevent the two most common failure scenarios: rules that hit only good users or rules that miss fraud entirely. By following this structured approach, teams can confidently deploy new rules, reduce operational risk, and maintain strong system performance heading into 2026.

I've worked in Fraud and AML for a long time, but I've never worked with a customer support team that's so accessible and effective. Sardine is like an extension of our team.”
Preston Miller
Manager, Fraud and Chargebacks
My favorite Sardine feature is that I can create complex rulesets to catch new fraud patterns, and then test them against the last 30/60/90 days. If they perform well, I can instantly push them to production. That’s game-changing.”
