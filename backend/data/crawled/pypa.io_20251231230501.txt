set of software projects used in Python packaging. The software developed through the PyPA is used to package, share, and install
Python software and to interact with indexes of downloadable Python software
such as PyPI , the Python Package Index. Click the logo below to download pip, the most prominent software used to interact with PyPI. The PyPA publishes the Python Packaging User Guide , which is the authoritative resource
on how to package, publish, and install Python projects using current
tools . The User Guide provides a user introduction to packaging, and
explains how to use these tools. In case you need to package Python
with other languages (for example, in a scientific Python package),
the user guide also offers basic information about and links to
available third-party packaging options (for example, conda-forge ). For a listing of PyPA’s important projects, see the key projects
list . The PyPA hosts projects on GitHub ,
and discusses issues on the Packaging
category on discuss.python.org .
