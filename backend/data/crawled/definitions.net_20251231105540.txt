I know the history of KELG because I was the President and founder of the company that applied for the license of KELG and put the station on the air. When I attempted to enter the correct information, my entry was flagged by Facebook, although I had not knowingly posted it on Facebook. For the record, this was my post that was found to violate Facebook standards, and again, to be clear, I never posted it on Fascebook, yet I was told by Facebook that it violated community standrards... The FCC Call Sign KELG was originated by Fred Lundgren when he founded a company named Bastrop County Communications in 1976 and applied for the original license of the Elgin, Texas radio station. The license was granted in 1979. The station operated with a four tower parallelogram on 1440 AM with a directional array designed to put a city grade signal over Austin, Texas. Therefore, KELG stands for K-Elgin and is not related to the non-description in definitions.net. more » Like Reply 5 6 years ago Fred Lundgren STANDS4 It was impossible for me to navigate.
