In just a few minutes, you'll see how our software is purpose built for the realities of client work, connecting projects, time, resources, budgets, and reports, and powered by AI where it really counts. So picture this, a client brief is approved and it's time to create a project. You can build it manually by choosing from prebuilt templates and customize them for your needs, or let the AI project wizard work its magic, turning scattered briefs into a fully built project in just clicks. Faster setup means less admin and more time delivering for clients. Next, you need to match the right people to do the work. In the resource scheduler, you can easily assign work for future projects. And this is where AI can take on the heavy lifting. The AI smart scheduler will review the assignments and instantly find the best people based on role and availability and break the assignments into ready made tasks mapped to timelines. You can then review and refine before locking in. In the workload planner, you can quickly see who's doing what, making it simple to check capacity, adjust workloads, and reassign tasks as projects evolve. Tracking project costs can be messy. With teamwork dot com, you set billable and cost rates for your team, add a budget, and get an instant view with alerts before overspending becomes a problem. Time tracking is the key to staying on top of costs and capacity. Use our built in stop start timer that runs in the background while you work. When you're done, add a quick description and mark if the time is billable. Prefer to log later? Add time retroactively or in bulk with the time sheet. And for managers, automated reminders means no more chasing those time sheets. With time and budgets now in check, reports pull everything together for simple, powerful analysis, helping you stay proactive versus reactive. The project health report shows task progress, budget usage and status at a glance. Utilization reveals how effectively your team is working, who's at capacity, who has room for more and how close you are to hitting productivity goals. And the game changer, our AI Forecaster gives instant profitability predictions based on your historical revenue and costs. So you spend less time crunching numbers and more time making data driven decisions that boost your bottom line. This is just a glimpse of what teamwork dot com can do.

They've been using teamwork ever since they started to manage projects, but not to its full potential. I would literally handwrite everyone's schedules and take a picture of it and send it out on Slack. You did what? So what changed? There was a pivotal moment at the agency where we brought on an account that really required us to hire staff. We essentially doubled in size almost overnight, and we realized that onboarding had to change, processes had to change. So now you're really cooking with teamwork. I think the smartest way we use it is in how we project out how much work we're going to have, not just in the next week, but for months to come. As soon as we start to look at bandwidth and we make those decisions based on people's future utilization, we know when people are going to be going through a really busy couple of weeks or a really busy couple of months, and we're able to scale back on some of those other initiatives that we're able to prioritize because we're able to make people happier at work when we know what's going to hit them all at the same time. You know what they say? Happy team, happy life. So everyone gets a general overview of teamwork when they join. Logging time is one of those big ones we like to talk about immediately. One of the first things that they are introduced to is teamwork. It's how we use all of our time logging capabilities. So just getting comfortable in it for the first couple of weeks is really important. Every month I'm looking back at reports to say, here's how much time we actually had available to use. Here's what we estimated and here's how much time we actually leverage. It allows us to be able to make adjustments to how we structure our billing, how we structure our contracts. So you're getting all those awkward conversations out of the way real quick. Bringing clients in to teamwork is typically a very streamlined process. We do it for all of our QC. It's really allowed us to create those trusting relationships and continue to give them the clarity that they need for their business to be able to move forward with us as their agency. I spend all day, every day in teamwork, whether that is checking off tasks and making sure tattoos are done, running reports, looking at time logs, resource management really holistically, being able to dive deeper into project budgets and make forecasting make smarter decisions for the projects. It has gone from a task management tool to truly our holistic project management software. The mission statement of our project managers is to create clarity out of chaos, and I don't know. That would be possible without something like teamwork to really take the dozens of ongoing projects that we have at any given time and be able to put them all in the right place. And how they work together. I don't think you can beat that. To help us report. Better leave it to Jeremy. I told you. I love you, Jeremy. I love you. Your allergies, your. Your cramping, my style. Transcript for the video 'Kyle Duford - The Brand Leader': We recently utilized the budget feature with one particular client and wanted to hire us just for a few hours of a brainstorm session. We tracked the brainstorming time in that meeting itself, and then the subsequent meetings and we knew by the end of it, hey, we only have an hour left of time before this isn't profitable anymore. By understanding our cost centers and the cost per person per project were now more profitable and more efficient. And when I saw that happen, that's when we really knew like this thing's not only sticky for us, but it's really the right tool to run our business. Transcript for the video 'OIC Advisors': - Teamwork is that tool set that gives you the ability to surface what your team is working on, how much time it's taking them to do it, who they are doing it for, and what that all up work is costing the organization. My name's Bernard Williams. I am the CTO with OIC Advisors Incorporated. At OIC Advisors, we provide strategic consulting services with the intent of helping organizations improve operational velocity. As we looked out across the landscape of IT project management solutions and professional service applications, what we found was that there's a lot of solutions out there. Some are very expensive, and they have a lot of capabilities, too many sometimes. Teamwork.com was really kinda like the Goldilock version. It was just right. The insights and the visibility that Teamwork provides is one of the key features that we love about it. Teamwork has enabled us to be able to, first and foremost, make our work visible. We wanted to be able to understand, you know, who was doing what work, how much that work was costing us, and Teamwork has given us that ability. It has provided the insights that we need to make the business decisions that will help us thrive and survive over the coming years. Partnering with Teamwork was absolutely the right decision for our team. Transcript for the video 'Invanity Marketing': Before switching to teamwork dot com, Invanity Marketing's team were drowning in sixteen hour task days. In our previous tool, any time that hadn't been marked as completed in the past was automatically pushed into your current day. Every day you'd wake up, people's tasks would be at, like, sixteen hours because everything's just getting pushed forward and it used to take a long time to to clean out. So another bonus point for the the scheduling tool in in Teamwork, we've just been able to drag and drop and move things around. It's computer. Most agencies talk about efficiency. Few actually know if the work's profitable. We need to make sure we're delivering on time. The projects are moving through the agency efficiently. We've got, you know, creative copywriters, web developers, and we need to make sure that everyone's workloads are set up to help deliver on all the different variant projects that we've got. All those sorts of metrics that you can probably expect from an operation side of the business, I can pull from Teamwork, and it can also support the the client services side of things whereas how quickly are we delivering work to what standard and and how are people's workloads being scheduled. Rolling out a new tool in an agency can feel like pulling teeth. It was a lot easier than I thought. And part of that, I think, was the Teamwork's kind of UI and usability, but also the fact that the team here were just so happy to be moving away from the current solution. They were just really keen to get into something different, and they wanted to make sure that it worked for us as a business. So they were doing everything they could to to demonstrate that this was something that we wanted to keep. No insight, no control. That's why teamwork dot com became mission critical for Infanity Marketing. Without Teamwork, I would not know a lot in terms of profitability, reconciliation. I would not know that information. It is like the main source of of that insight in how we're working. FAQs How is Teamwork.com different from other project management tools?
