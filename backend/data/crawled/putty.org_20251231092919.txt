Mike Yeadon: Final Warning Welcome. This page has been experiencing publicity, so I'm using it for a cause which I believe will serve the common good. This is the latest interview with Mike Yeadon. "I am a lifetime research scientist. I worked for 32 years in the pharmaceutical industry and biotech. My most senior positions were at Pfizer. I was Vice President and Worldwide Head of Research in allergic and respiratory diseases. Since 2020 I have been speaking out against the fraudulent pandemic and the intentionally dangerous injections and my experience has been to have been censored and smeared. If you have not heard of me before, that's the reason. The censorship and smearing is the experience of people who are trying to tell you true things that the authorities don't want you to hear." The picture link is to Odysee – my favorite for uncensored content. Other sources: Mike Yeadon: Final Warning on X/Twitter Mike Yeadon: Final Warning on Telegram . You'll need the app: I recommend the side-loaded, uncensored version . Mike Yeadon: Final Warning on Rumble Mike Yeadon: Final Warning on YouTube . Fascinatingly, still up! YouTube usually deletes Mike's comments the moment they are posted.
