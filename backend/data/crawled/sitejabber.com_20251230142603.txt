Why our fans love us

“I only wish I had known about this website a long time ago. It’s awesome to be able to get it out to the public what many of the sites are about. Thanks, Sitejabber, for helping to open the book on scammers.”

Athena M.

“Sitejabber is a great website for writing reviews about various websites and businesses. I like this website more than Yelp and the other alternatives, because of its unique feature set and user interface.”

Aaron G.

“My go-to for website-company reviews. I can always find enough credible reviews that give me factual information, positive or negative, and it’s helped me greatly in my choice of so many businesses.”

Harry H.

“If you have ever been ripped off, lost money, or been hugely disappointed in the products of an online business, and you want to warn others-this is the PERFECT SITE! Alternatively, if you love an online business and want to encourage people that they can trust it, write a review on Sitejabber!”

Roseann Z.

“They have literally every brand you can think of on their website, even those brands you typically have a hard time finding reviews for. Reviewers often leave helpful tips, pictures and videos as well. I highly recommend this site!”

Melissa M.

“Sitejabber reviews have been extremely helpful to me. It has a really great set up to make it easy to find a website. AND, you can even connect with other users like social media and make friends if you want.”

Heather H.

“I love Sitejabber because I can read reviews about other websites and make informed decisions. It’s easy to use and find what you’re looking for. I like that I can build my own profile, write reviews and help other consumers.”

Nafia T.

“I love being able to read reviews from other consumers about companies that I’ve never heard of before and learning about new products from companies that I love buying products from!”

Samantha B.

“What I grew to enjoy was being able to connect with others on the website and sharing my own thoughts and opinions. Overall, I could not recommend this website more if you want an unbiased review on any brand or service.”

Recent insights for any business, from actual customers – the good, the bad, and everything in between

Michelle M. on Porch Potty
Good customer service

“After some initial glitches due to some broken parts (mostly cosmetic), we were able to repair our Porch Potty and install it on our back patio. Customer Service gave us some hints on using the Porch Potty with a dog that is already potty-trained. Our dog is somewhat finicky about where she is willing to go potty. I think that she'll adapt with additional practice, and her puppy will use it without a lot of coaxing, as he is still potty-training. The Customer Service reps are very responsive and helpful.”

Anne F. on FashionNova
Terrible service!

“Their customer service agents (if any) reply using templates that are unrelated to your question(s). They provide you with unhelpful answers which makes you wonder if anyone is really at the other end of the line. Plus, they use unreliable delivery services. Currently experiencing a delivery delay (hopefully a delay) with my last order. I reached out to them and they made no effort to look into the issue or communicate with this third party that they choose to do business with...My parcel has been in transit for 7 business days now. They referred me to the carrier... and how convenient was it to find out that the carrier's "Contact us" section doesn't work!”

Andrew L. on True Classic Tees
Fantastic shirts, fantastic customer service

“Bought 9 shirts that fit so well and feel so good that it will be hard for them not be my go-to shirts from now on. One shirt came with a stitching defect on the right sleeve which I took a picture of and emailed to customer service and in less than 24 hours without any question, I receive a shipping notification that a replacement is being sent out to me at no charge. Customer service reached out to me afterwards to ensure everything else met my expectations. As incredibly difficult it is these days to have good customer service from small and large companies alike, it was a breath of fresh air to have been helped by this team.”

Julie R. on PatPat
Love the products, but very slow to ship!

“I love the products! The only issue I have that will keep me from ordering is the turn around after placing an order is VERY slow! I placed multiple orders this Spring and just received all of my orders 8-10 weeks later! When selling baby products, 2+ months shipping is unreasonable.”

Anna Christina M. on PinkBlush
Super quick shipping, but quality could be better

“PinkBlush shipped out my package the day I put in the order. I received it two days later and I didn't even choose express! I was definitely impressed. I bought two dresses which were super cute, but to be honest, with what they're charging, I was expecting better quality. There were quite a few hem strings and the fabric on both dresses is thinner than I was expecting. I got these dresses on sale and with a gift card, but I don't think I'll be buying anything at full price.”

Chris. on etrailer
Found a better alternative for the 12 volt power feed!

“I purchased the trailer wiring harness for a 2015 Dodge Dart. I read all of the reviews and found that most people complained about having to route the 12 volt power feed from the battery. I spent a lot of time searching forums about this problem and finally found a solution. The manufacturer has a spare Red with Black tracer wire bundled in the rear driver side taillight wiring. The wire runs from the fuse box inside the engine compartment. You have to look for a wire that is capped with shrink tube.”

Daniel C. on Ticketmaster
A scam of the highest order

“I bought tickets for a birthday present, under the terms that the tickets would be mailed via UPS. Time passed. No tickets. The month of the show, they changed the tickets to Will Call, without notice or consent. I live out of state and cannot pick them up as it was never an event that I planned on attending. Now, due to their complete failure, the tickets are useless to me. Worse, they have the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. No phones. Just bots in a chat who refuse to acknowledge their mistakes, let alone fix them. No comps. They scammed me out of $600. Please I beg you to purchase tickets elsewhere. Ticketmaster is a dangerous company.”

David B. on Amazon
Great quality products at a good price

“I have been using amazon.com to get supplies and products for over a year now. While the customer service should be improved, I never had any problems regarding deliveries and product quality. Item always matched description, which is a plus. Personally would recommend given the price/quality ratio and the fast delivery.”

Don S. on Goldbelly
Love ordering from them!

“I do love ordering from you and do so quite frequently. This one did not work out. The food got delayed and arrived with the ice packs completely melted and the food spoiled. I do appreciate your customer service representative who quickly arranged to replace the food. I am awaiting that shipment now.”

Leigh O. on FASHIONPHILE
Always on point

“Every purchase I make from Fashionphile is so easy. They offer different ways to purchase if you don't want to pay in full upfront ( layaway and affirm) which I appreciate, and the description of the bag and its condition is always spot on, if not in fact better ( as they are very picky and detailed when describing the imperfections). I know exactly when my bag will arrive with the tracking email they send, which is helpful because I have to sign for it, and if for some reason I need to return it, they make that very seamless. Fashionphile is always my go-to site for vintage and resale bags.”

Maria B. on Canva
Wonderful website/ tools for creators

“I use Canva to create my personal and business Facebook Banners, Instagram promotion content, invoice creation, YouTube Banners and thumbnails, Planner Pages and sooo much more! Using Canva has helped me gain a much more professional presence online. There is both a free edition as well as a monthly/yearly membership option. You can also cancel anytime should you need to. There are so many things you can create on Canva and I love its easy to use format. Canva has tons of free, premade templates that are so easy to customize.”

Mike. on Fast Growing Trees
Nice plants, and great service!

“I was a little reluctant to order live plants over the internet but was pleasantly surprised. They came quickly and in good condition. Unfortunately, a couple of them didn't make it but the customer service was great in helping me try to save them, then ultimately ended up sending replacements. Everything is looking good now and I'm very happy with the process and results. Thanks.”

Natasha A. on MAC Cosmetics
Great Quality; Substandard Practices

“Love the quality, because not many cover the color wheel as effectively as this brand does, but their practices and stance on animal testing is sad. They use carmine for their reds; beetles have no place on my lips. Other ingredients are less than satisfactory too. Sad they don't devote enough resources to produce the same level of product without scary, cancer-causing ingredients. :(”

Nelson A. on Uber
Very unreliable

“I have a temp medical condition that prevents me from driving, still have to do errands. Taxis in my area are unreliable & don't take cards. So I thought I'd try Uber. Downloaded their app, entered info they asked for; scheduled a car, waited past due time, got a cancellation notice for no funds (I gave them my credit card); tried to re-schedule, same issue. Each time the notice gave an address 2 numbers off of mine but close so I know no car came. There is no way to contact anyone by phone or online to help resolve the issue. Never again.”

Nikita N. on Coinbase
My account got closed all of a sudden

“The services have been fine for a few months of using the app, until last week, when I received a notification of my account being closed, for violating terms of service. Support refused to provide more information claiming security reasons. Since I doubt that my account could have been more transparent - and they know that - I have to assume that there is something to hide behind the unwillingness to share the reasons for terminating the account. Possibly some discriminatory policies which they wouldn't like to disclose during these not-so-easy for them days. Well, good luck. As to anybody considering their services and reading this, be aware this may happen to you, even if you are sure of acting to the letter of the law”

Shelly T. on Shoedazzle
Not what I expected

“For whatever reason, the shoes are coming in too big, and the photos do not look like the shoes, so perhaps more description would be helpful. The price was one price, and the same shoe was for a lower price the next day. I put my points in thinking it would make the purchase more affordable - it did not, so I took my points off, and I have yet to get those points back in my total point balance.”

Sonya G. on Booking.com
Selective when publishing hotel reviews

“I have used booking.com on countless occasions to book hotel stays however, the ratings of some hotels are wholly inaccurate and do not reflect a lot of hotels. I have tried to write a review on every hotel stay however, booking.com do not publish the reviews and are very selective, thus it leads to a lot of misleading hotel ratings which then leads to very disappointing hotel stays. There needs to be a change in the policy so that all reviews are published provided you have booked and stayed, so that people can book accommodation that "accurately" reflects the reviews.”

Terry W. on Plenty Of Fish
Very poor follow-up after reporting about scammers

“Having used POF a number of times over the past decade, it now appears to be a simple scam to get people to pay for using the services, quite a few of the profiles are fake and when reporting them they still remain on the site, Also since I use a TV monitor and have no webcam and refuse to put the app on my phone they won't allow me access because I don't have a selfie although they were happy enough to accept my payment without one and of course now they refuse to refund funds paid, Best advice is not to use at all since most of it is just as phony as their other site Match.com”

William G. on Lamps Plus
Pleasant experience

“Order arrived quite quickly. One table was in excellent condition but the other one had been damaged in transit. One corner of the table top had been smashed and broken. I telephoned customer service and spoke with a very helpful lady who agreed to send me a replacement top forthwith. My communication with customer service was quite pleasant and helpful.”
