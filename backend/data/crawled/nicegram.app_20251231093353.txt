No, it’s a client built on the Telegram API — you use your existing Telegram accounts and chats, with added features for work, finance, and security. Is Nicegram affiliated with Telegram? No , we are independent and open-source. We stay fully compatible with official Telegram app updates, while remaining open to any Web3 protocol — not only TON. Is it safe? Yes — messages are encrypted and stored on Telegram’s servers. 
We don’t collect unnecessary data and follow a privacy‑first approach. See our Privacy Policy and GitHub for details. Who holds my wallet keys? We use account abstraction: your private key requires 2 out of 3 confirmations — your Telegram account, your unique password, and the unique Nicegram app installation on your device.
This means that if you change your phone, you can restore access to your wallet as long as you have access to your Telegram account and can enter your private password in the Nicegram Web3 Wallet. Which chains are supported? Supports multichain — including TON, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, Ethereum, Base, and other EVM-based networks. What are NiceID and NiceScore? NiceID is a soulbound identity anchored to your Telegram handle (currently in development). NiceScore is an SBT-based reputation built from deliveries, escrow history, and reviews. Identity and reputation help prevent impersonation and scam hires . Can scammers copy my profile? No — your NiceID, NiceScore, escrow proofs, or verified badges cannot be inherited by others. Suspicious behavior is down-ranked by fraud filters . What data do AI features use? Prompts and context you send to AI can be processed by selected model providers to deliver the feature. You control usage per chat and feature. 
See our Privacy Policy for details. Does Nicegram train AI on my messages? No — we do not use your personal chats to train any models, and we do not share your data with any partners. Is voice call recording legal? Laws vary by country and state (one-party vs two-party consent). 
You’re responsible for compliance and obtaining consent where required.
