The languages we speak or sign are at the very core of our human identity and integral to our ability to flourish in life. Tell me more SIL × Having the right information at the right time allows us to navigate life. It may be as inconsequential as thinking to grab an umbrella after reading a weather forecast. Or as critical as knowing how to protect your family in the midst of a pandemic. Ready access to information is essential to our ability to function and thrive in every aspect of life. However, for those who speak the world’s minority languages, even the most basic information is often inaccessible in a language they understand well. The resulting lack of life knowledge and skills results in poverty, poor nutrition, illness and even death. 25% of the world's people are left out because of language-related barriers. We partner with communities worldwide to develop language solutions to expand their possibilities for a better life.
