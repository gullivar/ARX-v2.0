Anime has ruined my life.
Ive been watching anime since 2011, (when I was 21) and its genuinely become an addiction. I cant stop watching it anymore. I dont fulfill my bodily needs because of it so its gotten to the point I need to wear a diaper and have hired a caretaker to clean my feces. Looking at the face of characters like Anya from Spy x Family make me ejaculate immediately without physical stimulation. If anybody has ideas on how to help my situation please let me know, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Any good anime I might haven't seen???
Damn I watched like 400 anime. Starting to think I watched all the good stuff. But I still didn't finish fate series, monogatari series and jojo.

Old isn't necessarily Good
Older anime aren’t ‘better’, you’re just nostalgic. if half of those shows dropped today, they’d get called slow, poorly paced, and “mid” by episode 3. People forgive bad animation, filler, and weak writing in old anime because they grew up with it — not because it was objectively good. New anime get judged harsher because audiences binge now and expect instant payoff. Nostalgia carries way more classics than fans want to admit.
