The twilight of the gods, Ragnarök, commences under Alfaðör, the creator of all.

Winter of annihilation... Wolf of annihilation... Sword of annihilation...

Dead gods rise as annihilation looms over the nine realms.

Fimbulvetr, the winter of annihilation, is first to descend—upon Nifl. Even the kingdom of snow and ice is not immune to the punishing winter of annihilation's icy grasp!

As the summoner, you and Alfonse, who has been entrusted with the power of Askr, the Divine Dragon, will confront Fimbulvetr alongside Princess Fjorm of Nifl.

Thou shalt demonstrate thy strength...and save the realms!

A world with two kingdoms: the Emblian Empire, which wishes to rule all worlds, and the Askran Kingdom, which stands in its way.

You are a summoner with the special ability to call upon legendary Heroes from different Fire Emblem worlds.
In order to save the Kingdom of Askr from destruction, join the Order of Heroes and face a never-ending challenge.

Kingdom of Ice, Nifl, and Kingdom of Flame, Múspell.
These kingdoms fought against each other, but Múspell's forces, led by the Ruler of Flame, Surtr, overwhelmed Nifl and brought the fighting to a bitter end.

Escaping her destroyed homeland, Fjorm, a Princess of Nifl, met the Order of Heroes in Askr.

With help from the Order of Heroes, Fjorm clings to the hope that she can restore her homeland, but the invading forces of Múspell have arrived in Askr...

The fierce battle with Múspell has ended and the Order of Heroes has returned to Askr. Not long after the party's return, however, they were attacked by soldiers from Hel, the realm of the dead.

As Alfonse and the others struggle to repel the forces of Hel, they encounter generals of the dead plucked from history—warriors who proclaim themselves the legendary rulers Líf and Thrasir.

Meanwhile, Hel, the sovereign who rules the realm of the dead, delivers a chilling order to her daughter, the princess Eir, regarding the Order of Heroes: "Join their army. Obey them, body and soul. Give yourself to them completely. Once you earn their trust...you can slaughter them at my command."

And thus Eir joined the Order. In her eyes, sorrow dwells deep, as she contemplates Hel's command...

With their struggle with the realm of the dead behind them, the Order of Heroes sets out to investigate a strange report out of a remote village. It's said that the residents of the village have fallen victim to unrelenting nightmares.

Upon their approach, Alfonse and the others quickly succumb to an unbearable drowsiness. In their half-conscious state, they are approached by Peony, a radiant light elf with the ability to conjure pleasant dreams.

With a new ally at their side, it's up to the Order of Heroes to fend off the dark elves and return to reality.

After narrowly escaping an unending nightmare brought on by the dökkálfar, the Kingdom of Askr comes under attack once more. This time, the Order of Heroes and the accompanying summoner are under siege by Reginn, princess of Niðavellir, the realm of the dvergar.

As Prince Alfonse struggles to overcome the attacking dvergr in her strong yet nimble seiðjárn armor, he senses a moment of hesitation in her assault. In that moment she pleads, "My brother, King Fáfnir, he's—Y-you have to stop him!"

And with that, the Order of Heroes joins forces with this otherworldly Princess Reginn in an attempt to end the war in Niðavellir.

Their conflict with Niðavellir behind them, the Order of Heroes sets out to investigate a mysterious darkness plaguing a village in their homeland of Askr. During their search, the Order comes across Princess Veronica, who reports a similar phenomenon happening in Embla.

With the assistance of a new ally in the form of Ash, retainer to the Divine Dragon Askr, Prince Alfonse and the others work to track down their suspected source of the encroaching dark: the dragon Embla.

Despite her good intentions and willingness to assist the Order, Veronica is compelled by Embla to bring about an end to all who stand with Askr. Now the Order must fight for a future in which the people of Askr and Embla can stand side by side.

The Order of Heroes finally have the sorceress Gullveig on her heels! But just when it seems Gullveig has been defeated, she manipulates time and revives herself, turning the tide on the Order of Heroes. The Order is on the verge of annihilation when...

A familiar voice calls out...

You open your eyes and are met with the face of the allies you had thought dead. As confusion reigns, the goddess Seiðr of Vanaheimr, the realm of light, appears before you.

Seiðr explains that what you have seen is a vision of the future, and she has come with a warning: the invasion of time is under way. Gullveig's forces are on the move.

The battle across time has arrived!

Askr and Embla now walk a path of peace—but in the days leading up to the formation of a formal alliance, a new group from Yggdrasill appeared and cast a shadow over everything.

Ratatoskr, dispatched to assassinate Alfonse, finds herself conflicted and chooses to defect, siding with the Order of Heroes to save her family.

Deceptions lurk around every corner, yet there is no choice but to move forward...

Gods have descended from the celestial realm Ásgarðr, and you are their target...

They have accused you of plotting to take control of the nine realms and seek to bring you to judgement. Amid this chaos, you and your allies meet a boy with special powers named Rune, who has fled Ásgarðr to escape the pursuit of the Celestial King.

Now, the Order of Heroes is fighting back with Rune at their side, even if it means challenging the Celestial King himself.

The twilight of the gods, Ragnarök, commences under Alfaðör, the creator of all.

Winter of annihilation... Wolf of annihilation... Sword of annihilation...

Dead gods rise as annihilation looms over the nine realms.

Fimbulvetr, the winter of annihilation, is first to descend—upon Nifl. Even the kingdom of snow and ice is not immune to the punishing winter of annihilation's icy grasp!
