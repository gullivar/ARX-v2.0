"Verint Predictive Modeling presently provides a comprehensive solution for buyers, offering a wealth of integrations and benchmarking and session replay capabilities."

Forrester, the Forrester Wave
Digital Voice-of-the-Customer Platforms Q2 2019, May 20, 2019

"We anticipate that [Verint Predictive Modeling] will become tightly integrated into the Verint Customer Engagement Solutions portfolio - and help enhance Verint's expertise in other parts of the business to create a more holistic solution for its customers."

Forrester, the Forrester Wave
Digital Voice-of-the-Customer Platforms Q2 2019, May 20, 2019

"Although it has origins in the contact center industry, Verint's focus on VoC and overall CX analytics is aimed at a broader enterprise market that is increasingly looking to control the customer relationship rather than simply react to it."
