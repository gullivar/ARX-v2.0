Built-in USB-JTAG Debugger

Bogged down with bugs? We have come up with a solution! ESP32 supports JTAG debugging, while ESP-WROVER-KIT integrates a USB debugger, as well. This makes debugging and tracing complex applications very easy, without the need for any additional hardware.

Advanced Hardware

ESP32 is engineered to be fast, smart and versatile. ESP-WROVER-KIT is an upgraded version of the ESP-WROVER-KIT. Its PSRAM is increased to 8 MBytes, while this dev board also features an on-board high-speed Micro-SD card interface, a VGA camera interface, a 3.2” SPI LCD panel and I/O expansion capabilities.
