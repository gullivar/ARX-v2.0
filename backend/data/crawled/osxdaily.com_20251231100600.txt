If you’d like to fine-tune the appearance of the Lock Screen Clock on iPhone with iOS 26, you’re now able to use a slider to adjust the intensity of Liquid Glass, going from full Liquid Glass where it’s nearly transparent, to a more frosted look that is slightly bezeled or embossed, and if you hate Liquid Glass, you can also choose the “Solid” option to make it look like the more traditional Lock Screen clock too.

These codes are one time use only and therefore don’t make a lot of sense to keep around forever, but manually going through and deleting all those verification codes from Messages and Mail can be annoying. Fortunately Apple has realized the endlessly piling up verification codes clutter is a hassle, and has created a handy optional feature that allows the operating system to automatically go through and delete those verification codes from your iPhone, Mac, or iPad, after they have been successfully used. This optional setting is particularly great when used in combination with the automatic security code fill feature available to macOS, iOS, and iPadOS too.

These are security update focused and do not introduce any changes or new features. Safari 26.2 is also available as an update to these MacOS versions.

The classic cartoon follows a child who is upset about the commercialization of Christmas, and features the entire Snoopy gang. It’s a family favorite, and many people have fond memories of watching the movie from various times in their life. While you can typically watch A Charlie Brown Christmas anytime on the paid Apple TV service, what’s unique about this particular offering is that, like the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving , it’s available for a limited weekend window to watch for free on Apple TV.

If you’re running macOS Tahoe, you will want to install macOS Tahoe 26.2. Update : macOS Tahoe 26.2 does not fix the Reduce Transparency bug where transparency remains prominent throughout MacOS even if enabled, with the accessibility feature being broken since the Tahoe 26.1 release . This is a feature many Mac users rely on to reduce overlapping text and other annoying legibility issues with Tahoe that did not exist in prior MacOS versions. Some users are also reporting a new bug/issue in MacOS Tahoe 26.2 where local networking between Macs running Tahoe and Sequoia no longer works. Aside from macOS Tahoe 26.2, Apple has also released iOS 26.2 for iPhone, iPadOS 26.2 for iPad , watchOS 26.2 for appleWatch, tvOS 26.2 for appleTV, and if you’re on a Mac that is not yet running Tahoe, you will find MacOS Sequoia 15.7.3, and macOS Sonoma 14.8.3.

New to iOS 26.2 is a slider for the Liquid Glass effect on the Lock Screen, Reminders app gains alarms, AirDrop includes an optional temporary code feature for users who are not in your contacts list, and iPadOS 26.2 reintroduces Slide Over drag-from-Dock as a multitasking option. Separately, Mac users will find macOS Tahoe 26.2 update available to download, along with macOS Sequoia 15.7.3, macOS Sonoma 14.8.3, watchOS 26.2, tOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2, and updates to other Apple devices as well.

It’s quite likely the final version of iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and MacOS Tahoe 26.2 will be released to the general public in the very near future, likely the coming days. iOS 26.2 includes a few tweaked and changes, including the ability to adjust how strong Liquid Glass is only on the Lock Screen of iPhone (would be nice to have this system wide, and on the Mac), Reminders gains an alarms feature, EU users get the Live Translation features on AirPods, a setting is available to flash the screen for alerts and notifications, and AirDrop gains a temporary access code features for sharing with users who are not in your contacts list. macOS Tahoe 26.2 includes FaceTime Edge / Ring Lighting feature that helps to improve lighting during video calls, and the Reminders app on MacOS gains alarms too. We will soon find out some annoying bugs have been addressed, including whether or not iCloud can work in Virtual Machines again, and if the bug where Reduce Transparency does not work entirely has been fixed with MacOS 26.2.

Developer Tyler Hall was annoyed enough by this with Tahoe that he created a simple app to draw an obvious border around the active window, called Alan*, and it’s available free. The effect of the Alan app is not particularly attractive, but, it is effective – it makes it very obvious what the active foreground window is, something that has gotten increasingly difficult in macOS Tahoe with Liquid Glass. In this way, Alan is sort of like an accessibility app for people who want to be able to quickly determine what window is the active window on a Mac. Read more » By Paul Horowitz - Customize , Mac OS - 4 Comments Release Candidate of iOS 26.2, macOS Tahoe 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, Available for Testing Dec 3, 2025 - 1 Comment A Release Candidate (RC) build of iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and MacOS Tahoe 26.2, have been released to those users participating in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. With the issuing of a Release Candidate build, it’s likely the final versions of these operating system versions will arrive next week. The new versions of system software include a variety of small new features, tweaks, adjustments, and bug fixes to the various operating systems. iOS 26.2 for iPhone introduces a slider to adjust how strong Liquid Glass presents on the Lock Screen (and given the overall reception of Liquid Glass, this should probably be introduced system-wide, and across all OS 26 operating systems). Reminders gains alarms, AirPods gains a Live Translation feature for EU users, you can have your screen flash for alerts, AirDrop gets a temporary access code feature for non-contact users, and more. On the Mac side of things with MacOS 26.2, FaceTime gets an Edge Lighting / Ring Lighting feature that aims to improve lighting during video calls, and Reminders gets alarms too. It’s unclear if the Reduce Transparency not working properly bug has been fixed with MacOS 26.2, or if the bug where iCloud does not work in virtual machines, has been resolved, amongst other problems reported by users.

This years commercial comes in at 2 minutes and features two friends taking a snowy hike, one of whom drops their iPhone into the snow, which is soon picked up by a forest creature, who proceeds to gather even more forest creatures to use the iPhone and stage a sing-and-dance. It’s goofy and fun, and all of the various animals are puppets, giving it sort of a Jim Henson vibe. The holiday ad is called “A Critter Carol”, with a tagline “This holiday, remember that friendship is a gift” , and the entire commercial was shot on an iPhone 17 Pro (which is also the same iPhone that drops into the snow).
