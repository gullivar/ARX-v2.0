“As soon as I deployed a VPS from HOSTRY, I witnessed faster website loading and higher user satisfaction, which led to a better conversion rate. With my new VPS I can easily scale up and down, which is very convenient for my projects with unstable traffic. Besides, now I don’t depend on other server users – no vulnerabilities, no worries!”
