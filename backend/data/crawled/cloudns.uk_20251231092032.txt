This is one of the most frequently used records in the DNS Zones. What is PTR record? - PTR records are used for the Reverse DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. Using the IP address you can get the associated domain/hostname. What is the CNAME record? - The CNAME record is also known as a canonical name record. It is used for specifying that a domain name is an alias for another domain, the "canonical" domain. Master DNS zone - The Master Zone also known as Primary Zone in the DNS server is the read or write copy of the DNS database. Slave DNS zone - The Slave/Backup DNS zone also known as Secondary is the read-only copy of the DNS records. This means that the DNS records cannot be added directly to the Slave/Backup DNS zone. What is a DNS query? - A DNS query (also known as a DNS request) is a demand for information sent from a user's computer (DNS client) to a DNS server.
