We're in the process of building something exciting in Private Equity and we will share more with you when it's ready.
What is private equity?
Private Equity (or PE) is a type of investment capital that owns all or parts of businesses that aren't publicly traded or listed. Typically, firms buy stakes in private companies, or take control of public companies and delist them from stock exchanges to take them private.

Returns from private equity have historically delivered well compared to other asset classes and help investors to diversify their portfolio against market cycles.
