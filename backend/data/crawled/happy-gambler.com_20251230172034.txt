Is Online Gambling Legal? Yes, it's legal for gamblers from the United Kingdom to place wagers on the internet. However, they must meet two important requirements, which are put in place by the UKGC. The first one is very easy; they need to be 18 years or older to place bets legally. And the second one is that UK gamblers have to sign up and place wagers at gambling sites that hold legitimate gambling licenses from the United Kingdom Gambling Commission.

The regulatory body itself was established in 2005 by the Gambling Act 2005. All forms of gambling, including sports betting, casino games, online poker, lottery-style games and bingo fall under the purview of the UKGC. Any individual wishing to provide these forms of online gambling to citizens of the United Kingdom must acquire a valid license from the organisation.

This is a great setup for UK gamblers since they have a massive array of fully licensed and regulated gambling platforms to pick from. Unlike other a few countries across the world, the UK Government does not criminalise gambling online. Instead, it nurtures a safe and secure gaming environment with protections for operators and players alike.

Gambling laws are oftentimes contradictory and vague in some countries across the globe. But this is not the case in the United Kingdom. Thanks to the 2005 Gambling Act, there is a clear framework for placing wagers online and hosting casino games. As a player, you just need to be 18 years and above to enjoy both playing casino games and placing bets on sports.

Beginner’s Guide to Online Gambling

If you’re thinking about playing in online casinos, then just know that you are not alone. With the online gambling industry absolutely exploding at present, it should come as no surprise that every individual is trying to get a share of the action. If you have no idea how online gambling websites work, then don’t be afraid since the help you need is right here.

First, it should be clear that online gambling sites should do very little to intimidate you. While online casinos may seem confusing and scary at first, these platforms are in most cases welcoming, and they will do everything to make all players feel comfortable.

In the next sections, you will find some key pieces of information that may be helpful to players who may be new to the world of online casinos and everything that relates to it. Some of the main things that you should keep in mind include the following:

You Should Find the Right Site

If you are looking for a top-notch gambling experience, then the first thing that you need to do is to find one of the best online gambling sites in the UK. Finding the best site isn’t something that’s easy to achieve. This is because not every online gambling website has been designed and created equally. When you’re looking for a perfect gaming destination, the first thing that you should do is to make a comprehensive list of things that you want your casino to have.

If you're a fan of slot machines, it will behove you to stay away from gaming websites that offer mostly video poker or live casino games. On the other hand, if you love playing slots, video poker and other games, you might want to find a site that offers different types of games from a massive array of software developers. When it comes to picking the best platform for you, it is something that you need to do personally. It’s important to consider all of the things that you need as a player. Only pick a site that blends smoothly with all of your gambling needs and requirements.

Do Your Homework

After creating a list of sites that have all of the features that you need, you should do your homework perfectly. In this case, the homework includes reading reviews of other players to know what they think about a given platform. While the opinion of other players may prove to be worthless in most cases, the online gambling industry isn’t one of them.

By searching online for user reviews and testimonials, you’ll be in a position to easily get a clear idea of what the public thinks about the casino that you are planning to sign up with. However, you should know that player testimonials and reviews aren’t always the most reliable way by which you can decide to sign up with a certain casino. This is because it’s much common that some players will talk about a bad time that they had at a given online casino faster than they would do for a good time that they had.

As a result of this, you’ll also need to check out some independent reviews of virtual casinos to determine which ones are ideal for you. Also, you will be able to know what some platforms offer that others don’t. Always take a little time to do some thorough research before accepting to sign up with any gambling site and claim the UK casino bonus available.

Cash-out limits.
The minimum deposit and bet required.
Game and deposit method limits.
