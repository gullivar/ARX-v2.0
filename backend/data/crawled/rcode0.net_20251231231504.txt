The classic addressing method on the Internet is based on unicast technology. This means that each DNS server has a globally unique IP address. All queries to this IP address are sent to one server, no matter where in the world the query originates. This may cause delays or time outs for remote clients. If the server is not reachable for some reason or is victim of a DoS attack, all services under this IP address are affected and stop working. Our product Rcode Zero DNS uses anycast technology. This ensures that your services are fail-safe, stable and optimally accessible. RcodeZero DNS stands for Anycast technology. Our Anycast servers are distributed all over the world and ensure that your online services are available under one and the same IP address. If one server fails, the next one takes over. The big advantage: This not only reduces the response times of the DNS servers, but also spreads the total server load over the entire network. DNS Tips: Secure operation of authoritative name servers and protection against outages. The DNS (Domain Name System) is the basis for all domain-based services, enabling the resolution of IP-addresses for critical services such as your company’s website, online shops, e-mail communication, internal services like ERP systems, databases, and many more. Given its central role, the stability and resilience of your DNS infrastructure is crucial. Watch the videos for valuable tips and tricks on how to operate authoritative nameservers securely.
