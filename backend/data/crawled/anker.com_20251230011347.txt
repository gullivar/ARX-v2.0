"Excellent product. It is primarily designed for use with a MacBook or other USB-C charging laptop. I use it on my hiking pack and it is perfect for that. I use the loop cord to attach it to the compression strap on the side of my backpack and it stays secure. I haven’t had it fall off. Well, the second cord is free and very handy to charge my phone on the go."
