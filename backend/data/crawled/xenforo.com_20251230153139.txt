Keep your users involved

Make it easy for your users to get notified with updates that are applicable to them. They'll receive alerts whenever someone replies to them, reacts to one of their posts, and more. Users can even have notifications pushed to their devices so they can see them without being on your site.

Discover new content

Make sure your users can see the latest updates on your forum with the dedicated "What's new" section or by browsing the news feed to see all of the latest happenings, beyond just the messages being posted.

More than just likes

Let your users react to posts with more than just a like. They could be laughing, surprised, upset, or more. Setup reactions for any sentiment you want, with a custom icon and color for each reaction. Let reactions contribute to a score to help you identify your most engaging users.

Control access your way

Use XenForo's powerful permission system to control who can access certain areas and features. Create a forum that only project members can access. Prevent a troublemaker from posting in a specific forum. XenForo can be setup to fit your needs.

Styled to fit your brand

XenForo's look and feel can be totally customized to fit your brand. Quickly change the colors and logo to make your site directly from the control panel, no code changes necessary. Want more control? All of the HTML and CSS can be customized.

Built to be extended

XenForo has been built from the ground up to be extended and customized. Our community has released over 1000 add-ons. Or if you want to build something yourself, you can use our REST API or build your custom functions directly into the XenForo framework, taking advantage of all of the systems that are built in.
