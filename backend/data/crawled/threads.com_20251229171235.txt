Melvin Sokolsky’s photograph captures pure magic — a woman floating in a transparent bubble above Paris, like a modern-day Glinda. His surreal, poetic style redefined fashion photography, turning it into dreamlike storytelling.
🫧 Melvin Sokolsky, Bubble, Bois de Boulogne, Paris, 1963. Available in our Discoveries: Photographs auction, live through December 17.
