About



We're a community-funded research lab of 60 people known for building the most beautiful AI models in the world.




We believe that we are all midjourney: that we have a rich past behind us and an unimaginable future ahead — and the question we want to most help answer is: what do we want to become?

Projects



Over the coming months, we’re unveiling a wide range of ambitious projects under the themes of imagination, coordination, reflection, beauty, and human flourishing.




We hope our work will help tell stories of a humane future that we all want to be a part of, and convince you that we aren’t at the end of time, or the beginning, but that we are all midjourney in a vast and great adventure.
