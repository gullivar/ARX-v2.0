Why leading brands are shifting marketing budget to partnerships
Paid ads hit a ceiling

Brands spent $1 trillion on ads last year while acquisition efficiency continues to drop. Performance partnerships offer a better model.

Consumers trust people, not ads

89% trust personal recommendations over advertising. 2/3 of the world engages with creators daily, who now command 25% of social marketing budgets.

AI accelerates everything

AI-generated retail traffic grew 4,700% YoY. 39% of shoppers use AI for purchases, and 35% of Gen Z use AI search daily.
