The netfilter project is a community-driven collaborative FOSS project that provides packet filtering software for the Linux 2.4.x and later kernel series. The
netfilter project is commonly associated with iptables and its successor nftables . The netfilter project enables packet filtering, network address [and port]
translation (NA[P]T), packet logging, userspace packet queueing and other
packet mangling. The netfilter hooks are a framework inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel
modules to register callback functions at different locations of the Linux
network stack. The registered callback function is then called back for every
packet that traverses the respective hook within the Linux network stack. iptables is a generic firewalling
software that allows you to define rulesets.  Each rule within an IP table
consists of a number of classifiers (iptables matches) and one connected action
(iptables target). nftables is the successor of iptables , it allows for much more
flexible, scalable and performance packet classification. This is where all the
fancy new features are developed. Main Features stateless packet filtering (IPv4 and IPv6) stateful packet filtering (IPv4 and IPv6) all kinds of network address and port translation, e.g. NAT/NAPT (IPv4 and IPv6) flexible and extensible infrastructure multiple layers of API's for 3rd party extensions What can I do with netfilter? build internet firewalls based on stateless and stateful packet filtering deploy highly available stateless and stateful firewall clusters use NAT and masquerading for sharing internet access if you don't have enough public IP addresses use NAT to implement transparent proxies aid the tc and iproute2 systems used to build sophisticated QoS and policy routers do further packet manipulation (mangling) like altering the TOS/DSCP/ECN bits of the IP header What value does nftables provide? a single tool with consistent syntax as opposed to the fragmented {ip,ip6,eb,arp}tables and ipset faster kernel-side transactional ruleset updates, no need for user-space locking sets are more flexible and powerful than ipset, maps push the concept even further full ruleset flexibility: no pre-defined tables and chains arbitrary number of user-defined tables to separate the ruleset into "namespaces" base chain's hook and priority are configurable more flexible rules: No mandatory parts (like counters), multiple actions allowed (e.g. log and drop) ingress hook attaching a chain to an interface for early filtering right after TC egress hook attaching a chain to an interface for transmit path filtering right before TC flowtables provide a software fast path and hardware acceleration some limited scripting ability embedded in the syntax (define variables, include other files), support for extensive scripting via JSON input and output Licensing terms netfilter.org develops software within the Linux kernel, which is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL-2.0) and compatible licenses.
