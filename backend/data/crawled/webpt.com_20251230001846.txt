Therapists built us.
WebPT’s story began with a rehab therapist frustrated by software that didn’t match how they worked or what they truly needed.

Fueled by that firsthand experience and a passion to make a real difference, we set out to build more than just software. We created a purpose-built platform designed specifically for rehab therapy to power efficiency, grow revenue, and help therapists like you manage every aspect of your practice.
‍
Today, hundreds of thousands of therapists rely on WebPT to work smarter, get paid faster, and run their practice with confidence—so they can focus on patients and leave work at work.

Previously, trying to figure out what we were actually earning per patient and CPT code was a constant headache. WebPT's reporting finally gave us a clear picture of those crucial numbers, which are essential for running the practice effectively.

“Therabill is magic. We had a biller come on with a lot of years of experience, and she just wouldn’t shut up about how much she liked Therabill—about how simple it was to submit claims, to follow up on them, and to keep track of them. Then [she] went on to brag about how quickly we were getting paid. It was a delight to hear, because my four previous experiences [with a billing software] were not like that. I wish I had just chosen Therabill right away. It’s been a breeze.”

We are getting reimbursed much quicker than we expected to as a new practice. Most insurances are paying us within two or three weeks, and some claims have even been paid in as little as five days!
