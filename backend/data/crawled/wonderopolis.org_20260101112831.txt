Those are some pretty big numbers, but we prefer to measure the last 15 years in other ways. Now Wonderopolis has over 2,900 Wonders of the Day®, 280,753 questions in the Wonder Bank, and more than 45 million Wonder Friends around the globe! These are the numbers we’re truly proud of. However, even the best adventures must eventually come to an end. Today, we’re announcing that Wonderopolis.org will permanently close on July 31, 2025 . Does this mean the WONDER is over? Of course not! Here’s how you can stay curious this summer and beyond: Between now and July 31, revisit your favorite Wonders—and maybe find some new favorites along the way! Pro tip: You can use the “Print” button at the top of each Wonder to save it as a PDF. Read (or re-read) Wonder of the Day #2969: How Do We Wonder? to learn how to create your very own Wonders. Then, explore a topic you’re curious about with help from a family member. Back in 2010, we set out to create a place for natural curiosity and imagination to drive learning and discovery—and for nearly 15 years, we’ve been proud to share that place with you.
