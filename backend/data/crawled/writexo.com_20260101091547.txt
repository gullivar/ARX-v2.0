Can I share my documents and projects with others? + Absolutely! Every document, kanban board, and project gets a unique share link that you can send to anyone.

This makes it easy to share professionally formatted documents with clients, use your content in other applications, or create polished reports and presentations from your WriteXO workspace. Can I use WriteXO offline? + WriteXO is currently a web-based application that requires an internet connection. However, your notes are automatically saved as you type, so you won't lose any work if your connection drops temporarily. We're exploring offline capabilities for future updates.
