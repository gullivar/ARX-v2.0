FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Can I cancel my paid subscription at any time?

Yes. You can cancel your plan at any time. You can continue to enjoy your payment plan until the end of the current billing cycle. Once it is terminated, your account will become free.

Can the plan be extended at any time?

If you want to upgrade your plan, you can do so anytime. The paid and unused portion of the previous plan will be deducted from the price of the new plan.

Is it possible to connect several Google Business Profiles under the same brand?

Each Metricool brand corresponds to a single location, so you’ll need a separate brand for each Google Business Profile. This allows you to schedule tailored content and track performance independently for each location. If you want combined reports across multiple brands, you can do this using the Looker Studio Connector (available on the Advanced Plan), which lets you include data from several brands in a single custom report.

What is a brand in Metricool?

Each brand in Metricool represents a business, brand, or customer. Under each brand, you can manage 1 profile for each social network or ad platform.

What are the main differences between a STARTER and ADVANCED plan?

The ADVANCED plan offers everything in the Starter plan, plus additional features to manage more brands and streamline your workflow:
Collaborators: Give clients or team members access to a specific brand without exposing data from others.
Looker Studio & API access: Create in-depth, customized reports and connect Metricool with other tools.
Custom report templates: Design reports that fit your needs and branding.
Zapier integration: Automate processes and save time on repetitive tasks.

Is Metricool free?

Yes! You can use Metricool for free, forever. With our Free plan, you can connect 1 brand associated to a profile for each social network, plan your content, publish content automatically, manage messages from your networks, and more.

Can I downgrade my current subscription?
