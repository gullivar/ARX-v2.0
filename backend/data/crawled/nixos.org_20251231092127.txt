          system configuration. Learn how to make reproducible, declarative and
          reliable systems. Download Get started Reproducible Nix builds packages in isolation from each other. This ensures that they are reproducible and don’t have undeclared dependencies, so if a package works on one machine, it will also work on another. Declarative Nix makes it trivial to share development and build environments for your projects, regardless of what programming languages and tools you’re using. Reliable Nix ensures that installing or upgrading one package cannot break other packages . It allows you to roll back to previous versions , and ensures that no package is in an inconsistent state during an upgrade. Choose from over 120 000 Packages The Nix Packages collection ( Nixpkgs ) offers a large selection of packages for the Nix package manager.
