But it took me nearly 15 years to get there. And I realized I could have gotten to the $1,000,000/year mark much faster if I had the systems and processes I have today. 
Sales, in particular, unlocked a new level of growth for my businesses. In fact, my current agency, Quantum Leads, generated over $1,000,000 in less than a year after I implemented my lead generation system.I wished I knew about this system years ago. So I decided to package it into the Sales Accelerator and offer it to you.
