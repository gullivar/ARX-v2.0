The TOGAF® Standard, a standard of The Open Group

The TOGAF® Standard, a standard of The Open Group, is a proven Enterprise Architecture methodology and framework used by the world’s leading organizations to improve business efficiency.

The standard is constantly evolving as a result of the work delivered by members of The Open Group Architecture Forum and TOGAF certification has been achieved by nearly 150,000 individuals worldwide.

The Portfolio of Digital Open Standards

While all standards of The Open Group® can and are adopted and used independently of one another, the greatest value for an organization can be derived when they are used in unison – the sum of the parts should be greater than the whole. The “Portfolio of Digital Open Standards” is a collection of open standards developed by The Open Group, a global consortium that promotes and develops best practices to support organizations through their journey to become digital.

By using The Portfolio of Digital Open Standards, organizations will find guidance on how to transform their business and operational models to deliver and support digital products using digital platforms reducing  complexity and pursuing consistency.
