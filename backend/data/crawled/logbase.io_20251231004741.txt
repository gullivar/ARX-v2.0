Testimonials
What our 40,000+ customers say about us

Shipeasy has been great so far! I went through about 10 different shipping apps before finding shipeasy (including 5 recommended from shopify support team) But nothing was working for me until now! Highly recommend this app.

KingofMattresses

Really appreciate their customer service and their app. I just added it to my store and increased sales by over $2k in the first few days which is great for a small business. 

Cambodian Hair Freak LLC

Dealeasy is a great app. You can easily set up discounts for multiple purchases. Also, when I had a problem, it was resolved very quickly. I highly recommend it.

JapanHapiness- Japan

10/10 would recommend! I am not a very tech savvy person however the set up was quite easy and any issues. The team helped to ensure the collect/delivery section was running properly. Thank you so much!!

Crumbzillas bakery, UK

We use Pickeasy app in our store. It has increased our sales by making it easy to offer product customization and options to our customers. Customer service responded quickly when we had queries.

The Balloon Diva

Pickeasy is the most useful app to manage both delivery and collection orders. I couldn't manage my store without this app, and the customer support is efficient and always friendly!
