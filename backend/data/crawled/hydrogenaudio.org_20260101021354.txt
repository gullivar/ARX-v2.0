Anna's Archive "backed up Spotify"

Backing up Spotify

annas-archive.li/blog, 2025-12-20, Discuss on Hacker News

We backed up Spotify (metadata).

This release includes the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks and 186 million unique ISRCs.



(edit Spoons note - re [TOS 9]: Google AI: "No, music album names are not copyrightable. Under intellectual property laws in the United States and many other jurisdictions, copyright does not protect short phrases, titles, or slogans. "

So the metadata titles are fair game as far as copyright goes, the first release of metadata would not fall foul of copyright laws)

[OPEN SORUCE] Straw - lossless codec for efficiently storing multichannel audio
2025-12-03 16:56:56 by forart.eu | Views: 2652 | Comments: 0
Straw is a lossless audio codec derived from FLAC but redesigned for multi-channel material and simplified framing. It maintains LPC prediction and Rice residual coding while adding mechanisms to exploit similarities between channels. The result is a format that is structurally simpler than FLAC and often more efficient when many microphones or correlated signals are involved.

Summary:
• Adds correction data for multi-channel alignment (shift, bias, gain).
• Provides per-channel shift matrices and removed-sample alignment information.
• Removes FLAC block-size tables, sample-rate codes, channel-assignment codes, wasted-bits, and many reserved fields.
• Uses a new 14-bit sync code and non-byte-aligned subframes. 
• Supports both standard Rice and FF-Rice residual coders.
• Designed to improve compression for multi-channel audio compared to FLAC.
