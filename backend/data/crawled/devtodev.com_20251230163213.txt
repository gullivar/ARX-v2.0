CUSTOMER STORIES

Devtodev has been instrumental in helping us align our teams through consistent metrics, reducing confusion, and fostering a shared data culture. It empowers everyone to speak the same data language, enabling better collaboration and decision-making across the organization.
Samuel Surgent
Co-Founder, CMO
Devtodev is a critical part of our analytics process. We use it to analyze and optimize every step of our player journey, from the first launch to the end game experience. The tutorial analysis is a top notch feature, and the in-game analysis tools are simply the best we've seen, providing clear and actionable information to improve the in-game economy and our monetization.
Quentin Sallat
Co-Founder
BoomBit have been working with devtodev since 2020. Their unique things are communication and responsiveness - there is always someone to help or answer the questions. For me, devtodev is awesome because of their openness to change, and they also give me plenty of possibilities feature-wise. The database responsiveness is very good in comparison to other solutions.
Michał Korek
Head of Analytics
We’ve been with devtodev for 4 years. The most useful features for us are real time analytics and daily reports to Slack. We’ve got extremely positive experience with them. The team is super flexible. They promptly replied to all our requests and fixed a few bugs as fast as possible.
Andrii Chaika
CTO
Working with devtodev team gives us a new perspective which lets us understand our users behavior better. Moreover, it helps us optimize our game flow by improving our KPI's.
Can Erçelebi
Managing Partner
We took a consultancy service from devtodev about our flagship game Drift Max Pro. Their team was very helpful and open-minded and reports they presented helped us learn a lot about the game economy and unblocking some bottlenecks. We at Tiramisu fixed some minor bugs and it helped us get higher retention values.
Cengiz Zorlu
Product Manager
We are positively surprised with the direction of devtodev development - latest changes allowing deeper custom investigations (SQL reports, formulas in custom event reports) are really helpful.
Michał Wiśniewski
BI Engineer
I definitely recommend devtodev - they got all the features you’ll need, reasonable price, and all the support you will ever need. It has all the crucial features modern analytics needs and keeps delivering the new ones. I really like the automatic calculation of paying segments’ average revenue, RFM analysis and purchase distribution.
Roman Tihonskiy
Head of Analytics
I do really like the general overview of the game: it takes a few minutes to understand how it goes in terms of main important metrics. The team is super friendly and quickly helped solve all the problems during the integration process.
Michael Kuzmin
Marketing Director
With devtodev, we have a complete set of tools to help us understand our users. Functionality that devtodev provides us with, not only completely meets the company’s demanding requirements, but also gives a highly scalable foundation for continuing rapid growth.
Alexey Sheremetyev

The main reason for choosing a ready analytics solution is that devtodev gives us all the insights we need while saving resources for our team. The SDK is quick to integrate, no need for our dev team to work on the tool, improve it and guarantee stability. In the end, it results in much less cost and investment.
