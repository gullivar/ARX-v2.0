Ubuntu Security Notices

Developers issue an Ubuntu Security Notice when a security issue is fixed in an official Ubuntu package. You can find additional guidance for high-profile vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu Vulnerability Knowledge Base section.

To report a security vulnerability in an Ubuntu package, please contact the Security Team.

The Security Team also produces OVAL files for each Ubuntu release. These are an industry-standard machine-readable format dataset that contain details of all known security vulnerabilities and fixes relevant to the Ubuntu release, and can be used to determine whether a particular patch is appropriate. OVAL files can also be used to audit a system to check whether the latest security fixes have been applied.
